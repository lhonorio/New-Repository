### THE HITCHHICKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY ###

Chapter 1 


The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village. It 
stood on its own and looked over a broad spread of West Country 
farmland. Not a remarkable house by any means - it was about thirty 
years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows 
set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly 
failed to please the eye. 

The only person for whom the house was in any way special was 
Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he 
lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had 
moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He 
was about thirty as well, dark haired and never quite at ease with 
himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that 
people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. 
He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a 
lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too - most of 
his friends worked in advertising. 

It hadn't properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to 
knock down his house and build an bypass instead. 

At eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very good. 
He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, 
opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped 
off to the bathroom to wash. 

Toothpaste on the brush - so. Scrub. 

Shaving mirror - pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a 
moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom 
window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent's bristles. He 
shaved them off, washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen to 
find something pleasant to put in his mouth. 

Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn. 

The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in 
search of something to connect with. 



The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one. 

He stared at it. 

"Yellow," he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get 
dressed. 

Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, 
and another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he 
hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that 
he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. "Yellow," 
he thought and stomped on to the bedroom. 

He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He 
vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that 
seemed important. He'd been telling people about it, telling people 
about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual 
recollection was of glazed looks on other people's faces. Something 
about a new bypass he had just found out about. It had been in the 
pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it. 
Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he'd 
decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn't have a leg to 
stand on. It would sort itself out. 

God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked 
at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. "Yellow," 
he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of 
something to connect with. 

Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a 
big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path. 

Mr. L Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was 
a carbon-based life form descended from an ape. More specifically he 
was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously 
enough, though he didn't know it, he was also a direct male-line 
descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and 
racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible 
Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr. L Prosser 
of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the turn 
and a predilection for little fur hats. 

He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous 
worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried because 



something had gone seriously wrong with his job - which was to see 
that Arthur Dent's house got cleared out of the way before the day 
was out. 

"Come off it, Mr. Dent,", he said, "you can't win you know. You 
can't lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely." He tried to make his 
eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn't do it. 

Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him. 

"I'm game," he said, "we'll see who rusts first." 

"I'm afraid you're going to have to accept it," said Mr. Prosser 
gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head, "this 
bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built!" 

"First I've heard of it," said Arthur, "why's it going to be built?" 

Mr. Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put 
it away again. 

"What do you mean, why's it got to be built?" he said. "It's a bypass. 
You've got to build bypasses." 

Bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point 
A to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to point A 
very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, 
are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many 
people of point B are so keen to get there, and what's so great about 
point B that so many people of point A are so keen to get there. They 
often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the 
hell they wanted to be. 

Mr. Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn't anywhere in 
particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from 
points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with 
axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, 
which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife of course wanted 
climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn't know why - he just 
liked axes. He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer 
drivers. 

He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally 
uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly 
incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn't him. 

Mr. Prosser said: "You were quite entitled to make any suggestions 
or protests at the appropriate time you know." 



"Appropriate time?" hooted Arthur. "Appropriate time? The first I 
knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I 
asked him if he'd come to clean the windows and he said no he'd 
come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me straight away of course. 
Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver. 
Then he told me." 

"But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning 
office for the last nine month." 

"Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, 
yesterday afternoon. You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call 
attention to them had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or 
anything." 

"But the plans were on display..." 

"On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find 
them." 

"That's the display department." 

"With a torch." 

"Ah, well the lights had probably gone." 

"So had the stairs." 

"But look, you found the notice didn't you?" 

"Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a 
locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the 
door saying Beware of the Leopard." 

A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he 
lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over 
Arthur Dent's house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it. 

"It's not as if it's a particularly nice house," he said. 

"I'm sorry, but I happen to like it." 

"You'll like the bypass." 

"Oh shut up," said Arthur Dent. "Shut up and go away, and take 
your bloody bypass with you. You haven't got a leg to stand on and 
you know it." 

Mr. Prosser's mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his 
mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive 
visions of Arthur Dent's house being consumed with fire and Arthur 
himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three 



hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr. Prosser was often 
bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. 
He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together. 

"Mr. Dent," he said. 

"Hello? Yes?" said Arthur. 

"Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much 
damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over 
you?" 

"How much?" said Arthur. 

"None at all," said Mr. Prosser, and stormed nervously off 
wondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen 
all shouting at him. 

By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion 
the ape-descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends 
was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in 
the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually 
claimed. 

Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this. 

This friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen Earth 
years previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth 
society - with, it must be said, some success. For instance he had 
spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out of work actor, which 
was plausible enough. 

He had made one careless blunder though, because he had 
skimped a bit on his preparatory research. The information he had 
gathered had led him to choose the name "Ford Prefect" as being 
nicely inconspicuous. 

He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not 
conspicuously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed 
backwards from the temples. His skin seemed to be pulled backwards 
from the nose. There was something very slightly odd about him, but 
it was difficult to say what it was. Perhaps it was that his eyes didn't 
blink often enough and when you talked to him for any length of time 
your eyes began involuntarily to water on his behalf. Perhaps it was 
that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people the unnerving 
impression that he was about to go for their neck. 



He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, 
but a harmless one - an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For 
instance he would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk 
and start making fun of any astrophysicist he could find till he got 
thrown out. 

Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and 
stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he 
was doing. Then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin. 

"Oh, just looking for flying saucers," he would joke and everyone 
would laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was looking 
for. 

"Green ones!" he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a 
moment and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an 
enormous round of drinks. 

Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his 
skull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her 
in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn't 
matter that much really. 

Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he 
would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to 
Betelgeuse. The policemen would usually say something like, "Don't 
you think it's about time you went off home sir?" 

"I'm trying to baby, I'm trying to," is what Ford invariably replied on 
these occasions. 

In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared 
distractedly into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer at all. The 
reason he said green was that green was the traditional space livery 
of the Betelgeuse trading scouts. 

Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would 
arrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded 
anywhere, particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth. 

Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he 
knew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them. He 
knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty 
Altairan dollars a day. 

In fact. Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly 
remarkable book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 



Human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the 
environs of Arthur's house had settled into a steady routine. It was 
Arthur's accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making occasional 
demands to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book; it was Mr. 
Prosser's accepted role to tackle Arthur with the occasional new ploy 
such as the For the Public Good talk, the March of Progress talk, the 
They Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never Looked Back 
talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bulldozer 
drivers' accepted role to sit around drinking coffee and experimenting 
with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to 
their financial advantage. 

The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course. 

The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in. 

A shadow moved across him again. 

"Hello Arthur," said the shadow. 

Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see 
Ford Prefect standing above him. 

"Ford! Hello, how are you?" 

"Fine," said Ford, "look, are you busy?" 

"Am I busy?" exclaimed Arthur. "Well, I've just got all these 
bulldozers and things to lie in front of because they'll knock my house 
down if I don't, but other than that... well, no not especially, why?" 

They don't have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often 
failed to notice it unless he was concentrating. He said, "Good, is 
there anywhere we can talk?" 

"What?" said Arthur Dent. 

For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly 
into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car. Then suddenly 
he squatted down beside Arthur. 

"We've got to talk," he said urgently. 

"Fine," said Arthur, "talk." 

"And drink," said Ford. "It's vitally important that we talk and drink. 
Now. We'll go to the pub in the village." 

He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant. 



"Look, don't you understand?" shouted Arthur. He pointed at 
Prosser. "That man wants to knock my house down!" 

Ford glanced at him, puzzled. 

"Well he can do it while you're away can't he?" he asked. 

"But I don't want him to!" 

"Ah." 

"Look, what's the matter with you Ford?" said Arthur. 

"Nothing. Nothing's the matter. Listen to me - I've got to tell you 
the most important thing you've ever heard. I've got to tell you now, 
and I've got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom." 

"But why?" 

"Because you are going to need a very stiff drink." 

Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find that his 
will was beginning to weaken. He didn't realize that this was because 
of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in the hyperspace 
ports that served the madranite mining belts in the star system of 
Orion Beta. 

The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, 
and was played like this: 

Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in 
front of each of them. 

Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as 
immortalized in that ancient Orion mining song "Oh don't give me 
none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ No, don't you give me none more 
of that Old Janx Spirit/ For my head will fly, my tongue will lie, my 
eyes will fry and I may die/ Won't you pour me one more of that sinful 
Old Janx Spirit"). 

Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on 
the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his 
opponent - who would then have to drink it. 

The bottle would then be refilled. The game would be played again. 
And again. 

Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because 
one of the effects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic power. 



As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final 
loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely 
biological. 

Ford Prefect usually played to lose. 


Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want 
to go to the Florse and Groom after all. 

"But what about my house...?" he asked plaintively. 

Ford looked across to Mr. Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought 
struck him. 

"Fie wants to knock your house down?" 

"Yes, he wants to build..." 

"And he can't because you're lying in front of the bulldozers?" 

"Yes, and..." 

"I'm sure we can come to some arrangement," said Ford. "Excuse 
me!" he shouted. 

Mr. Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer 
drivers about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental health 
hazard, and how much they should get paid if he did) looked around. 
Fie was surprised and slightly alarmed to find that Arthur had 
company. 

"Yes? Flello?" he called. "Flas Mr. Dent come to his senses yet?" 

"Can we for the moment," called Ford, "assume that he hasn't?" 

"Well?" sighed Mr. Prosser. 

"And can we also assume," said Ford, "that he's going to be staying 
here all day?" 

"So?" 

"So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing 
nothing?" 

"Could be, could be..." 

"Well, if you're resigned to doing that anyway, you don't actually 
need him to lie here all the time do you?" 

"What?" 


"You don't," said Ford patiently, "actually need him here." 



Mr. Prosser thought about this. 

"Well no, not as such...", he said, "not exactly need..." Prosser was 
worried. He thought that one of them wasn't making a lot of sense. 

Ford said, "So if you would just like to take it as read that he's 
actually here, then he and I could slip off down to the pub for half an 
hour. How does that sound?" 

Mr. Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty. 

"That sounds perfectly reasonable," he said in a reassuring tone of 
voice, wondering who he was trying to reassure. 

"And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on," said 
Ford, "we can always cover up for you in return." 

"Thank you very much," said Mr. Prosser who no longer knew how 
to play this at all, "thank you very much, yes, that's very kind..." He 
frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once, failed, grasped 
hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round the top of his head. He 
could only assume that he had just won. 

"So," continued Ford Prefect, "if you would just like to come over 
here and lie down..." 

"What?" said Mr. Prosser. 

"Ah, I'm sorry," said Ford, "perhaps I hadn't made myself fully clear. 
Somebody's got to lie in front of the bulldozers haven't they? Or there 
won't be anything to stop them driving into Mr. Dent's house will 
there?" 

"What?" said Mr. Prosser again. 

"It's very simple," said Ford, "my client, Mr. Dent, says that he will 
stop lying here in the mud on the sole condition that you come and 
take over from him." 

"What are you talking about?" said Arthur, but Ford nudged him 
with his shoe to be quiet. 

"You want me," said Mr. Prosser, spelling out this new thought to 
himself, "to come and lie there..." 

"Yes." 

"In front of the bulldozer?" 

"Yes." 

"Instead of Mr. Dent." 

"Yes." 



"In the mud." 

"In, as you say it, the mud." 

As soon as Mr. Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser 
after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself off his shoulders: this was 
more like the world as he knew it. He sighed. 

"In return for which you will take Mr. Dent with you down to the 
pub?" 

"That's it," said Ford. "That's it exactly." 

Mr. Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped. 

"Promise?" 

"Promise," said Ford. He turned to Arthur. 

"Come on," he said to him, "get up and let the man lie down." 

Arthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream. 

Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the 
mud. He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he 
sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying 
it. The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed 
into his shoes. 

Ford looked at him severely. 

"And no sneaky knocking down Mr. Dent's house whilst he's away, 
alright?" he said. 

"The mere thought," growled Mr. Prosser, "hadn't even begun to 
speculate," he continued, settling himself back, "about the merest 
possibility of crossing my mind." 

He saw the bulldozer driver's union representative approaching 
and let his head sink back and closed his eyes. He was trying to 
marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute a 
mental health hazard himself. He was far from certain about this - his 
mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and the stench of 
blood. This always happened when he felt miserable and put upon, 
and he had never been able to explain it to himself. In a high 
dimension of which we know nothing the mighty Khan bellowed with 
rage, but Mr. Prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered. He 
began to fell little pricks of water behind the eyelids. Bureaucratic 
cock-ups, angry men lying in the mud, indecipherable strangers 
handing out inexplicable humiliations and an unidentified army of 
horsemen laughing at him in his head - what a day. 



What a day. Ford Prefect knew that it didn't matter a pair of 
dingo's kidneys whether Arthur's house got knocked down or not now. 
Arthur remained very worried. 

"But can we trust him?" he said. 

"Myself I'd trust him to the end of the Earth," said Ford. 

"Oh yes," said Arthur, "and how far's that?" 

"About twelve minutes away," said Ford, "come on, I need a drink." 



Chapter 2 


Here's what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol. It 
says that alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the 
fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect on certain 
carbon-based life forms. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol. It says 
that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. 

It says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having 
your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large 
gold brick. 

The Guide also tells you on which planets the best Pan Galactic 
Gargle Blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one 
and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate 
afterwards. 

The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself. 

Take the juice from one bottle of that 01' Janx Spirit, it says. 

Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V - 
Oh that Santraginean sea water, it says. Oh those Santraginean fish!!! 

Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it 
must be properly iced or the benzine is lost). 

Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in 
memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the 
Marshes of Fallia. 

Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin 
Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark 
Qualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic. 

Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, 
spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the 
drink. 

Sprinkle Zamphuor. 

Add an olive. 



Drink... but... very carefully... 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than the 
Encyclopedia Galactica. 

"Six pints of bitter," said Ford Prefect to the barman of the Horse 
and Groom. "And quickly please, the world's about to end." 

The barman of the Horse and Groom didn't deserve this sort of 
treatment, he was a dignified old man. He pushed his glasses up his 
nose and blinked at Ford Prefect. Ford ignored him and stared out of 
the window, so the barman looked instead at Arthur who shrugged 
helplessly and said nothing. 

So the barman said, "Oh yes sir? Nice weather for it," and started 
pulling pints. 

He tried again. 

"Going to watch the match this afternoon then?" 

Ford glanced round at him. 

"No, no point," he said, and looked back out of the window. 

"What's that, foregone conclusion then you reckon sir?" said the 
barman. "Arsenal without a chance?" 

"No, no," said Ford, "it's just that the world's about to end." 

"Oh yes sir, so you said," said the barman, looking over his glasses 
this time at Arthur. "Lucky escape for Arsenal if it did." 

Ford looked back at him, genuinely surprised. 

"No, not really," he said. He frowned. 

The barman breathed in heavily. "There you are sir, six pints," he 
said. 

Arthur smiled at him wanly and shrugged again. He turned and 
smiled wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them had heard 
what was going on. 

None of them had, and none of them could understand what he 
was smiling at them for. 

A man sitting next to Ford at the bar looked at the two men, looked 
at the six pints, did a swift burst of mental arithmetic, arrived at an 
answer he liked and grinned a stupid hopeful grin at them. 

"Get off," said Ford, "They're ours," giving him a look that would 
have an Algolian Suntiger get on with what it was doing. 



Ford slapped a five-pound note on the bar. He said, "Keep the 
change." 

"What, from a fiver? Thank you sir." 

"You've got ten minutes left to spend it." 

The barman simply decided to walk away for a bit. 

"Ford," said Arthur, "would you please tell me what the hell is 
going on?" 

"Drink up," said Ford, "you've got three pints to get through." 

"Three pints?" said Arthur. "At lunchtime?" 

The man next to ford grinned and nodded happily. Ford ignored 
him. He said, "Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so." 

"Very deep," said Arthur, "you should send that in to the Reader's 
Digest. They've got a page for people like you." 

"Drink up." 

"Why three pints all of a sudden?" 

"Muscle relaxant, you'll need it." 

"Muscle relaxant?" 

"Muscle relaxant." 

Arthur stared into his beer. 

"Did I do anything wrong today," he said, "or has the world always 
been like this and I've been too wrapped up in myself to notice?" 

"Alright," said Ford, "I'll try to explain. How long have we known 
each other?" 

"How long?" Arthur thought. "Er, about five years, maybe six," he 
said. "Most of it seemed to make some sense at the time." 

"Alright," said Ford. "How would you react if I said that I'm not 
from Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the 
vicinity of Betelgeuse?" 

Arthur shrugged in a so-so sort of way. 

"I don't know," he said, taking a pull of beer. "Why - do you think 
it's the sort of thing you're likely to say?" 

Ford gave up. It really wasn't worth bothering at the moment, what 
with the world being about to end. He just said: 

"Drink up." 

He added, perfectly factually: 



"The world's about to end." 

Arthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile. The rest of the 
pub frowned at him. A man waved at him to stop smiling at them and 
mind his own business. 

"This must be Thursday," said Arthur musing to himself, sinking low 
over his beer, "I never could get the hang of Thursdays." 



Chapter 3 


On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through 
the ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet; several 
somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike 
somethings, huge as office buildings, silent as birds. They soared with 
ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the star Sol, biding their 
time, grouping, preparing. 

The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their 
presence, which was just how they wanted it for the moment. The 
huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed 
over Cape Canaveral without a blip, Woomera and Jodrell Bank 
looked straight through them - which was a pity because it was 
exactly the sort of thing they'd been looking for all these years. 

The only place they registered at all was on a small black device 
called a Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic which winked away quietly to itself. It 
nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which Ford Prefect 
wore habitually round his neck. The contents of Ford Prefect's satchel 
were quite interesting in fact and would have made any Earth 
physicist's eyes pop out of his head, which is why he always concealed 
them by keeping a couple of dog-eared scripts for plays he pretended 
he was auditioning for stuffed in the top. Besides the Sub-Etha Sens- 
O-Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb - a short squat 
black rod, smooth and matt with a couple of flat switches and dials at 
one end; he also had a device which looked rather like a largish 
electronic calculator. This had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons 
and a screen about four inches square on which any one of a million 
"pages" could be summoned at a moment's notice. It looked insanely 
complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic 
cover it fitted into had the words Don't Panic printed on it in large 
friendly letters. The other reason was that this device was in fact that 
most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing 
corporations of Ursa Minor - The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
The reason why it was published in the form of a micro sub meson 



electronic component is that if it were printed in normal book form, 
an interstellar hitch hiker would require several inconveniently large 
buildings to carry it around in. 

Beneath that in Ford Prefect's satchel were a few biros, a notepad, 
and a largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the 
subject of towels. 

A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an 
interstellar hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical value - 
you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold 
moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded 
beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can 
sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert 
world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river 
Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your 
head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous 
Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes 
that if you can't see it, it can't see you - daft as a bush, but very 
ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress 
signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean 
enough. 

More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For 
some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch 
hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is 
also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, 
flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, 
space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the 
hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker 
might accidentally have "lost". What the strag will think is that any 
man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, 
slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows 
where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with. 

Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in "Hey, 
you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who really knows 
where his towel is." (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; 
hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy.) 



Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect's satchel, the 
Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic began to wink more quickly. Miles above the 
surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out. At 
Jodrell Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of 
tea. 

"You got a towel with you?" said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur. 

Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him. 

"Why? What, no... should I have?" Fie had given up being surprised, 
there didn't seem to be any point any longer. 

Ford clicked his tongue in irritation. 

"Drink up," he urged. 

At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside 
filtered through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of the 
jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping over 
the whisky Ford had eventually bought him. 

Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet. 

"What's that?" he yelped. 

"Don't worry," said Ford, "they haven't started yet." 

"Thank God for that," said Arthur and relaxed. 

"It's probably just your house being knocked down," said Ford, 
drowning his last pint. 

"What?" shouted Arthur. Suddenly Ford's spell was broken. Arthur 
looked wildly around him and ran to the window. 

"My God they are! They're knocking my house down. What the hell 
am I doing in the pub, Ford?" 

"It hardly makes any difference at this stage," said Ford, "let them 
have their fun." 

"Fun?" yelped Arthur. "Fun!" Fie quickly checked out of the window 
again that they were talking about the same thing. 

"Damn their fun!" he hooted and ran out of the pub furiously 
waving a nearly empty beer glass. Fie made no friends at all in the pub 
that lunchtime. 

"Stop, you vandals! You home wreckers!" bawled Arthur. "You half 
crazed Visigoths, stop will you!" 



Ford would have to go after him. Turning quickly to the barman he 
asked for four packets of peanuts. 

"There you are sir," said the barman, slapping the packets on the 
bar, "twenty-eight pence if you'd be so kind." 

Ford was very kind - he gave the barman another five-pound note 
and told him to keep the change. The barman looked at it and then 
looked at Ford. Fie suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary 
sensation that he didn't understand because no one on Earth had 
ever experienced it before. In moments of great stress, every life form 
that exists gives out a tiny sublimal signal. This signal simply 
communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that 
being is from the place of his birth. On Earth it is never possible to be 
further than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really 
isn't very far, so such signals are too minute to be noticed. Ford 
Prefect was at this moment under great stress, and he was born 600 
light years away in the near vicinity of Betelgeuse. 

The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, 
incomprehensible sense of distance. Fie didn't know what it meant, 
but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost 
awe. 

"Are you serious, sir?" he said in a small whisper which had the 
effect of silencing the pub. "You think the world's going to end?" 

"Yes," said Ford. 

"But, this afternoon?" 

Ford had recovered himself. Fie was at his flippest. 

"Yes," he said gaily, "in less than two minutes I would estimate." 

The barman couldn't believe the conversation he was having, but 
he couldn't believe the sensation he had just had either. 

"Isn't there anything we can do about it then?" he said. 

"No, nothing," said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pockets. 

Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how 
stupid everyone had become. 

The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now. Flis eyes 
waved their way up to Ford. 

"I thought," he said, "that if the world was going to end we were 
meant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something." 



"If you like, yes," said Ford. 

"That's what they told us in the army," said the man, and his eyes 
began the long trek back down to his whisky. 

"Will that help?" asked the barman. 

"No," said Ford and gave him a friendly smile. "Excuse me," he said, 
"I've got to go." With a wave, he left. 

The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly 
enough, the man with the raucous laugh did it again. The girl he had 
dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly 
over the last hour or so, and it would probably have been a great 
satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half or so he would 
suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon 
monoxide. Flowever, when the moment came she would be too busy 
evaporating herself to notice it. 

The barman cleared his throat. Fie heard himself say: 

"Last orders, please." 

The huge yellow machines began to sink downward and to move 
faster. 

Ford knew they were there. This wasn't the way he had wanted it. 

Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house. Fie 
didn't notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didn't notice the 
wind, he didn't notice the sudden irrational squall of rain. Fie didn't 
notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling over the rubble 
that had been his home. 

"You barbarians!" he yelled. "I'll sue the council for every penny it's 
got! I'll have you hung, drawn and quartered! And whipped! And 
boiled... until... until... until you've had enough." 

Ford was running after him very fast. Very very fast. 

"And then I'll do it again!" yelled Arthur. "And when I've finished I 
will take all the little bits, and I will jump on them!" 

Arthur didn't notice that the men were running from the bulldozers; 
he didn't notice that Mr. Prosser was staring hectically into the sky. 
What Mr. Prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were 
screaming through the clouds. Impossibly huge yellow somethings. 



"And I will carry on jumping on them," yelled Arthur, still running, 
"until I get blisters, or I can think of anything even more unpleasant to 
do, and then..." 

Arthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on his back. 
At last he noticed that something was going on. His finger shot 
upwards. 

"What the hell's that?" he shrieked. 

Whatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness, tore 
the sky apart with mind-buggering noise and leapt off into the 
distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang that 
drove your ears six feet into your skull. 

Another one followed and did the same thing only louder. 

It's difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the 
planet were doing now, because they didn't really know what they 
were doing themselves. None of it made a lot of sense - running into 
houses, running out of houses, howling noiselessly at the noise. All 
around the world city streets exploded with people, cars slewed into 
each other as the noise fell on them and then rolled off like a tidal 
wave over hills and valleys, deserts and oceans, seeming to flatten 
everything it hit. 

Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible 
sadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears. He knew exactly 
what was happening and had known ever since his Sub-Etha Sens-O- 
Matic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillar and 
woken him with a start. It was what he had waited for all these years, 
but when he had deciphered the signal pattern sitting alone in his 
small dark room a coldness had gripped him and squeezed his heart. 

Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who could have come and said a 
big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn't it just have to be the 
Vogons. 

Still he knew what he had to do. As the Vogon craft screamed 
through the air high above him he opened his satchel. He threw away 
a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he threw 
away a copy of Godspell: He wouldn't need them where he was going. 
Everything was ready, everything was prepared. 

He knew where his towel was. 



A sudden silence hit the Earth. If anything it was worse than the 
noise. For a while nothing happened. 

The great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation on 
Earth. Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a 
blasphemy against nature. Many people went straight into shock as 
their minds tried to encompass what they were looking at. The ships 
hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't. 

And still nothing happened. 

Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of 
open ambient sound. Every hi-fi set in the world, every radio, every 
television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every tweeter, 
every mid-range driver in the world quietly turned itself on. 

Every tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every wine 
glass, every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically 
perfect sounding board. 

Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the very 
ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public address system 
ever built. But there was no concert, no music, no fanfare, just a 
simple message. 

"People of Earth, your attention please," a voice said, and it was 
wonderful. Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion 
levels so low as to make a brave man weep. 

"This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning 
Council," the voice continued. "As you will no doubt be aware, the 
plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require 
the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system, 
and regrettably your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. 
The process will take slightly less that two of your Earth minutes. 
Thank you." 

The PA died away. 

Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth. 
The terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were 
iron fillings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath 
them. Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, but there was 
nowhere to flee to. 

Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again. It said: 



"There's no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning 
charts and demolition orders have been on display in your local 
planning department on Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, 
so you've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it's far 
too late to start making a fuss about it now." 

The PA fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the land. The 
huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power. On the 
underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black space. 

By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio 
transmitter, located a wavelength and broadcasted a message back to 
the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet. Nobody ever heard 
what they said, they only heard the reply. The PA slammed back into 
life again. The voice was annoyed. It said: 

"What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? For 
heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm 
sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs 
that's your own lookout. 

"Energize the demolition beams." 

Light poured out into the hatchways. 

"I don't know," said the voice on the PA, "apathetic bloody planet. 
I've no sympathy at all." It cut off. 

There was a terrible ghastly silence. 

There was a terrible ghastly noise. 

There was a terrible ghastly silence. 

The Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away into the inky starry void. 



Chapter 4 


Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, five hundred 
thousand light years from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox, President 
of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the seas of 
Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and flashing in the 
Damogran sun. 

Damogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost 
totally unheard of. 

Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold. The boat sped on 
across the water. It would be some time before it reached its 
destination because Damogran is such an inconveniently arranged 
planet. It consists of nothing but middling to large desert islands 
separated by very pretty but annoyingly wide stretches of ocean. 

The boat sped on. 

Because of this topological awkwardness Damogran has always 
remained a deserted planet. This is why the Imperial Galactic 
Government chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project, because 
it was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secret. 

The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay 
between the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on 
the whole planet. Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny 
spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely meaningless 
coincidence - in Galacticspeke, easter means small flat and light 
brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by another meaningless 
coincidence was called France. 

One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole 
string of pretty meaningless coincidences. 

But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of 
culmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the 
Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was 
also a great day of culmination for Zaphod Beeblebrox. It was for the 
sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the Presidency, a 



decision which had sent waves of astonishment throughout the 
Imperial Galaxy. Zaphod Beeblebrox? President? Not the Zaphod 
Beeblebrox? Not the President? Many had seen it as a clinching proof 
that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas. 

Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex-hippy, good timer, (crook? 
quite possibly), manic self-publicist, terribly bad at personal 
relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch. 

President? 

No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least. 

Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on 
which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod 
Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was 
more or less a fait accompli: he was the ideal Presidency fodderl. 

What they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was 
doing it. 

He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun. 

Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize 
what Zaphod had been up to. Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox's 
Presidency was all about. Today was also his two hundredth birthday, 
but that was just another meaningless coincidence. 

As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled 
quietly to himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to 
be. He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across the seat back. He 
steered with an extra arm he'd recently fitted just beneath his right 
one to help improve his ski-boxing. 

"Hey," he cooed to himself, "you're a real cool boy you." But his 
nerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistle. 

The island of France was about twenty miles long, five miles across 
the middle, sandy and crescent shaped. In fact it seemed to exist not 
so much as an island in its own right as simply a means of defining the 
sweep and curve of a huge bay. This impression was heightened by 
the fact that the inner coastline of the crescent consisted almost 
entirely of steep cliffs. From the top of the cliff the land sloped slowly 
down five miles to the opposite shore. 

On top of the cliffs stood a reception committee. 



It consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had 
built the Heart of Gold - mostly humanoid, but here and there were a 
few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green slyph-like 
maximegalacticans, an octopoid physucturalist or two and a 
Hooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a super-intelligent shade of the color blue). 
All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multi-colored 
ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily refracted 
into a free standing prism for the occasion. 

There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of 
them. Together and between them they had gone to and beyond the 
furthest limits of physical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of 
matter, strained, twisted and broken the laws of possibility and 
impossibility, but still the greatest excitement of all seemed to be to 
meet a man with an orange sash round his neck. (An orange sash was 
what the President of the Galaxy traditionally wore.) It might not even 
have made much difference to them if they'd known exactly how 
much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. 
Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic 
President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from 
it. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job. 

The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seemanship, as the 
Presidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay. It 
flashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide skidding 
turns. 

In fact it didn't need to touch the water at all, because it was 
supported on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms - but just for effect it 
was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered into the water. 
They slashed sheets of water hissing into the air, carved deep gashes 
into the sea which swayed crazily and sank back foaming into the 
boat's wake as it careered across the bay. 

Zaphod loved effect: it was what he was best at. 

He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild 
scything skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightly on the 
rocking waves. 

Within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at 
over three billion people. The three billion people weren't actually 
there, but they watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small 



robot tri-D camera which hovered obsequiously in the air nearby. The 
antics of the President always made amazingly popular tri-D; that's 
what they were for. 

He grinned again. Three billion and six people didn't know it, but 
today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for. 

The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of 
his two heads and he waved again. He was roughly humanoid in 
appearance except for the extra head and third arm. His fair tousled 
hair stuck out in random directions, his blue eyes glinted with 
something completely unidentifiable, and his chins were almost 
always unshaven. 

A twenty-foot-high transparent globe floated next to his boat, 
rolling and bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside it floated a 
wide semi-circular sofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more 
the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, 
steady as an upholstered rock. Again, all done for effect as much as 
anything. 

Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the 
sofa. He spread his two arms lazily along the back and with the third 
brushed some dust off his knee. His heads looked about, smiling; he 
put his feet up. At any moment, he thought, he might scream. 

Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted. The 
bubble surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout. Up, 
up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff. Up it surged on the 
jet, the water falling from beneath it, crashing back into the sea 
hundreds of feet below. 

Zaphod smiled, picturing himself. 

A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly 
beautiful one. 

At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on 
to a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and 
riddled to a halt. 

To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the 
bubble, his orange sash blazing in the light. 

The President of the Galaxy had arrived. 

He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hands in 
greeting. 



"Hi," he said. 

A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a 
copy of his prepared speech into his hands. Pages three to seven of 
the original version were at the moment floating soggily on the 
Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay. Pages one and two 
had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had 
already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest 
which the eagle had invented. It was constructed largely of paper and 
it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle to break 
out of it. The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion 
of survival of the species but wanted no truck with it. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he 
gently deflected the one being offered him by the spider. 

"Hi," he said again. 

Everyone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone. He singled 
out Trillian from the crowd. Trillian was a girl that Zaphod had picked 
up recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun, incognito. She was 
slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, 
an odd little nob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes. With her red 
head scarf knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky 
brown dress she looked vaguely Arabic. Not that anyone there had 
ever heard of an Arab of course. The Arabs had very recently ceased 
to exist, and even when they had existed they were five hundred 
thousand light years from Damogran. Trillian wasn't anybody in 
particular, or so Zaphod claimed. She just went around with him 
rather a lot and told him what she thought of him. 

"Hi honey," he said to her. 

She flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away. Then she 
looked back for a moment and smiled more warmly - but by this time 
he was looking at something else. 

"Hi," he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who were 
standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and get on with 
the quotes. He grinned at them particularly because he knew that in a 
few moments he would be giving them one hell of a quote. 

The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them. One of 
the officials of the party had irritably decided that the President was 
clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had 
been written for him, and had flipped the switch on the remote 



control device in his pocket. Away in front of them a huge white dome 
that bulged against the sky cracked down in the middle, split, and 
slowly folded itself down into the ground. Everyone gasped although 
they had known perfectly well it was going to do that because they 
had built it that way. 

Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty 
metres long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white and 
mindboggingly beautiful. At the heart of it, unseen, lay a small gold 
box which carried within it the most brain-wretching device ever 
conceived, a device which made this starship unique in the history of 
the galaxy, a device after which the ship had been named - The Heart 
of Gold. 

"Wow", said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold. There wasn't 
much else he could say. 

He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press. 

"Wow." 

The crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly. He 
winked at Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes at 
him. She knew what he was about to say and thought him a terrible 
showoff. 

"That is really amazing," he said. "That really is truly amazing. That 
is so amazingly amazing I think I'd like to steal it." 

A marvellous Presidential quote, absolutely true to form. The 
crowd laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched 
buttons on their Sub-Etha News-Matics and the President grinned. 

As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the 
small Paralyso-Matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket. 

Finally he could bear it no more. He lifted his heads up to the sky, 
let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to the ground 
and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smiles. 



Chapter 5 


Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other 
Vogons. His highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy 
forehead. His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to 
play the game of Vogon Civil Service politics, and play it well, and 
waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea depths of up 
to a thousand feet with no ill effects. 

Not that he ever went swimming of course. His busy schedule 
would not allow it. He was the way he was because billions of years 
ago when the Vogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval 
seas of Vogsphere, and had lain panting and heaving on the planet's 
virgin shores... when the first rays of the bright young Vogsol sun had 
shone across them that morning, it was as if the forces of evolution 
had simply given up on them there and then, had turned aside in 
disgust and written them off as an ugly and unfortunate mistake. 

They never evolved again; they should never have survived. 

The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick-willed 
slug-brained stubbornness of these creatures. Evolution? they said to 
themselves, Who needs it?, and what nature refused to do for them 
they simply did without until such time as they were able to rectify 
the grosser anatomical inconveniences with surgery. 

Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been 
working overtime to make up for their earlier blunder. They brought 
forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs, which the Vogons ate, 
smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall aspiring trees with 
breathtaking slenderness and colour which the Vogons cut down and 
burned the crab meat with; elegant gazelle-like creatures with silken 
coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons would catch and sit on. They 
were no use as transport because their backs would snap instantly, 
but the Vogons sat on them anyway. 

Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia 
until the Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar 
travel. Within a few short Vog years every last Vogon had migrated to 



the Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the Galaxy and now 
formed the immensely powerful backbone of the Galactic Civil Service. 
They have attempted to acquire learning, they have attempted to 
acquire style and social grace, but in most respects the modern Vogon 
is little different from his primitive forebears. Every year they import 
twenty-seven thousand scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their 
native planet and while away a happy drunken night smashing them 
to bits with iron mallets. 

Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was 
thoroughly vile. Also, he did not like hitchhikers. 

Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of 
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz's flagship, a small match flared nervously. The 
owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and 
was right to be nervous. His name was Ford Prefect2. 

He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange 
monstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering flame, 
but all was quiet. He breathed a silent thank you to the Dentrassis. 

The Dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant 
bunch whom the Vogons had recently taken to employing as catering 
staff on their long haul fleets, on the strict understanding that they 
keep themselves very much to themselves. 

This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money, 
which is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the 
Vogons themselves. The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to see 
was an annoyed Vogon. 

It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect 
was not now a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide. 

He heard a slight groan. By the light of the match he saw a heavy 
shape moving slightly on the floor. Quickly he shook the match out, 
reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for and took it out. 
He crouched on the floor. The shape moved again. 

Ford Prefect said: "I bought some peanuts." 

Arthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently. 

"Here, have some," urged Ford, shaking the packet again, "if you've 
never been through a matter transference beam before you've 



probably lost some salt and protein. The beer you had should have 
cushioned your system a bit." 

"Whhhrrrr..." said Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes. 

"It's dark," he said. 

"Yes," said Ford Prefect, "it's dark." 

"No light," said Arthur Dent. "Dark, no light." 

One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to 
understand about human beings was their habit of continually stating 
and repeating the obvious, as in It's a nice day, or You're very tall, or 
Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you 
alright? At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange 
behaviour. If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he 
thought, their mouths probably seize up. After a few months' 
consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of 
a new one. If they don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their 
brains start working. After a while he abandoned this one as well as 
being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human beings 
after all, but he always remained desperately worried about the 
terrible number of things they didn't know about. 

"Yes," he agreed with Arthur, "no light." He helped Arthur to some 
peanuts. "How do you feel?" he asked. 

"Like a military academy," said Arthur, "bits of me keep on passing 
out." 

Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness. 

"If I asked you where the hell we were," said Arthur weakly, "would 
I regret it?" 

Ford stood up. "We're safe," he said. 

"Oh good," said Arthur. 

"We're in a small galley cabin," said Ford, "in one of the spaceships 
of the Vogon Constructor Fleet." 

"Ah," said Arthur, "this is obviously some strange usage of the word 
safe that I wasn't previously aware of." 

Ford struck another match to help him search for a light switch. 
Monstrous shadows leaped and loomed again. Arthur struggled to his 
feet and hugged himself apprehensively. Hideous alien shapes 
seemed to throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells 



which sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and a low 
irritating hum kept his brain from focusing. 

"How did we get here?" he asked, shivering slightly. 

"We hitched a lift," said Ford. 

"Excuse me?" said Arthur. "Are you trying to tell me that we just 
stuck out our thumbs and some green bug-eyed monster stuck his 
head out and said, Hi fellas, hop right in. I can take you as far as the 
Basingstoke roundabout?" 

"Well," said Ford, "the Thumb's an electronic sub-etha signalling 
device, the roundabout's at Barnard's Star six light years away, but 
otherwise, that's more or less right." 

"And the bug-eyed monster?" 

"Is green, yes." 

"Fine," said Arthur, "when can I get home?" 

"You can't," said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch. 

"Shade your eyes..." he said, and turned it on. 

Even Ford was surprised. 

"Good grief," said Arthur, "is this really the interior of a flying 
saucer?" 

Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the 
control bridge. He always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing 
populated planets. He wished that someone would come and tell him 
that it was all wrong so that he could shout at them and feel better. 
He flopped as heavily as he could on to his control seat in the hope 
that it would break and give him something to be genuinely angry 
about, but it only gave a complaining sort of creak. 

"Go away!" he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the 
bridge at that moment. The guard vanished immediately, feeling 
rather relieved. He was glad it wouldn't now be him who delivered 
the report they'd just received. The report was an official release 
which said that a wonderful new form of spaceship drive was at this 
moment being unveiled at a government research base on Damogran 
which would henceforth make all hyperspatial express routes 
unnecessary. 



Another door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn't 
shout because it was the door from the galley quarters where the 
Dentrassis prepared his meals. A meal would be most welcome. 

A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch 
tray. It was grinning like a maniac. 

Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted. He knew that when a 
Dentrassi looked that pleased with itself there was something going 
on somewhere on the ship that he could get very angry indeed about. 

Ford and Arthur stared about them. 

"Well, what do you think?" said Ford. 

"It's a bit squalid, isn't it?" 

Ford frowned at the grubby mattress, unwashed cups and 
unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around the 
cramped cabin. 

"Well, this is a working ship, you see," said Ford. "These are the 
Dentrassi sleeping quarters." 

"I thought you said they were called Vogons or something." 

"Yes," said Ford, "the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are the 
cooks, they let us on board." 

"I'm confused," said Arthur. 

"Here, have a look at this," said Ford. He sat down on one of the 
mattresses and rummaged about in his satchel. Arthur prodded the 
mattress nervously and then sat on it himself: in fact he had very little 
to be nervous about, because all mattresses grown in the swamps of 
Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed and dried before being 
put to service. Very few have ever come to life again. 

Ford handed the book to Arthur. 

"What is it?" asked Arthur. 

"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's a sort of electronic book. 
It tells you everything you need to know about anything. That's its 
job." 

Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands. 

"I like the cover," he said. "Don't Panic. It's the first helpful or 
intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day." 



"I'll show you how it works," said Ford. He snatched it from Arthur 
who was still holding it as if it was a two-week-dead lark and pulled it 
out of its cover. 

"You press this button here you see and the screen lights up giving 
you the index." 

A screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began to 
flicker across the surface. 

"You want to know about Vogons, so I enter that name so." His 
fingers tapped some more keys. "And there we are." 

The words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the 
screen. 

Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and 
words began to undulate across it. At the same time, the book began 
to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voice. This is what 
the book said. 

"Vogon Constructor Fleets. Here is what to do if you want to get a 
lift from a Vogon: forget it. They are one of the most unpleasant races 
in the Galaxy - not actually evil, but bad tempered, bureaucratic, 
officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their 
own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal 
without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, 
found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft 
peat and recycled as firelighters." 

"The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger 
down his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to feed his 
grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal." 

"On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you." 

Arthur blinked at it. 

"What a strange book. How did we get a lift then?" 

"That's the point, it's out of date now," said Ford, sliding the book 
back into its cover. "I'm doing the field research for the New Revised 
Edition, and one of the things I'll have to include is a bit about how 
the Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks which gives us a rather 
useful little loophole." 

A pained expression crossed Arthur's face. "But who are the 
Dentrassi?" he said. 



"Great guys," said Ford. "They're the best cooks and the best drink 
mixers and they don't give a wet slap about anything else. And they'll 
always help hitchhikers aboard, partly because they like the company, 
but mostly because it annoys the Vogons. Which is exactly the sort of 
thing you need to know if you're an impoverished hitch hiker trying to 
see the marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altai ran Dollars a 
day. And that's my job. Fun, isn't it?" 

Arthur looked lost. 

"It's amazing," he said and frowned at one of the other mattresses. 

"Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I 
intended," said Ford. "I came for a week and got stuck for fifteen 
years." 

"But how did you get there in the first place then?" 

"Easy, I got a lift with a teaser." 

"A teaser?" 

"Yeah." 

"Er, what is..." 

"A teaser? Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do. They 
cruise around looking for planets which haven't made interstellar 
contact yet and buzz them." 

"Buzz them?" Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making 
life difficult for him. 

"Yeah", said Ford, "they buzz them. They find some isolated spot 
with very few people around, then land right by some poor soul 
whom no one's ever going to believe and then strut up and down in 
front of him wearing silly antennae on their heads and making beep 
beep noises. Rather childish really." Ford leant back on the mattress 
with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly pleased with 
himself. 

"Ford," insisted Arthur, "I don't know if this sounds like a silly 
question, but what am I doing here?" 

"Well you know that," said Ford. "I rescued you from the Earth." 

"And what's happened to the Earth?" 

"Ah. It's been demolished." 

"Flas it," said Arthur levelly. 

"Yes. It just boiled away into space." 



"Look," said Arthur, "I'm a bit upset about that." 

Ford frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around his 
mind. 

"Yes, I can understand that," he said at last. 

"Understand that!" shouted Arthur. "Understand that!" 

Ford sprang up. 

"Keep looking at the book!" he hissed urgently. 

"What?" 

"Don't Panic." 

"I'm not panicking!" 

"Yes you are." 

"Alright so I'm panicking, what else is there to do?" 

"You just come along with me and have a good time. The Galaxy's a 
fun place. You'll need to have this fish in your ear." 

"I beg your pardon?" asked Arthur, rather politely he thought. 

Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a small 
yellow fish wriggling around in it. Arthur blinked at him. Fie wished 
there was something simple and recognizable he could grasp hold of. 
Fie would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassi underwear, the 
piles of Squornshellous mattresses and the man from Betelgeuse 
holding up a small yellow fish and offering to put it in his ear he had 
been able to see just a small packet of corn flakes. Fie couldn't, and he 
didn't feel safe. 

Suddenly a violent noise leapt at them from no source that he 
could identify. Fie gasped in terror at what sounded like a man trying 
to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolves. 

"Shush!" said Ford. "Listen, it might be important." 

"Im... important?" 

"It's the Vogon captain making an announcement on the T'annoy." 

"You mean that's how the Vogons talk?" 

"Listen!" 

"But I can't speak Vogon!" 

"You don't need to. Just put that fish in your ear." 

Ford, with a lightning movement, clapped his hand to Arthur's ear, 
and he had the sudden sickening sensation of the fish slithering deep 



into his aural tract. Gasping with horror he scrabbled at his ear for a 
second or so, but then slowly turned goggle-eyed with wonder. He 
was experiencing the aural equivalent of looking at a picture of two 
black silhouetted faces and suddenly seeing it as a picture of a white 
candlestick. Or of looking at a lot of coloured dots on a piece of paper 
which suddenly resolve themselves into the figure six and mean that 
your optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a new pair of 
glasses. 

He was still listening to the howling gargles, he knew that, only 
now it had taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforward 
English. 

This is what he heard... 



Chapter 6 


"Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle 
howl howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh 
should have a good time. Message repeats. This is your captain 
speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay attention. First of all 
I see from our instruments that we have a couple of hitchhikers 
aboard. Hello wherever you are. I just want to make it totally clear 
that you are not at all welcome. I worked hard to get where I am 
today, and I didn't become captain of a Vogon constructor ship simply 
so I could turn it into a taxi service for a load of degenerate 
freeloaders. I have sent out a search party, and as soon that they find 
you I will put you off the ship. If you're very lucky I might read you 
some of my poetry first." 

"Secondly, we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey to 
Barnard's Star. On arrival we will stay in dock for a seventy-two hour 
refit, and no one's to leave the ship during that time. I repeat, all 
planet leave is cancelled. I've just had an unhappy love affair, so I 
don't see why anybody else should have a good time. Message ends." 

The noise stopped. 

Arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled 
up in a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round his head. 
He smiled weakly. 

"Charming man," he said. "I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid 
her to marry one..." 

"You wouldn't need to," said Ford. "They've got as much sex appeal 
as a road accident. No, don't move," he added as Arthur began to 
uncurl himself, "you'd better be prepared for the jump into 
hyperspace. It's unpleasantly like being drunk." 

"What's so unpleasant about being drunk?" 

"You ask a glass of water." 

Arthur thought about this. 

"Ford," he said. 



"Yeah?" 

"What's this fish doing in my ear?" 

"It's translating for you. It's a Babel fish. Look it up in the book if 
you like." 

He tossed over The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and then 
curled himself up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for the jump. 

At that moment the bottom fell out of Arthur's mind. 

His eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the top of 
his head. 

The room folded flat about him, spun around, shifted out of 
existence and left him sliding into his own navel. 

They were passing through hyperspace. 

"The Babel fish," said The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy quietly, 
"is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the 
Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy not from its carrier but from 
those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from 
this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the 
mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the 
conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the 
speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical 
upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can 
instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. 

The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix 
which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish." 

"Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so 
mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some 
thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the 
non-existence of God." 

"The argument goes something like this: 'I refuse to prove that I 
exist,' says God, 'for proof denies faith, and without faith I am 
nothing.'" 

"'But,' says Man, 'The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could 
not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by 
your own arguments, you don't. QED.'" 

"'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly 
vanished in a puff of logic." 



"'Oh, that was easy,' says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove 
that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing." 

"Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of 
dingo's kidneys, but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid making a small 
fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best-selling book 
Well That About Wraps It Up For God." 

"Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all 
barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has 
caused more and bloddier wars than anything else in the history of 
creation." 

Arthur let out a low groan. He was horrified to discover that the 
kick through hyperspace hadn't killed him. He was now six light years 
from the place that the Earth would have been if it still existed. 

The Earth. 

Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind. There 
was no way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole Earth 
having gone, it was too big. He prodded his feelings by thinking that 
his parents and his sister had gone. No reaction. He thought of all the 
people he had been close to. No reaction. Then he thought of a 
complete stranger he had been standing behind in the queue at the 
supermarket before and felt a sudden stab - the supermarket was 
gone, everything in it was gone. Nelson's Column had gone! Nelson's 
Column had gone and there would be no outcry, because there was 
no one left to make an outcry. From now on Nelson's Column only 
existed in his mind. England only existed in his mind - his mind, stuck 
here in this dank smelly steel-lined spaceship. A wave of 
claustrophobia closed in on him. 

England no longer existed. He'd got that - somehow he'd got it. He 
tried again. America, he thought, has gone. He couldn't grasp it. He 
decided to start smaller again. New York has gone. No reaction. He'd 
never seriously believed it existed anyway. The dollar, he thought, 
had sunk for ever. Slight tremor there. Every Bogart movie has been 
wiped, he said to himself, and that gave him a nasty knock. 
McDonalds, he thought. There is no longer any such thing as a 
McDonald's hamburger. 

He passed out. When he came round a second later he found he 
was sobbing for his mother. 

He jerked himself violently to his feet. 



"Ford!" 

Ford looked up from where he was sitting in a corner humming to 
himself. Fie always found the actual travelling-through-space part of 
space travel rather trying. 

"Yeah?" he said. 

"If you're a researcher on this book thing and you were on Earth, 
you must have been gathering material on it." 

"Well, I was able to extend the original entry a bit, yes." 

"Let me see what it says in this edition then. I've got to see it." 

"Yeah OK." FHe passed it over again. 

Arthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking. FHe 
pressed the entry for the relevant page. The screen flashed and 
swirled and resolved into a page of print. Arthur stared at it. 

"It doesn't have an entry!" he burst out. 

Ford looked over his shoulder. 

"Yes it does," he said, "down there, see at the bottom of the screen, 
just under Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple-breasted whore of 
Eroticon 6." 

Arthur followed Ford's finger, and saw where it was pointing. For a 
moment it still didn't register, then his mind nearly blew up. 

"What? Flarmless? Is that all it's got to say? Flarmless! One word!" 

Ford shrugged. 

"Well, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy, and only a 
limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors," he said, "and 
no one knew much about the Earth of course." 

"Well for God's sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bit." 

"Oh yes, well I managed to transmit a new entry off to the editor. 

FHe had to trim it a bit, but it's still an improvement." 

"And what does it say now?" asked Arthur. 

"Mostly harmless," admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed 
cough. 

"Mostly harmless!" shouted Arthur. 

"What was that noise?" hissed Ford. 

"It was me shouting," shouted Arthur. 

"No! Shut up!" said Ford. I think we're in trouble." 



"You think we're in trouble!" 

Outside the door were the sounds of marching feet. 

"The Dentrassi?" whispered Arthur. 

"No, those are steel tipped boots," said Ford. 

There was a sharp ringing rap on the door. 

"Then who is it?" said Arthur. 

"Well," said Ford, "if we're lucky it's just the Vogons come to throw 
us in to space." 

"And if we're unlucky?" 

"If we're unlucky," said Ford grimly, "the captain might be serious 
in his threat that he's going to read us some of his poetry first..." 



Chapter 7 


Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe. 

The second worst is that of the Azagoths of Kria. During a recitation 
by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode To A 
Small Lump of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit One Midsummer 
Morning" four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging, and 
the President of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by 
gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos is reported to have been 
"disappointed" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on 
a reading of his twelve-book epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime 
Gurgles when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save 
life and civilization, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled 
his brain. 

The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator Paula 
Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex, England in the 
destruction of the planet Earth. 

Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done not so 
much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence 
of muscle movements. Fie had had a terribly therapeutic yell at his 
prisoners and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for a little 
callousness. 

The prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation Chairs - strapped in. 
Vogons suffered no illusions as to the regard their works were 
generally held in. Their early attempts at composition had been part 
of bludgeoning insistence that they be accepted as a properly evolved 
and cultured race, but now the only thing that kept them going was 
sheer bloodymindedness. 

The sweat stood out cold on Ford Prefect's brow, and slid round 
the electrodes strapped to his temples. These were attached to a 
battery of electronic equipment - imagery intensifiers, rhythmic 
modulators, alliterative residulators and simile dumpers - all designed 



to heighten the experience of the poem and make sure that not a 
single nuance of the poet's thought was lost. 

Arthur Dent sat and quivered. He had no idea what he was in for, 
but he knew that he hadn't liked anything that had happened so far 
and didn't think things were likely to change. 

The Vogon began to read - a fetid little passage of his own devising. 

"Oh frettled gruntbuggly..." he began. Spasms wracked Ford's body 
- this was worse than ever he'd been prepared for. 

"?... thy micturations are to me | As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a 
lurgid bee." 

"Aaaaaaarggggghhhhhh!" went Ford Prefect, wrenching his head 
back as lumps of pain thumped through it. He could dimly see beside 
him Arthur lolling and rolling in his seat. He clenched his teeth. 

"Groop I implore thee," continued the merciless Vogon, "my 
foonting turlingdromes." 

His voice was rising to a horrible pitch of impassioned stridency. 
"And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles, | Or I will 
rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I 
don't!" 

"Nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh!" cried Ford 
Prefect and threw one final spasm as the electronic enhancement of 
the last line caught him full blast across the temples. He went limp. 

Arthur lolled. 

"Now Earthlings..." whirred the Vogon (he didn't know that Ford 
Prefect was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, 
and wouldn't have cared if he had) "I present you with a simple choice! 
Either die in the vacuum of space, or..." he paused for melodramatic 
effect, "tell me how good you thought my poem was!" 

He threw himself backwards into a huge leathery bat-shaped seat 
and watched them. He did the smile again. 

Ford was rasping for breath. He rolled his dusty tongue round his 
parched mouth and moaned. 

Arthur said brightly: "Actually I quite liked it." 

Ford turned and gaped. Here was an approach that had quite 
simply not occurred to him. 



The Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that effectively obscured his 
nose and was therefore no bad thing. 

"Oh good..." he whirred, in considerable astonishment. 

"Oh yes," said Arthur, "I thought that some of the metaphysical 
imagery was really particularly effective." 

Ford continued to stare at him, slowly organizing his thoughts 
around this totally new concept. Were they really going to be able to 
bareface their way out of this? 

"Yes, do continue..." invited the Vogon. 

"Oh... and er... interesting rhythmic devices too," continued Arthur, 
"which seemed to counterpoint the... er... er..." He floundered. 

Ford leaped to his rescue, hazarding "counterpoint the surrealism 
of the underlying metaphor of the... er..." He floundered too, but 
Arthur was ready again. 

"... humanity of the..." 

"Vogonity," Ford hissed at him. 

"Ah yes, Vogonity (sorry) of the poet's compassionate soul," Arthur 
felt he was on a home stretch now, "which contrives through the 
medium of the verse structure to sublimate this, transcend that, and 
come to terms with the fundamental dichotomies of the other," (he 
was reaching a triumphant crescendo...) "and one is left with a 
profound and vivid insight into... into... er..." (... which suddenly gave 
out on him.) Ford leaped in with the coup de grace: 

"Into whatever it was the poem was about!" he yelled. Out of the 
corner of his mouth: "Well done, Arthur, that was very good." 

The Vogon perused them. For a moment his embittered racial soul 
had been touched, but he thought no - too little too late. His voice 
took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylon. 

"So what you're saying is that I write poetry because underneath 
my mean callous heartless exterior I really just want to be loved," he 
said. He paused. "Is that right?" 

Ford laughed a nervous laugh. "Well I mean yes," he said, "don't 
we all, deep down, you know... er..." 

The Vogon stood up. 

"No, well you're completely wrong," he said, "I just write poetry to 
throw my mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief. I'm going 



to throw you off the ship anyway. Guard! Take the prisoners to 
number three airlock and throw them out!" 

"What?" shouted Ford. 

A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out 
of their straps with his huge blubbery arms. 

"You can't throw us into space," yelled Ford, "we're trying to write 
a book." 

"Resistance is useless!" shouted the Vogon guard back at him. It 
was the first phrase he'd learnt when he joined the Vogon Guard 
Corps. 

The captain watched with detached amusement and then turned 
away. 

Arthur stared round him wildly. 

"I don't want to die now!" he yelled. "I've still got a headache! I 
don't want to go to heaven with a headache, I'd be all cross and 
wouldn't enjoy it!" 

The guard grasped them both firmly round the neck, and bowing 
deferentially towards his captain's back, hoiked them both protesting 
out of the bridge. A steel door closed and the captain was on his own 
again. Fie hummed quietly and mused to himself, lightly fingering his 
notebook of verses. 

"Hmmmm," he said, "counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying 
metaphor..." Fie considered this for a moment, and then closed the 
book with a grim smile. 

"Death's too good for them," he said. 

The long steel-lined corridor echoed to the feeble struggles of the 
two humanoids clamped firmly under rubbery Vogon armpits. 

"This is great," spluttered Arthur, "this is really terrific. Let go of me 
you brute!" 

The Vogon guard dragged them on. 

"Don't you worry," said Ford, "I'll think of something." Fie didn't 
sound hopeful. 

"Resistance is useless!" bellowed the guard. 

"Just don't say things like that," stammered Ford. "Flow can anyone 
maintain a positive mental attitude if you're saying things like that?" 



"My God," complained Arthur, "you're talking about a positive 
mental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished 
today. I woke up this morning and thought I'd have a nice relaxed day, 
do a bit of reading, brush the dog... It's now just after four in the 
afternoon and I'm already thrown out of an alien spaceship six light 
years from the smoking remains of the Earth!" He spluttered and 
gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip. 

"Alright," said Ford, "just stop panicking." 

"Who said anything about panicking?" snapped Arthur. "This is still 
just the culture shock. You wait till I've settled down into the situation 
and found my bearings. Then I'll start panicking." 

"Arthur you're getting hysterical. Shut up!" Ford tried desperately 
to think, but was interrupted by the guard shouting again. 

"Resistance is useless!" 

"And you can shut up as well!" snapped Ford. 

"Resistance is useless!" 

"Oh give it a rest," said Ford. He twisted his head till he was looking 
straight up into his captor's face. A thought struck him. 

"Do you really enjoy this sort of thing?" he asked suddenly. 

The Vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped 
slowly over his face. 

"Enjoy?" he boomed. "What do you mean?" 

"What I mean," said Ford, "is does it give you a full satisfying life? 
Stomping around, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships..." 

The Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows 
almost rolled over each other. His mouth slacked. Finally he said, 

"Well the hours are good..." 

"They'd have to be," agreed Ford. 

Arthur twisted his head to look at Ford. 

"Ford, what are you doing?" he asked in an amazed whisper. 

"Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK?" he 
said. "So the hours are pretty good then?" he resumed. 

The Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around 
in the murky depths. 

"Yeah," he said, "but now you come to mention it, most of the 
actual minutes are pretty lousy. Except..." he thought again, which 



required looking at the ceiling - "except some of the shouting I quite 
like." He filled his lungs and bellowed, "Resistance is..." 

"Sure, yes," interrupted Ford hurriedly, "you're good at that, I can 
tell. But if it's mostly lousy," he said, slowly giving the words time to 
reach their mark, "then why do you do it? What is it? The girls? The 
leather? The machismo? Or do you just find that coming to terms 
with the mindless tedium of it all presents an interesting challenge?" 

"Er..." said the guard, "er... er... I dunno. I think I just sort of... do it 
really. My aunt said that spaceship guard was a good career for a 
young Vogon - you know, the uniform, the low-slung stun ray holster, 
the mindless tedium..." 

"There you are Arthur," said Ford with the air of someone reaching 
the conclusion of his argument, "you think you've got problems." 

Arthur rather thought he had. Apart from the unpleasant business 
with his home planet the Vogon guard had half-throttled him already 
and he didn't like the sound of being thrown into space very much. 

"Try and understand his problem," insisted Ford. "Here he is poor 
lad, his entire life's work is stamping around, throwing people off 
spaceships..." 

"And shouting," added the guard. 

"And shouting, sure," said Ford patting the blubbery arm clamped 
round his neck in friendly condescension,"... and he doesn't even 
know why he's doing it!" 

Arthur agreed this was very sad. He did this with a small feeble 
gesture, because he was too asphyxicated to speak. 

Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard. 

"Well. Now you put it like that I suppose..." 

"Good lad!" encouraged Ford. 

"But alright," went on the rumblings, "so what's the alternative?" 

"Well," said Ford, brightly but slowly, "stop doing it of course! Tell 
them," he went on, "you're not going to do it anymore." He felt he 
had to add something to that, but for the moment the guard seemed 
to have his mind occupied pondering that much. 

"Eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..." said the guard, 
"erm, well that doesn't sound that great to me." 

Ford suddenly felt the moment slipping away. 



"Now wait a minute," he said, "that's just the start you see, there's 
more to it than that you see..." 

But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his 
original purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock. He was 
obviously quite touched. 

"No, I think if it's all the same to you," he said, "I'd better get you 
both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other 
bits of shouting I've got to do." 

It wasn't all the same to Ford Prefect after all. 

"Come on now... but look!" he said, less slowly, less brightly. 

"Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn..." said Arthur without any clear 
inflection. 

"But hang on," pursued Ford, "there's music and art and things to 
tell you about yet! Arrrggghhh!" 

"Resistance is useless," bellowed the guard, and then added, "You 
see if I keep it up I can eventually get promoted to Senior Shouting 
Officer, and there aren't usually many vacancies for non-shouting and 
non-pushing-people-about officers, so I think I'd better stick to what I 
know." 

They had now reached the airlock - a large circular steel hatchway 
of massive strength and weight let into the inner skin of the craft. The 
guard operated a control and the hatchway swung smoothly open. 

"But thanks for taking an interest," said the Vogon guard. "Bye 
now." He flung Ford and Arthur through the hatchway into the small 
chamber within. Arthur lay panting for breath. Ford scrambled round 
and flung his shoulder uselessly against the reclosing hatchway. 

"But listen," he shouted to the guard, "there's a whole world you 
don't know anything about... here how about this?" Desperately he 
grabbed for the only bit of culture he knew offhand - he hummed the 
first bar of Beethoven's Fifth. 

"Da da da dum! Doesn't that stir anything in you?" 

"No," said the guard, "not really. But I'll mention it to my aunt." 

If he said anything further after that it was lost. The hatchway 
sealed itself tight, and all sound was lost but the faint distant hum of 
the ship's engines. 

They were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six feet 
in diameter and ten feet long. 



"Potentially bright lad I thought," he said and slumped against the 
curved wall. 

Arthur was still lying in the curve of the floor where he had fallen. 
He didn't look up. He just lay panting. 

"We're trapped now aren't we?" 

"Yes," said Ford, "we're trapped." 

"Well didn't you think of anything? I thought you said you were 
going to think of something. Perhaps you thought of something and 
didn't notice." 

"Oh yes, I thought of something," panted Ford. Arthur looked up 
expectantly. 

"But unfortunately," continued Ford, "it rather involved being on 
the other side of this airtight hatchway." He kicked the hatch they'd 
just been through. 

"But it was a good idea was it?" 

"Oh yes, very neat." 

"What was it?" 

"Well I hadn't worked out the details yet. Not much point now is 
there?" 

"So... er, what happens next?" 

"Oh, er, well the hatchway in front of us will open automatically in 
a few moments and we will shoot out into deep space I expect and 
asphyxicate. If you take a lungful of air with you you can last for up to 
thirty seconds of course..." said Ford. He stuck his hands behind his 
back, raised his eyebrows and started to hum an old Betelgeusian 
battle hymn. To Arthur's eyes he suddenly looked very alien. 

"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die." 

"Yes," said Ford, "except... no! Wait a minute!" he suddenly lunged 
across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of vision. 
"What's this switch?" he cried. 

"What? Where?" cried Arthur twisting round. 

"No, I was only fooling," said Ford, "we are going to die after all." 

He slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from 
where he left off. 

"You know," said Arthur, "it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in 
a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of 



asphyxication in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my 
mother told me when I was young." 

"Why, what did she tell you?" 

"I don't know, I didn't listen." 

"Oh." Ford carried on humming. 

"This is terrific," Arthur thought to himself, "Nelson's Column has 
gone, McDonald's have gone, all that's left is me and the words 
Mostly Harmless. Any second now all that will be left is Mostly 
Harmless. And yesterday the planet seemed to be going so well." 

A motor whirred. 

A slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air as the outer 
hatchway opened on to an empty blackness studded with tiny 
impossibly bright points of light. Ford and Arthur popped into outer 
space like corks from a toy gun. 



Chapter 8 


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book. It 
has been compiled and recompiled many times over many years and 
under many different editorships. It contains contributions from 
countless numbers of travellers and researchers. 

The introduction begins like this: 

"Space," it says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly 
hugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean you may think it's a long way 
down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. 
Listen..." and so on. 

(After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you 
things you really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously 
beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about the cumulative 
erosion by ten billion visiting tourists a year that any net imbalance 
between the amount you eat and the amount you excrete whilst on 
the planet is surgically removed from your bodyweight when you 
leave: so every time you go to the lavatory it is vitally important to get 
a receipt.) 

To be fair though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of 
distances between the stars, better minds than the one responsible 
for the Guide's introduction have faltered. Some invite you to 
consider for a moment a peanut in reading and a small walnut in 
Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts. 

The simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit into the 
human imagination. 

Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands 
of years to realize that it travels at all, takes time to journey between 
the stars. It takes eight minutes from the star Sol to the place where 
the Earth used to be, and four years more to arrive at Sol's nearest 
stellar neighbour. Alpha Proxima. 



For light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach 
Damogran for instance, takes rather longer: five hundred thousand 
years. 

The record for hitch hiking this distance is just under five years, but 
you don't get to see much on the way. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a lungful 
of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty 
seconds. However it goes on to say that what with space being the 
mind boggling size it is the chances of getting picked up by another 
ship within those thirty seconds are two to the power of two hundred 
and sixty-seven thousand seven hundred and nine to one against. 

By a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone 
number of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to a very good 
party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get off with - 
she went off with a gatecrasher. 

Though the planet Earth, the Islington flat and the telephone have 
all now been demolished, it is comforting to reflect that they are all in 
some small way commemorated by the fact that twenty-nine seconds 
later Ford and Arthur were rescued. 



Chapter 9 


A computer chatted to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock open 
and close itself for no apparent reason. 

This was because Reason was in fact out to lunch. 

A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy. It was exactly a nothingth 
of a second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of 
million light years from end to end. 

As it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it 
and drifted off through the universe. A team of seven three-foot-high 
market analysts fell out of it and died, partly of asphyxication, partly 
of surprise. 

Two hundred and thirty-nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of 
it too, materializing in a large woobly heap on the famine - struck 
land of Poghril in the Pansel system. 

The whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one 
last man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later. 

The nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated 
backwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion. 
Somewhere in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a small 
random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterility of space 
and made them cling together in the most extraordinarily unlikely 
patterns. These patterns quickly learnt to copy themselves (this was 
part of what was so extraordinary of the patterns) and went on to 
cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted on to. That was 
how life began in the Universe. 

Five wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason 
and spewed up a pavement. 

On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like 
half-spent fish. 

"There you are," gasped Ford, scrabbling for a fingerhold on the 
pavement as it raced through the Third Reach of the Unknown, "I told 
you I'd think of something." 



"Oh sure," said Arthur, "sure." 

"Bright idea of mine," said Ford, "to find a passing spaceship and 
get rescued by it." 

The real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them. Various 
pretend ones flitted silently by, like mountain goats. Primal light 
exploded, splattering space-time as with gobbets of junket. Time 
blossomed, matter shrank away. The highest prime number coalesced 
quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever. 

"Oh come off it," said Arthur, "the chances against it were 
astronomical." 

"Don't knock it, it worked," said Ford. 

"What sort of ship are we in?" asked Arthur as the pit of eternity 
yawned beneath them. 

"I don't know," said Ford, "I haven't opened my eyes yet." 

"No, nor have I," said Arthur. 

The Universe jumped, froze, quivered and splayed out in several 
unexpected directions. 

Arthur and Ford opened their eyes and looked about in 
considerable surprise. 

"Good god," said Arthur, "it looks just like the sea front at 
Southend." 

"Hell, I'm relieved to hear you say that," said Ford. 

"Why?" 

"Because I thought I must be going mad." 

"Perhaps you are. Perhaps you only thought I said it." 

Ford thought about this. 

"Well, did you say it or didn't you?" he asked. 

"I think so," said Arthur. 

"Well, perhaps we're both going mad." 

"Yes," said Arthur, "we'd be mad, all things considered, to think this 
was Southend." 

"Well, do you think this is Southend?" 

"Oh yes." 

"So do I." 

"Therefore we must be mad." 



"Nice day for it." 

"Yes," said a passing maniac. 

"Who was that?" asked Arthur 

"Who - the man with the five heads and the elderberry bush full of 
kippers?" 

"Yes." 

"I don't know. Just someone." 

"Ah." 

They both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease 
as huge children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horses 
thundered through the sky taking fresh supplies of reinforced railings 
to the Uncertain Areas. 

"You know," said Arthur with a slight cough, "if this is Southend, 
there's something very odd about it..." 

"You mean the way the sea stays steady and the buildings keep 
washing up and down?" said Ford. "Yes I thought that was odd too. In 
fact," he continued as with a huge bang Southend split itself into six 
equal segments which danced and span giddily round each other in 
lewd and licentious formation, "there is something altogether very 
strange going on." 

Wild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind, 
hot doughnuts popped out of the road for ten pence each, horrid fish 
stormed out of the sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make a run for 
it. 

They plunged through heavy walls of sound, mountains of archaic 
thought, valleys of mood music, bad shoe sessions and footling bats 
and suddenly heard a girl's voice. 

It sounded quite a sensible voice, but it just said, "Two to the 
power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling," and that 
was all. 

Ford skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to find a 
source for the voice but could see nothing he could seriously believe 
in. 

"What was that voice?" shouted Arthur. 

"I don't know," yelled Ford, "I don't know. It sounded like a 
measurement of probability." 



"Probability? What do you mean?" 

"Probability. You know, like two to one, three to one, five to four 
against. It said two to the power of one hundred thousand to one 
against. That's pretty improbable you know." 

A million-gallon vat of custard upended itself over them without 
warning. 

"But what does it mean?" cried Arthur. 

"What, the custard?" 

"No, the measurement of probability!" 

"I don't know. I don't know at all. I think we're on some kind of 
spaceship." 

"I can only assume," said Arthur, "that this is not the first-class 
compartment." 

Bulges appeared in the fabric of space-time. Great ugly bulges. 

"Haaaauuurrgghhh..." said Arthur as he felt his body softening and 
bending in unusual directions. "Southend seems to be melting away... 
the stars are swirling... a dustbowl... my legs are drifting off into the 
sunset... my left arm's come off too." A frightening thought struck him 
"Hell," he said, "how am I going to operate my digital watch now?" He 
wound his eyes desperately around in Ford's direction. 

"Ford," he said, "you're turning into a penguin. Stop it." 

Again came the voice. 

"Two to the power of seventy-five thousand to one against and 
falling." 

Ford waddled around his pond in a furious circle. 

"Hey, who are you," he quacked. "Where are you? What's going on 
and is there any way of stopping it?" 

"Please relax," said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in an 
airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is on fire, 
"you are perfectly safe." 

"But that's not the point!" raged Ford. "The point is that I am now a 
perfectly save penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly running out 
of limbs!" 

"It's alright. I've got them back now," said Arthur. 

"Two to the power of fifty thousand to one against and falling," 
said the voice. 



"Admittedly," said Arthur, "they're longer than I usually like them, 
but..." 

"Isn't there anything," squawked Ford in avian fury, "you feel you 
ought to be telling us?" 

The voice cleared its throat. A giant petit four lolloped off into the 
distance. 

"Welcome," the voice said, "to the Starship Heart of Gold." 

The voice continued. 

"Please do not be alarmed," it said, "by anything you see or hear 
around you. You are bound to feel some initial ill effects as you have 
been rescued from certain death at an improbability level of two to 
the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand to one against - 
possibly much higher. We are now cruising at a level of two to the 
power of twenty-five thousand to one against and falling, and we will 
be restoring normality just as soon as we are sure what is normal 
anyway. Thank you. Two to the power of twenty thousand to one 
against and falling." 

The voice cut out. 

Ford and Arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicle. 

Ford was wildly excited. 

"Arthur!" he said, "this is fantastic! We've been picked up by a ship 
powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive! This is incredible! I heard 
rumors about it before! They were all officially denied, but they must 
have done it! They've built the Improbability Drive! Arthur, this is... 
Arthur? What's happening?" 

Arthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle, trying 
to hold it closed, but it was ill fitting. Tiny furry little hands were 
squeezing themselves through the cracks, their fingers were 
inkstained; tiny voices chattered insanely. 

Arthur looked up. 

"Ford!" he said, "there's an infinite number of monkeys outside 
who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked 
out." 



Chapter 10 


The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of 
crossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, 
without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace. 

It was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a 
governable form of propulsion by the Galactic Government's research 
team on Damogran. 

This, briefly, is the story of its discovery. 

The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by 
simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-Meson 
Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian 
Motion producer (say a nice hot cup of tea) were of course well 
understood - and such generators were often used to break the ice at 
parties by making all the molecules in the hostess's undergarments 
leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the 
Theory of Indeterminacy. 

Many respectable physicists said that they weren't going to stand 
for this - partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly 
because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties. 

Another thing they couldn't stand was the perpetual failure they 
encountered in trying to construct a machine which could generate 
the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship across the 
mind-paralysing distances between the furthest stars, and in the end 
they grumpily announced that such a machine was virtually 
impossible. 

Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab 
after a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this 
way: 

If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, 
then it must logically be a finite improbability. So all I have to do in 
order to make one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed 



that figure into the finite improbability generator, give it a fresh cup 
of really hot tea... and turn it on! 

He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had 
managed to create the long sought after golden Infinite Improbability 
generator out of thin air. 

It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the 
Galactic Institute's Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a 
rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that 
the one thing they really couldn't stand was a smartass. 



Chapter 11 


The Improbability-proof control cabin of the Heart of Gold looked 
like a perfectly conventional spaceship except that it was perfectly 
clean because it was so new. Some of the control seats hadn't had the 
plastic wrapping taken off yet. The cabin was mostly white, oblong, 
and about the size of a smallish restaurant. In fact it wasn't perfectly 
oblong: the two long walls were raked round in a slight parallel curve, 
and all the angles and corners were contoured in excitingly chunky 
shapes. The truth of the matter is that it would have been a great deal 
simpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary three- 
dimensional oblong rom, but then the designers would have got 
miserable. As it was the cabin looked excitingly purposeful, with large 
video screens ranged over the control and guidance system panels on 
the concave wall, and long banks of computers set into the convex 
wall. In one corner a robot sat humped, its gleaming brushed steel 
head hanging loosely between its gleaming brushed steel knees. It too 
was fairly new, but though it was beautifully constructed and polished 
it somehow looked as if the various parts of its more or less humanoid 
body didn't quite fit properly. In fact they fitted perfectly well, but 
something in its bearing suggested that they might have fitted better. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin, 
brushing his hands over pieces of gleaming equipment and giggling 
with excitement. 

Trillian sat hunched over a clump of instruments reading off figures. 
Her voice was carried round the Tannoy system of the whole ship. 

"Five to one against and falling..." she said, "four to one against and 
falling... three to one... two... one... probability factor of one to one... 
we have normality, I repeat we have normality." She turned her 
microphone off - then turned it back on, with a slight smile and 
continued: "Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own 
problem. Please relax. You will be sent for soon." 

Zaphod burst out in annoyance: "Who are they Trillian?" 



Trillian span her seat round to face him and shrugged. 

"Just a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open space," 
she said. "Section ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha." 

"Yeah, well that's a very sweet thought Trillian," complained 
Zaphod, "but do you really think it's wise under the circumstances? I 
mean, here we are on the run and everything, we must have the 
police of half the Galaxy after us by now, and we stop to pick up 
hitchhikers. OK, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million 
for good thinking, yeah?" 

He tapped irritably at a control panel. Trillian quietly moved his 
hand before he tapped anything important. Whatever Zaphod's 
qualities of mind might include - dash, bravado, conceit - he was 
mechanically inept and could easily blow the ship up with an 
extravagant gesture. Trillian had come to suspect that the main 
reason why he had had such a wild and successful life that he never 
really understood the significance of anything he did. 

"Zaphod," she said patiently, "they were floating unprotected in 
open space... you wouldn't want them to have died would you?" 

"Well, you know... no. Not as such, but..." 

"Not as such? Not die as such? But?" Trillian cocked her head on 
one side. 

"Well, maybe someone else might have picked them up later." 

"A second later and they would have been dead." 

"Yeah, so if you'd taken the trouble to think about the problem a 
bit longer it would have gone away." 

"You'd been happy to let them die?" 

"Well, you know, not happy as such, but..." 

"Anyway," said Trillian, turning back to the controls, "I didn't pick 
them up." 

"What do you mean? Who picked them up then?" 

"The ship did." 

"Huh?" 

"The ship did. All by itself." 

"Huh?" 

"Whilst we were in Improbability Drive." 

"But that's incredible." 



"No Zaphod. Just very very improbable." 

"Er, yeah." 

"Look Zaphod," she said, patting his arm, "don't worry about the 
aliens. They're just a couple of guys I expect. I'll send the robot down 
to get them and bring them up here. Hey Marvin!" 

In the corner, the robot's head swung up sharply, but then 
wobbled about imperceptibly. It pulled itself up to its feet as if it was 
about five pounds heavier that it actually was, and made what an 
outside observer would have thought was a heroic effort to cross the 
room. It stopped in front of Trillian and seemed to stare through her 
left shoulder. 

"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said. Its 
voice was low and hopeless. 

"Oh God," muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seat. 

"Well," said Trillian in a bright compassionate tone, "here's 
something to occupy you and keep your mind off things." 

"It won't work," droned Marvin, "I have an exceptionally large 
mind." 

"Marvin!" warned Trillian. 

"Alright," said Marvin, "what do you want me to do?" 

"Go down to number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up 
here under surveillance." 

With a microsecond pause, and a finely calculated 
micromodulation of pitch and timbre - nothing you could actually 
take offence at - Marvin managed to convey his utter contempt and 
horror of all things human. 

"Just that?" he said. 

"Yes," said Trillian firmly. 

"I won't enjoy it," said Marvin. 

Zaphod leaped out of his seat. 

"She's not asking you to enjoy it," he shouted, "just do it will you?" 

"Alright," said Marvin like the tolling of a great cracked bell, "I'll do 
it." 

"Good..." snapped Zaphod, "great... thank you..." 

Marvin turned and lifted his flat-topped triangular red eyes up 
towards him. 



"I'm not getting you down at all am I?" he said pathetically. 

"No no Marvin," lilted Trillian, "that's just fine, really..." 

"I wouldn't like to think that I was getting you down." 

"No, don't worry about that," the lilt continued, "you just act as 
comes naturally and everything will be just fine." 

"You're sure you don't mind?" probed Marvin. 

"No no Marvin," lilted Trillian, "that's just fine, really... just part of 
life." 

"Marvin flashed him an electronic look. 

"Life," said Marvin, "don't talk to me about life." 

He turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself out of the 
cabin. With a satisfied hum and a click the door closed behind him 

"I don't think I can stand that robot much longer Zaphod," growled 
Trillian. 

The Encyclopaedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical 
apparatus designed to do the work of a man. The marketing division 
of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as "Your Plastic 
Pal Who's Fun To Be With." 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the marketing division 
of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as "a bunch of mindless jerks 
who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes," with a 
footnote to the effect that the editors would welcome applications 
from anyone interested in taking over the post of robotics 
correspondent. 

Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopaedia Galactica that 
had the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand 
years in the future defined the marketing division of the Sirius 
Cybernetics Corporation as "a bunch of mindless jerks who were the 
first against the wall when the revolution came." 

The pink cubicle had winked out of existence, the monkeys had 
sunk away to a better dimension. Ford and Arthur found themselves 
in the embarkation area of the ship. It was rather smart. 

"I think the ship's brand new," said Ford. 



"How can you tell?" asked Arthur. "Have you got some exotic 
device for measuring the age of metal?" 

"No, I just found this sales brochure lying on the floor. It's a lot of 
'the Universe can be yours' stuff. Ah! Look, I was right." 

Ford jabbed at one of the pages and showed it to Arthur. 

"It says: 'Sensational new breakthrough in Improbability Physics. As 
soon as the ship's drive reaches Infinite Improbability it passes 
through every point in the Universe. Be the envy of other major 
governments.' Wow, this is big league stuff." 

Ford hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship, 
occasionally gasping with astonishment at what he read - clearly 
Galactic astrotechnology had moved ahead during the years of his 
exile. 

Arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand 
the vast majority of what Ford was saying he began to let his mind 
wander, trailing his fingers along the edge of an incomprehensible 
computer bank, he reached out and pressed an invitingly large red 
button on a nearby panel. The panel lit up with the words Please do 
not press this button again. He shook himself. 

"Listen," said Ford, who was still engrossed in the sales brochure, 
"they make a big thing of the ship's cybernetics. 'A new generation of 
Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robots and computers, with the new 
GPP feature.'" 

"GPP feature?" said Arthur. "What's that?" 

"Oh, it says Genuine People Personalities." 

"Oh," said Arthur, "sounds ghastly." 

A voice behind them said, "It is." The voice was low and hopeless 
and accompanied by a slight clanking sound. They span round and 
saw an abject steel man standing hunched in the doorway. 

"What?" they said. 

"Ghastly," continued Marvin, "it all is. Absolutely ghastly. Just don't 
even talk about it. Look at this door," he said, stepping through it. The 
irony circuits cut into his voice modulator as he mimicked the style of 
the sales brochure. "All the doors in this spaceship have a cheerful 
and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their 
satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done." 



As the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did 
indeed have a satisfied sigh-like quality to it. 
"Hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah!" it said. 

Marvin regarded it with cold loathing whilst his logic circuits 
chattered with disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing 
physical violence against it Further circuits cut in saying, Why bother? 
What's the point? Nothing is worth getting involved in. Further 
circuits amused themselves by analysing the molecular components 
of the door, and of the humanoids' brain cells. For a quick encore they 
measured the level of hydrogen emissions in the surrounding cubic 
parsec of space and then shut down again in boredom. A spasm of 
despair shook the robot's body as he turned. 

"Come on," he droned, "I've been ordered to take you down to the 
bridge. Flere I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take 
you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't." 

Fie turned and walked back to the hated door. 

"Er, excuse me," said Ford following after him, "which government 
owns this ship?" 

Marvin ignored him. 

"You watch this door," he muttered, "it's about to open again. I can 
tell by the intolerable air of smugness it suddenly generates." 

With an ingratiating little whine the door slit open again and 
Marvin stomped through. 

"Come on," he said. 

The others followed quickly and the door slit back into place with 
pleased little clicks and whirrs. 

"Thank you the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics 
Corporation," said Marvin and trudged desolately up the gleaming 
curved corridor that stretched out before them. "Let's build robots 
with Genuine People Personalities," they said. So they tried it out with 
me. I'm a personality prototype. You can tell can't you?" 

Ford and Arthur muttered embarrassed little disclaimers. 

"I hate that door," continued Marvin. "I'm not getting you down at 
all am I?" 

"Which government..." started Ford again. 

"No government owns it," snapped the robot, "it's been stolen." 



"Stolen?" 

"Stolen?" mimicked Marvin. 

"Who by?" asked Ford. 

"Zaphod Beeblebrox." 

Something extraordinary happened to Ford's face. At least five 
entirely separate and distinct expressions of shock and amazement 
piled up on it in a jumbled mess. His left leg, which was in mid stride, 
seemed to have difficulty in finding the floor again. Fie stared at the 
robot and tried to entangle some dartoid muscles. 

"Zaphod Beeblebrox...?" he said weakly. 

"Sorry, did I say something wrong?" said Marvin, dragging himself 
on regardless. "Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I 
don't know why I bother to say it, oh God I'm so depressed. Flere's 
another of those self-satisfied door. Life! Don't talk to me about life." 

"No one ever mentioned it," muttered Arthur irritably. "Ford, are 
you alright?" 

Ford stared at him. "Did that robot say Zaphod Beeblebrox?" he 
said. 



Chapter 12 


A loud clatter of gunk music flooded through the Heart of Gold 
cabin as Zaphod searched the sub-etha radio wavebands for news of 
himself. The machine was rather difficult to operate. For years radios 
had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turning dials; 
then as the technology became more sophisticated the controls were 
made touch-sensitive-you merely had to brush the panels with your 
fingers; now all you had to do was wave your hand in the general 
direction of the components and hope. It saved a lot of muscular 
expenditure of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still 
if you wanted to keep listening to the same programme. 

Zaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again. More gunk 
music, but this time it was a background to a news announcement. 

The news was always heavily edited to fit the rhythms of the music. 

"... and news brought to you here on the sub-etha wave band, 
broadcasting around the galaxy around the clock," squawked a voice, 
"and we'll be saying a big hello to all intelligent life forms 
everywhere... and to everyone else out there, the secret is to bang 
the rocks together, guys. And of course, the big news story tonight is 
the sensational theft of the new Improbability Drive prototype ship by 
none other than Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox. And the 
question everyone's asking is... has the big Z finally flipped? 
Beeblebrox, the man who invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, 
ex-confidence trickster, once described by Eccentrica Gallumbits as 
the Best Bang since the Big One, and recently voted the Worst 
Dressed Sentinent Being in the Known Universe for the seventh time... 
has he got an answer this time? We asked his private brain care 
specialist Gag Halfrunt..." 

The music swirled and dived for a moment. Another voice broke in, 
presumably Halfrunt. He said: "Well, Zaphod's jist zis guy you know?" 
but got no further because an electric pencil flew across the cabin and 
through the radio's on/off sensitive airspace. Zaphod turned and 
glared at Trillian - she had thrown the pencil. 



"Hey," he said, what do you do that for?" 

Trillian was tapping her fingers on a screenful of figures. 

"I've just thought of something," she said. 

"Yeah? Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me for?" 

"You hear enough about yourself as it is." 

"I'm very insecure. We know that." 

"Can we drop your ego for a moment? This is important." 

"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it 
caught and shot now." Zaphod glared at her again, then laughed. 

"Listen," she said, "we picked up those couple of guys..." 

"What couple of guys?" 

"The couple of guys we picked up." 

"Oh, yeah," said Zaphod, "those couple of guys." 

"We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha." 

"Yeah?" said Zaphod and blinked. 

Trillian said quietly, "Does that mean anything to you?" 

"Mmmmm," said Zaphod, "ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha?" 

"Well?" said Trillian. 

"Er... what does the Z mean?" said Zaphod. 

"Which one?" 

"Any one." 

One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship 
with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to 
be stupid just to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid 
because he couldn't be bothered to think and wanted someone else 
to do it for him, pretending to be outrageously stupid to hide the fact 
that he actually didn't understand what was going on, and really being 
genuinely stupid. He was renowned for being amazingly clever and 
quite clearly was so - but not all the time, which obviously worried 
him, hence the act. He proffered people to be puzzled rather than 
contemptuous. This above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely 
stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about it. 

She sighed and punched up a star map on the visiscreen so she 
could make it simple for him, whatever his reasons for wanting it to 
be that way. 



"There," she pointed, "right there." 

"Hey... Yeah!" said Zaphod. 

"Well?" she said. 

"Well what?" 

Parts of the inside of her head screamed at other parts of the 
inside of her head. She said, very calmly, "It's the same sector you 
originally picked me up in." 

He looked at her and then looked back at the screen. 

"Hey, yeah," he said, "now that is wild. We should have zapped 
straight into the middle of the Horsehead Nebula. How did we come 
to be there? I mean that's nowhere." 

She ignored this. 

"Improbability Drive," she said patiently. "You explained it to me 
yourself. We pass through every point in the Universe, you know 
that." 

"Yeah, but that's one wild coincidence isn't it?" 

"Yes." 

"Picking someone up at that point? Out of the whole of the 
Universe to choose from? That's just too... I want to work this out. 
Computer!" 

The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Shipboard Computer which 
controlled and permeated every particle of the ship switched into 
communication mode. 

"Hi there!" it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tiny 
ribbon of ticker tape just for the record. The ticker tape said, Hi there! 

"Oh God," said Zaphod. He hadn't worked with this computer for 
long but had already learned to loathe it. 

The computer continued, brash and cheery as if it was selling 
detergent. 

"I want you to know that whatever your problem, I am here to help 
you solve it." 

"Yeah yeah," said Zaphod. "Look, I think I'll just use a piece of 
paper." 

"Sure thing," said the computer, spilling out its message into a 
waste bin at the same time, "I understand. If you ever want..." 



"Shut up!" said Zaphod, and snatching up a pencil sat down next to 
Trillian at the console. 

"OK, OK..." said the computer in a hurt tone of voice and closed 
down its speech channel again. 

Zaphod and Trillian pored over the figures that the Improbability 
flight path scanner flashed silently up in front of them. 

"Can we work out," said Zaphod, "from their point of view what the 
Improbability of their rescue was?" 

"Yes, that's a constant", said Trillian, "two to the power of two 
hundred and seventy-six thousand seven hundred and nine to one 
against." 

"That's high. They're two lucky lucky guys." 

"Yes." 

"But relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them 
up..." 

Trillian punched up the figures. They showed two-to-the power-of- 
Infinity-minus-one (an irrational number that only has a conventional 
meaning in Improbability physics). 

"... it's pretty low," continued Zaphod with a slight whistle. 

"Yes," agreed Trillian, and looked at him quizzically. 

"That's one big whack of Improbability to be accounted for. 
Something pretty improbable has got to show up on the balance 
sheet if it's all going to add up into a pretty sum." 

Zaphod scribbled a few sums, crossed them out and threw the 
pencil away. 

"Bat's dots, I can't work it out." 

"Well?" 

Zaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation and gritted his 
teeth. 

"OK," he said. "Computer!" 

The voice circuits sprang to life again. 

"Why hello there!" they said (ticker tape, ticker tape). "All I want to 
do is make your day nicer and nicer and nicer..." 

"Yeah well shut up and work something out for me." 

"Sure thing," chattered the computer, "you want a probability 
forecast based on..." 



"Improbability data, yeah." 

"OK," the computer continued. "Here's an interesting little notion. 
Did you realize that most people's lives are governed by telephone 
numbers?" 

A pained look crawled across one of Zaphod's faces and on to the 
other one. 

"Have you flipped?" he said. 

"No, but you will when I tell you that..." 

Trillian gasped. She scrabbled at the buttons on the Improbability 
flight path screen. 

"Telephone number?" she said. "Did that thing say telephone 
number?" 

Numbers flashed up on the screen. 

The computer had paused politely, but now it continued. 

"What I was about to say was that..." 

"Don't bother please," said Trillian. 

"Look, what is this?" said Zaphod. 

"I don't know," said Trillian, "but those aliens - they're on the way 
up to the bridge with that wretched robot. Can we pick them up on 
any monitor cameras?" 



Chapter 13 


Marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning. 

"... and then of course I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes 
down my left hand side..." 

"No?" said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him. "Really?" 

"Oh yes," said Marvin, "I mean I've asked for them to be replaced 
but no one ever listens." 

"I can imagine." 

Vague whistling and humming noises were coming from Ford. 
"Well well well," he kept saying to himself, "Zaphod Beeblebrox..." 

Suddenly Marvin stopped, and held up a hand. 

"You know what's happened now of course?" 

"No, what?" said Arthur, who didn't what to know. 

"We've arrived at another of those doors." 

There was a sliding door let into the side of the corridor. Marvin 
eyed it suspiciously. 

"Well?" said Ford impatiently. "Do we go through?" 

"Do we go through?" mimicked Marvin. "Yes. This is the entrance 
to the bridge. I was told to take you to the bridge. Probably the 
highest demand that will be made on my intellectual capacities today 
I shouldn't wonder." 

Slowly, with great loathing, he stepped towards the door, like a 
hunter stalking his prey. Suddenly it slid open. 

"Thank you," it said, "for making a simple door very happy." 

Deep in Marvin's thorax gears ground. 

"Funny," he intoned funerally, "how just when you think life can't 
possibly get any worse it suddenly does." 

Fie heaved himself through the door and left Ford and Arthur 
staring at each other and shrugging their shoulders. From inside they 
heard Marvin's voice again. 



"I suppose you want to see the aliens now," he said. "Do you want 
me to sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where I'm standing?" 

"Yeah, just show them in would you Marvin?" came another voice. 

Arthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughing. 

"What's...?" 

"Shhh," said Ford, "come in." 

Fie stepped through into the bridge. 

Arthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a man 
lolling back in a chair with his feet on a control console picking the 
teeth in his right-hand head with his left hand. The right-hand head 
seemed to be thoroughly preoccupied with this task, but the left-hand 
one was grinning a broad, relaxed, nonchalant grin. The number of 
things that Arthur couldn't believe he was seeing was fairly large. FHis 
jaw flapped about at a loose end for a while. 

The peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an appalling 
affectation of nonchalance said, "Ford, hi, how are you? Glad you 
could drop in." 

Ford was not going to be outcooled. 

"Zaphod," he drawled, "great to see you, you're looking well, the 
extra arm suits you. Nice ship you've stolen." 

Arthur goggled at him. 

"You mean you know this guy?" he said, waving a wild finger at 
Zaphod. 

"Know him!" exclaimed Ford, "he's..." he paused, and decided to 
do the introductions the other way round. 

"Oh, Zaphod, this is a friend of mine, Arthur Dent," he said, "I saved 
him when his planet blew up." 

"Oh sure," said Zaphod, "hi Arthur, glad you could make it." FHis 
right-hand head looked round casually, said "hi" and went back to 
having his teeth picked. 

Ford carried on. "And Arthur," he said, "this is my semi-cousin 
Zaphod Beeb..." 

"We've met," said Arthur sharply. 

When you're cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily 
sail past a few hard driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with 
yourself and then accidentally change down from fourth to first 



instead of third thus making your engine leap out of your bonnet in a 
rather ugly mess, it tends to throw you off your stride in much the 
same way that this remark threw Ford Prefect off his. 

"Err... what?" 

"I said we've met." 

Zaphod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum 
sharply. 

"Hey... er, have we? Hey... er..." 

Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry flash in his eyes. Now he felt 
he was back on home ground he suddenly began to resent having 
lumbered himself with this ignorant primitive who knew as much 
about the affairs of the Galaxy as an Ilford-based gnat knew about life 
in Peking. 

"What do you mean you've met?" he demanded. "This is Zaphod 
Beeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you know, not bloody Martin Smith 
from Croydon." 

"I don't care," said Arthur coldly. We've met, haven't we Zaphod 
Beeblebrox - or should I say... Phil?" 

"What!" shouted Ford. 

"You'll have to remind me," said Zaphod. "I've a terrible memory 
for species." 

"It was at a party," pursued Arthur. 

"Yeah, well I doubt that," said Zaphod. 

"Cool it will you Arthur!" demanded Ford. 

Arthur would not be deterred. "A party six months ago. On Earth... 
England..." 

Zaphod shook his head with a tight-lipped smile. 

"London," insisted Arthur, "Islington." 

"Oh," said Zaphod with a guilty start, "that party." 

This wasn't fair on Ford at all. He looked backwards and forwards 
between Arthur and Zaphod. "What?" he said to Zaphod. "You don't 
mean to say you've been on that miserable planet as well do you?" 

"No, of course not," said Zaphod breezily. "Well, I may have just 
dropped in briefly, you know, on my way somewhere..." 

"But I was stuck there for fifteen years!" 

"Well I didn't know that did I?" 



"But what were you doing there?" 

"Looking about, you know." 

"He gatecrashed a party," persisted Arthur, trembling with anger, 

"a fancy dress party..." 

"It would have to be, wouldn't it?" said Ford. 

"At this party," persisted Arthur, "was a girl... oh well, look it 
doesn't matter now. The whole place has gone up in smoke 
anyway..." 

"I wish you'd stop sulking about that bloody planet," said Ford. 
"Who was the lady?" 

"Oh just somebody. Well alright, I wasn't doing very well with her. 
I'd been trying all evening. Hell, she was something though. Beautiful, 
charming, devastatingly intelligent, at last I'd got her to myself for a 
bit and was plying her with a bit of talk when this friend of yours 
barges up and says Hey doll, is this guy boring you? Why don't you 
talk to me instead? I'm from a different planet." I never saw her 
again." 

"Zaphod?" exclaimed Ford. 

"Yes," said Arthur, glaring at him and trying not to feel foolish. "He 
only had the two arms and the one head and he called himself Phil, 
but..." 

"But you must admit he did turn out to be from another planet," 
said Trillian wandering into sight at the other end of the bridge. She 
gave Arthur a pleasant smile which settled on him like a ton of bricks 
and then turned her attention to the ship's controls again. 

There was silence for a few seconds, and then out of the scrambled 
mess of Arthur's brain crawled some words. 

"Tricia McMillian?" he said. "What are you doing here?" 

"Same as you," she said, "I hitched a lift. After all with a degree in 
Maths and another in astrophysics what else was there to do? It was 
either that or the dole queue again on Monday." 

"Infinity minus one," chattered the computer, "Improbability sum 
now complete." 

Zaphod looked about him, at Ford, at Arthur, and then at Trillian. 

"Trillian," he said, "is this sort of thing going to happen every time 
we use the Improbability drive?" 



"Very probably, I'm afraid," she said. 



Chapter 14 


The Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space, now 
on conventional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill at ease 
knowing that they had been brought together not of their own 
volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious principle of 
physics - as if relationships between people were susceptible to the 
same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and 
molecules. 

As the ship's artificial night closed in they were each grateful to 
retire to separate cabins and try to rationalize their thoughts. 

Trillian couldn't sleep. She sat on a couch and stared at a small cage 
which contained her last and only links with Earth - two white mice 
that she had insisted Zaphod let her bring. She had expected not to 
see the planet again, but she was disturbed by her negative reaction 
to the planet's destruction. It seemed remote and unreal and she 
could find no thoughts to think about it. She watched the mice 
scurrying round the cage and running furiously in their little plastic 
treadwheels till they occupied her whole attention. Suddenly she 
shook herself and went back to the bridge to watch over the tiny 
flashing lights and figures that charted the ship's progress through the 
void. She wished she knew what it was she was trying not to think 
about. 

Zaphod couldn't sleep. He also wished he knew what it was that he 
wouldn't let himself think about. For as long as he could remember 
he'd suffered from a vague nagging feeling of being not all there. 

Most of the time he was able to put this thought aside and not worry 
about it, but it had been re-awakened by the sudden inexplicable 
arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. Somehow it seemed to 
conform to a pattern that he couldn't see. 

Ford couldn't sleep. He was too excited about being back on the 
road again. Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over, just as he 
was finally beginning to give up hope. Knocking about with Zaphod for 
a bit promised to be a lot of fun, though there seemed to be 



something faintly odd about his semi-cousin that he couldn't put his 
finger on. The fact that he had become President of the Galaxy was 
frankly astonishing, as was the manner of his leaving the post. Was 
there a reason behind it? There would be no point in asking Zaphod, 
he never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at all: he had 
turned unfathomably into an art form. He attacked everything in life 
with a mixture of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it 
was often difficult to tell which was which. 

Arthur slept: he was terribly tired. 

There was a tap at Zaphod's door. It slid open. 

"Zaphod...?" 

"Yeah?" 

"I think we just found what you came to look for." 

"Hey, yeah?" 

Ford gave up the attempt to sleep. In the corner of his cabin was a 
small computer screen and keyboard. He sat at it for a while and tried 
to compose a new entry for the Guide on the subject of Vogons but 
couldn't think of anything vitriolic enough so he gave that up too, 
wrapped a robe round himself and went for a walk to the bridge. 

As he entered he was surprised to see two figures hunched 
excitedly over the instruments. 

"See? The ship's about to move into orbit," Trillian was saying. 
"There's a planet out there. It's at the exact coordinates you 
predicted." 

Zaphod heard a noise and looked up. 

"Ford!" he hissed. "Hey, come and take a look at this." 

Ford went and had a look at it. It was a series of figures flashing 
over a screen. 

"You recognize those Galactic coordinates?" said Zaphod. 

"No." 

"I'll give you a clue. Computer!" 

"Hi gang!" enthused the computer. "This is getting real sociable 
isn't it?" 

"Shut up," said Zaphod, "and show up the screens." 



Light on the bridge sank. Pinpoints of light played across the 
consoles and reflected in four pairs of eyes that stared up at the 
external monitor screens. 

There was absolutely nothing on them. 

"Recognize that?" whispered Zaphod. 

Ford frowned. 

"Er, no," he said. 

"What do you see?" 

"Nothing." 

"Recognize it?" 

"What are you talking about?" 

"We're in the Horsehead Nebula. One whole vast dark cloud." 

"And I was meant to recognize that from a blank screen?" 

"Inside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy you'd see a 
dark screen." 

"Very good." 

Zaphod laughed. He was clearly very excited about something, 
almost childishly so. 

"Hey, this is really terrific, this is just far too much!" 

"What's so great about being stuck in a dust cloud?" said Ford. 

"What would you reckon to find here?" urged Zaphod. 

"Nothing." 

"No stars? No planets?" 

"No." 

"Computer!" shouted Zaphod, "rotate angle of vision through one 
eighty degrees and don't talk about it!" 

For a moment it seemed that nothing was happening, then a 
brightness glowed at the edge of the huge screen. A red star the size 
of a small plate crept across it followed quickly by another one - a 
binary system. Then a vast crescent sliced into the corner of the 
picture - a red glare shading away into the deep black, the night side 
of the planet. 

"I've found it!" cried Zaphod, thumping the console. "I've found it! 

Ford stared at it in astonishment. 

"What is it?" he said. 



"That..." said Zaphod, "is the most improbable planet that ever 
existed." 



Chapter 15 


(Excerpt from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Page 634784, 
Section 5a, Entry: Magrathea) 

Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days 
of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax free. 

Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking 
adventure and reward amongst the furthest reaches of Galactic space. 
In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real 
men, women were real women, and small furry creatures from Alpha 
Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri. And all 
dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split 
infinitives that no man had split before - and thus was the Empire 
forged. 

Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly 
natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor 
- at least no one worth speaking of. And for all the richest and most 
successful merchants life inevitably became rather dull and niggly, 
and they began to imagine that this was therefore the fault of the 
worlds they'd settled on - none of them was entirely satisfactory: 
either the climate wasn't quite right in the later part of the afternoon, 
or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the wrong 
shade of pink. 

And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of 
specialist industry: custom-made luxury planet building. The home of 
this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers 
sucked matter through white holes in space to form it into dream 
planets - gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber planets with lots 
of earthquakes - all lovingly made to meet the exacting standards 
that the Galaxy's richest men naturally came to expect. 

But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon 
became the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy was 
reduced to abject poverty. And so the system broke down, the Empire 



collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a billion worlds, 
disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars as they laboured 
into the night over smug little treaties on the value of a planned 
political economy. 

Magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the 
obscurity of legend. 

In these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of it. 



Chapter 16 


Arthur awoke to the sound of argument and went to the bridge. 

Ford was waving his arms about. 

"You're crazy, Zaphod," he was saying, "Magrathea is a myth, a 
fairy story, it's what parents tell their kids about at night if they want 
them to grow up to become economists, it's..." 

"And that's what we are currently in orbit around," insisted Zaphod. 

"Look, I can't help what you may personally be in orbit around," 
said Ford, "but this ship..." 

"Computer!" shouted Zaphod. 

"Oh no..." 

"Hi there! This is Eddie your shipboard computer, and I'm feeling 
just great guys, and I know I'm just going to get a bundle of kicks out 
of any programme you care to run through me." 

Arthur looked inquiringly at Trillian. She motioned him to come on 
in but keep quiet. 

"Computer," said Zaphod, "tell us again what our present trajectory 
is." 

"A real pleasure feller," it burbled, "we are currently in orbit at an 
altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet of 
Magrathea." 

"Proving nothing," said Ford. "I wouldn't trust that computer to 
speak my weight." 

"I can do that for you, sure," enthused the computer, punching out 
more tickertape. "I can even work out you personality problems to 
ten decimal places if it will help." 

Trillian interrupted. 

"Zaphod," she said, "any minute now we will be swinging round to 
the daylight side of this planet," adding, "whatever it turns out to be." 

"Fley, what do you mean by that? The planet's where I predicted it 
would be isn't it?" 



"Yes, I know there's a planet there. I'm not arguing with anyone, 
it's just that I wouldn't know Magrathea from any other lump of cold 
rock. Dawn's coming up if you want it." 

"OK, OK," muttered Zaphod, "let's at least give our eyes a good 
time. Computer!" 

"Hi there! What can I..." 

"Just shut up and give us a view of the planet again." 

A dark featureless mass once more filled the screens - the planet 
rolling away beneath them. 

They watched for a moment in silence, but Zaphod was fidgety 
with excitement. 

"We are now traversing the night side..." he said in a hushed voice. 
The planet rolled on. 

"The surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath 
us..." he continued. He was trying to restore a sense of occasion to 
what he felt should have been a great moment. Magrathea! He was 
piqued by Ford's sceptical reaction. Magrathea! 

"In a few seconds," he continued, "we should see... there!" 

The moment carried itself. Even the most seasoned star tramp 
can't help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen from 
space, but a binary sunrise is one of the marvels of the Galaxy. 

Out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding light. 
It crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a thin crescent 
blade, and within seconds two suns were visible, furnaces of light, 
searing the black edge of the horizon with white fire. Fierce shafts of 
colour streaked through the thin atmosphere beneath them. 

"The fires of dawn...!" breathed Zaphod. "The twin suns of 
Soulianis and Rahm...!" 

"Or whatever," said Ford quietly. 

"Soulianis and Rahm!" insisted Zaphod. 

The suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low ghostly music 
floated through the bridge: Marvin was humming ironically because 
he hated humans so much. 

As Ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them excitement 
burnt inside him, but only the excitement of seeing a strange new 
planet, it was enough for him to see it as it was. It faintly irritated him 



that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy on to the scene to 
make it work for him. All this Magrathea nonsense seemed juvenile. 
Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to 
believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too? 

All this Magrathea business seemed totally incomprehensible to 
Arthur. He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going on. 

"I only know what Zaphod's told me," she whispered. "Apparently 
Magrathea is some kind of legend from way back which no one 
seriously believes in. Bit like Atlantis on Earth, except that the legends 
say the Magratheans used to manufacture planets." 

Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something 
important. Suddenly he realized what it was. 

"Is there any tea on this spaceship?" he asked. 

More of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the Heart of 
Gold streaked along its orbital path. The suns now stood high in the 
black sky, the pyrotechnics of dawn were over, and the surface of the 
planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the common light of day - 
grey, dusty and only dimly contoured. It looked dead and cold as a 
crypt. From time to time promising features would appear on the 
distant horizon - ravines, maybe mountains, maybe even cities - but 
as they approached the lines would soften and blur into anonymity 
and nothing would transpire. The planet's surface was blurred by time, 
by the slow movement of the thin stagnant air that had crept across it 
for century upon century. 

Clearly, it was very very old. 

A moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the grey 
landscape move beneath them. The immensity of time worried him, 
he could feel it as a presence. He cleared his throat. 

"Well, even supposing it is..." 

"It is," said Zaphod. 

"Which it isn't," continued Ford. "What do you want with it anyway? 
There's nothing there." 

"Not on the surface," said Zaphod. 

"Alright, just supposing there's something. I take it you're not here 
for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all. What are you after?" 



One of Zaphod's heads looked away. The other one looked round 
to see what the first was looking at, but it wasn't looking at anything 
very much. 

"Well," said Zaphod airily, "it's partly the curiosity, partly a sense of 
adventure, but mostly I think it's the fame and the money..." 

Ford glanced at him sharply. He got a very strong impression that 
Zaphod hadn't the faintest idea why he was there at all. 

"You know I don't like the look of that planet at all," said Trillian 
shivering. 

"Ah, take no notice," said Zaphod, "with half the wealth of the 
former Galactic Empire stored on it somewhere it can afford to look 
frumpy." 

Bullshit, thought Ford. Even supposing this was the home of some 
ancient civilization now gone to dust, even supposing a number of 
exceedingly unlikely things, there was no way that vast treasures of 
wealth were going to be stored there in any form that would still have 
meaning now. He shrugged. 

"I think it's just a dead planet," he said. 

"The suspense is killing me," said Arthur testily. 

Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all 
parts of the Galaxy, and it is in order that this situation should not in 
any way be exacerbated that the following facts will now be revealed 
in advance. 

The planet in question is in fact the legendary Magrathea. 

The deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient 
automatic defence system will result merely in the breakage of three 
coffee cups and a micecage, the bruising of somebody's upper arm, 
and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowl of petunias 
and an innocent sperm whale. 

In order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no 
revelation will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustained 
the bruise. This fact may safely be made the subject of suspense since 
it is of no significance whatsoever. 



Chapter 17 


After a fairly shaky start to the day, Arthur's mind was beginning to 
reassemble itself from the shellshocked fragments the previous day 
had left him with. He had found a Nutri-Matic machine which had 
provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, 
but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The way it functioned was very 
interesting. When the Drink button was pressed it made an instant 
but highly detailed examination of the subject's taste buds, a 
spectroscopic analysis of the subject's metabolism and then sent tiny 
experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centres 
of the subject's brain to see what was likely to go down well. However, 
no one knew quite why it did this because it invariably delivered a 
cupful of liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The 
Nutri-Matic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius Cybernetics 
Corporation whose complaints department now covers all the major 
land masses of the first three planets in the Sirius Tau Star system. 

Arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving. He glanced up at the 
screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren 
greyness slide past. It suddenly occurred to him to ask a question 
which had been bothering him. 

"Is it safe?" he said. 

"Magrathea's been dead for five million years," said Zaphod, "of 
course it's safe. Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised 
families by now." At which point a strange and inexplicable sound 
thrilled suddenly through the bridge - a noise as of a distant fanfare; 
a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound. It preceded a voice that was 
equally hollow, reedy and insubstantial. The voice said "Greetings to 
you..." 

Someone from the dead planet was talking to them. 

"Computer!" shouted Zaphod. 

"Hi there!" 


"What the photon is it?" 



"Oh, just some five-million-year-old tape that's being broadcast at 
us." 

"A what? A recording?" 

"Shush!" said Ford. "It's carrying on." 

The voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was 
underscored with quite unmistakable menace. 

"This is a recorded announcement," it said, "as I'm afraid we're all 
out at the moment. The commercial council of Magrathea thanks you 
for your esteemed visit..." 

("A voice from ancient Magrathea!" shouted Zaphod. "OK, OK," 
said Ford.) 

"... but regrets," continued the voice, "that the entire planet is 
temporarily closed for business. Thank you. If you would care to leave 
your name and the address of a planet where you can be contacted, 
kindly speak when you hear the tone." 

A short buzz followed, then silence. 

"They want to get rid of us," said Trillian nervously. "What do we 
do?" 

"It's just a recording," said Zaphod. "We keep going. Got that, 
computer?" 

"I got it," said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of 
speed. 

They waited. 

After a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the 
voice. 

"We would like to assure you that as soon as our business is 
resumed announcements will be made in all fashionable magazines 
and colour supplements, when our clients will once again be able to 
select from all that's best in contemporary geography." The menace 
in the voice took on a sharper edge. "Meanwhile we thank our clients 
for their kind interest and would ask them to leave. Now." 

Arthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions. 

"Well, I suppose we'd better be going then, hadn't we?" he 
suggested. 

"Shhh!" said Zaphod. "There's absolutely nothing to be worried 
about." 



"Then why's everyone so tense?" 

"They're just interested!" shouted Zaphod. "Computer, start a 
descent into the atmosphere and prepare for landing." 

This time the fanfare was quite perfunctory, the voice distinctly 
cold. 

"It is most gratifying," it said, "that your enthusiasm for our planet 
continues unabated, and so we would like to assure you that the 
guided missiles currently converging with your ship are part of a 
special service we extend to all of our most enthusiastic clients, and 
the fully armed nuclear warheads are of course merely a courtesy 
detail. We look forward to your custom in future lives... thank you." 

The voice snapped off. 

"Oh," said Trillian. 

"Er..." said Arthur. 

"Well?" said Ford. 

"Look," said Zaphod, "will you get it into your heads? That's just a 
recorded message. It's millions of years old. It doesn't apply to us, get 
it?" 

"What," said Trillian quietly, "about the missiles?" 

"Missiles? Don't make me laugh." 

Ford tapped Zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear 
screen. Clear in the distance behind them two silver darts were 
climbing through the atmosphere towards the ship. A quick change of 
magnification brought them into close focus - two massively real 
rockets thundering through the sky. The suddenness of it was 
shocking. 

"I think they're going to have a very good try at applying to us," 
said Ford. 

Zaphod stared at them in astonishment. 

"Hey this is terrific!" he said. "Someone down there is trying to kill 
us!" 

"Terrific," said Arthur. 

"But don't you see what this means?" 

"Yes. We're going to die." 

"Yes, but apart from that." 

"Apart from that?" 



"It means we must be on to something!" 

"How soon can we get off it?" 

Second by second the image of the missiles on the screen became 
larger. They had swung round now on to a direct homing course so 
that all that could be seen of them now was the warheads, head on. 

"As a matter of interest," said Trillian, "what are we going to do?" 

"Just keep cool," said Zaphod. 

"Is that all?" shouted Arthur. 

"No, we're also going to... er... take evasive action!" said Zaphod 
with a sudden access of panic. "Computer, what evasive action can 
we take?" 

"Er, none I'm afraid, guys," said the computer. 

"... or something," said Zaphod,"... er..." he said. 

"There seems to be something jamming my guidance system," 
explained the computer brightly, "impact minus forty-five seconds. 
Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relax." 

Zaphod tried to run in several equally decisive directions 
simultaneously. "Right!" he said. "Er... we've got to get manual 
control of this ship." 

"Can you fly her?" asked Ford pleasantly. 

"No, can you?" 

"No." 

"Trillian, can you?" 

"No." 

"Fine," said Zaphod, relaxing. "We'll do it together." 

"I can't either," said Arthur, who felt it was time he began to assert 
himself. 

"I'd guessed that," said Zaphod. "OK computer, I want full manual 
control now." 

"You got it," said the computer. 

Several large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles 
sprang up out of them, showering the crew with bits of expanded 
polystyrene packaging and balls of rolled-up cellophane: these 
controls had never been used before. 

Zaphod stared at them wildly. 



"OK, Ford," he said, "full retro thrust and ten degrees starboard. Or 
something..." 

"Good luck guys," chirped the computer, "impact minus thirty 
seconds..." 

Ford leapt to the controls - only a few of them made any 
immediate sense to him so he pulled those. The ship shook and 
screamed as its guidance rocked jets tried to push it every which way 
simultaneously. Fie released half of them and the ship span round in a 
tight arc and headed back the way it had come, straight towards the 
oncoming missiles. 

Air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone 
was thrown against them. For a few seconds the inertial forces held 
them flattened and squirming for breath, unable to move. Zaphod 
struggled and pushed in manic desperation and finally managed a 
savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the guidance system. 

The lever snapped off. The ship twisted sharply and rocketed 
upwards. The crew were hurled violently back across the cabin. Ford's 
copy of The FHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy smashed into another 
section of the control console with the combined result that the 
Guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen about the best 
ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of Antares (an 
Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a revolting but much 
sought after cocktail delicacy and very large sums of money are often 
paid for them by very rich idiots who want to impress other very rich 
idiots), and the ship suddenly dropped out of the sky like a stone. 

It was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew 
sustained a nasty bruise to the upper arm. This should be emphasized 
because, as had already been revealed, they escape otherwise 
completely unharmed and the deadly nuclear missiles do not 
eventually hit the ship. The safety of the crew is absolutely assured. 

"Impact minus twenty seconds, guys..." said the computer. 

"Then turn the bloody engines back on!" bawled Zaphod. 

"OK, sure thing, guys," said the computer. With a subtle roar the 
engines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive and 
headed back towards the missiles again. 

The computer started to sing. 



"When you walk through the storm..." it whined nasally, "hold your 
head up high..." 

Zaphod screamed at it to shut up, but his voice was lost in the din 
of what they quite naturally assumed was approaching destruction. 

"And don't... be afraid... of the dark!" Eddie wailed. 

The ship, in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside down 
and lying on the ceiling as they were it was now totally impossible for 
any of the crew to reach the guidance systems. 

"At the end of the storm..." crooned Eddie. 

The two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they 
thundered towards the ship. 

"... is a golden sky..." 

But by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully 
corrected their flight paths to that of the erratically weaving ship, and 
they passed right under it. 

"And the sweet silver songs of the lark... Revised impact time 
fifteen seconds fellas... Walk on through the wind..." 

The missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back 
into pursuit. 

"This is it," said Arthur watching them. "We are now quite 
definitely going to die aren't we?" 

"I wish you'd stop saying that," shouted Ford. 

"Well we are aren't we?" 

"Yes." 

"Walk on through the rain..." sang Eddie. 

A thought struck Arthur. He struggled to his feet. 

"Why doesn't anyone turn on this Improbability Drive thing?" he 
said. "We could probably reach that." 

"What are you crazy?" said Zaphod. "Without proper programming 
anything could happen." 

"Does that matter at this stage?" shouted Arthur. 

"Though your dreams be tossed and blown..." sand Eddie. 

Arthur scrambled up on to one end of the excitingly chunky pieces 
of moulded contouring where the curve of the wall met the ceiling. 

"Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart..." 



"Does anyone know why Arthur can't turn on the Improbability 
Drive?" shouted Trillian. 

"And you'll never walk alone... Impact minus five seconds, it's been 
great knowing you guys, God bless... You'll ne... ver... walk... alone!" 

"I said," yelled Trillian, "does anyone know..." 

The next thing that happened was a mid-mangling explosion of 
noise and light. 



Chapter 18 


And the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of 
Gold continued on its way perfectly normally with a rather fetchingly 
redesigned interior. It was somewhat larger, and done out in delicate 
pastel shades of green and blue. In the centre a spiral staircase, 
leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray of ferns and yellow 
flowers and next to it a stone sundial pedestal housed the main 
computer terminal. Cunningly deployed lighting and mirrors created 
the illusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of 
exquisitely manicured garden. Around the periphery of the 
conservatory area stood marble-topped tables on intricately beautiful 
wrought-iron legs. As you gazed into the polished surface of the 
marble the vague forms of instruments became visible, and as you 
touched them the instruments materialized instantly under your 
hands. Looked at from the correct angles the mirrors appeared to 
reflect all the required data readouts, though it was far from clear 
where they were reflected from. It was in fact sensationally beautiful. 

Relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, "What 
the hell happened?" 

"Well I was just saying," said Arthur lounging by a small fish pool, 
"there's this Improbability Drive switch over here..." he waved at 
where it had been. There was a potted plant there now. 

"But where are we?" said Ford who was sitting on the spiral 
staircase, a nicely chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his hand. 

"Exactly where we were, I think..." said Trillian, as all about them 
the mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscape of 
Magrathea which still scooted along beneath them. 

Zaphod leapt out of his seat. 

"Then what's happened to the missiles?" he said. 

A new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors. 

"They would appear," said Ford doubtfully, "to have turned into a 
bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale..." 



"At an Improbability Factor," cut in Eddie, who hadn't changed a bit, 
"of eight million seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand one 
hundred and twenty-eight to one against." 

Zaphod stared at Arthur. 

"Did you think of that, Earthman?" he demanded. 

"Well," said Arthur, "all I did was..." 

"That's very good thinking you know. Turn on the Improbability 
Drive for a second without first activating the proofing screens. Hey 
kid you just saved our lives, you know that?" 

"Oh," said Arthur, "well, it was nothing really..." 

"Was it?" said Zaphod. "Oh well, forget it then. OK, computer, take 
us in to land." 

"But..." 

"I said forget it." 

Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all 
probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence 
several miles above the surface of an alien planet. 

And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this 
poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its 
identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being 
a whale any more. 

This is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it began 
its life till the moment it ended it. 

Ah...! What's happening? it thought. 

Er, excuse me, who am I? 

Hello? 

Why am I here? What's my purpose in life? 

What do I mean by who am I? 

Calm down, get a grip now... oh! this is an interesting sensation, 
what is it? It's a sort of... yawning, tingling sensation in my... my... well 
I suppose I'd better start finding names for things if I want to make 
any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I 
shall call the world, so let's call it my stomach. 

Good. Ooooh, it's getting quite strong. And hey, what's about this 
whistling roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going to call my 



head? Perhaps I can call that... wind! Is that a good name? It'll do... 
perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I've found out what 
it's for. It must be something very important because there certainly 
seems to be a hell of a lot of it. Hey! What's this thing? This... let's call 
it a tail - yeah, tail. Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty good can't I? 
Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesn't seem to achieve very much but 
I'll probably find out what it's for later on. Now - have I built up any 
coherent picture of things yet? 

No. 

Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, 
so much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy with anticipation... 

Or is it the wind? 

There really is a lot of that now isn't it? 

And wow! Hey! What's this thing suddenly coming towards me 
very fast? Very very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide 
sounding name like... ow... ound... round... ground! That's it! That's a 
good name - ground! 

I wonder if it will be friends with me? 

And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence. 

Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the 
bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have 
speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had 
thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the 
universe than we do now. 



Chapter 19 


"Are we taking this robot with us?" said Ford, looking with distaste 
at Marvin who was standing in an awkward hunched posture in the 
corner under a small palm tree. 

Zaphod glanced away from the mirror screens which presented a 
panoramic view of the blighted landscape on which the Heart of Gold 
had now landed. 

"Oh, the Paranoid Android," he said. "Yeah, we'll take him." 

"But what are supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?" 

"You think you've got problems," said Marvin as if he was 
addressing a newly occupied coffin, "what are you supposed to do if 
you are a manically depressed robot? No, don't bother to answer that. 
I'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don't 
know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to 
your level." 

Trillian burst in through the door from her cabin. 

"My white mice have escaped!" she said. 

An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of 
Zaphod's faces. 

"Nuts to your white mice," he said. 

Trillian glared an upset glare at him, and disappeared again. 

It is possible that her remark would have commanded greater 
attention had it been generally realized that human beings were only 
the third most intelligent life form present on the planet Earth, 
instead of (as was generally thought by most independent observers) 
the second. 

"Good afternoon boys." 

The voice was oddly familiar, but oddly different. It had a 
matriarchal twang. It announced itself to the crew as they arrived at 
the airlock hatchway that would let them out on the planet surface. 



They looked at each other in puzzlement. 

"It's the computer," explained Zaphod. "I discovered it had an 
emergency back-up personality that I thought might work out better." 

"Now this is going to be your first day out on a strange new 
planet," continued Eddie's new voice, "so I want you all wrapped up 
snug and warm, and no playing with any naughty bug-eyed 
monsters." 

Zaphod tapped impatiently on the hatch. 

"I'm sorry," he said, "I think we might be better off with a slide 
rule." 

"Right!" snapped the computer. "Who said that?" 

"Will you open the exit hatch please, computer?" said Zaphod 
trying not to get angry. 

"Not until whoever said that owns up," urged the computer, 
stamping a few synapses closed. 

"Oh God," muttered Ford, slumped against a bulkhead and started 
to count to ten. He was desperately worried that one day sentinent 
life forms would forget how to do this. Only by counting could 
humans demonstrate their independence of computers. 

"Come on," said Eddie sternly. 

"Computer..." began Zaphod... 

"I'm waiting," interrupted Eddie. "I can wait all day if necessary..." 

"Computer..." said Zaphod again, who had been trying to think of 
some subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with, and 
had decided not to bother competing with it on its own ground, "if 
you don't open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight off to 
your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large axe, got 
that?" 

Eddie, shocked, paused and considered this. 

Ford carried on counting quietly. This is about the most aggressive 
thing you can do to a computer, the equivalent of going up to a 
human being and saying Blood... blood... blood... blood... 

Finally Eddie said quietly, "I can see this relationship is something 
we're all going to have to work at," and the hatchway opened. 

An icy wind ripped into them, they hugged themselves warmly and 
stepped down the ramp on to the barren dust of Magrathea. 



"It'll all end in tears, I know it," shouted Eddie after them and 
closed the hatchway again. 

A few minutes later he opened and closed the hatchway again 
response to a command that caught him entirely by surprise. 



Chapter 20 


Five figures wandered slowly over the blighted land. Bits of it were 
dullish grey, bits of it dullish brown, the rest of it rather less 
interesting to look at. It was like a dried-out marsh, now barren of all 
vegetation and covered with a layer of dust about an inch thick. It was 
very cold. 

Zaphod was clearly rather depressed about it. He stalked off by 
himself and was soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in the ground. 

The wind stung Arthur's eyes and ears, and the stale thin air 
clasped his throat. However, the thing stung most was his mind. 

"It's fantastic..." he said, and his own voice rattled his ears. Sound 
carried badly in this thin atmosphere. 

"Desolate hole if you ask me," said Ford. "I could have more fun in 
a cat litter." He felt a mounting irritation. Of all the planets in all the 
star systems of all the Galaxy - didn't he just have to turn up at a 
dump like this after fifteen years of being a castaway? Not even a hot 
dog stand in evidence. He stooped down and picked up a cold clot of 
earth, but there was nothing underneath it worth crossing thousands 
of light years to look at. 

"No," insisted Arthur, "don't you understand, this is the first time 
I've actually stood on the surface of another planet... a whole alien 
world...! Pity it's such a dump though." 

Trillian hugged herself, shivered and frowned. She could have 
sworn she saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the corner 
of her eye, but when she glanced in that direction all she could see 
was the ship, still and silent, a hundred yards or so behind them. 

She was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of 
Zaphod standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to them to 
come and join him. 

He seemed to be excited, but they couldn't clearly hear what he 
was saying because of the thinnish atmosphere and the wind. 



As they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware 
that it seemed to be circular - a crater about a hundred and fifty 
yards wide. Round the outside of the crater the sloping ground was 
spattered with black and red lumps. They stopped and looked at a 
piece. It was wet. It was rubbery. 

With horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat. 

At the top of the crater's lip they met Zaphod. 

"Look," he said, pointing into the crater. 

In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that 
hadn't lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot. The silence 
was only disturbed by the slight involuntary spasms of Trillian's throat. 

"I suppose there's no point in trying to bury it?" murmured Arthur, 
and then wished he hadn't. 

"Come," said Zaphod and started back down into the crater. 

"What, down there?" said Trillian with severe distaste. 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "come on. I've got something to show you." 

"We can see it," said Trillian. 

"Not that," said Zaphod, "something else. Come on." 

They all hesitated. 

"Come on," insisted Zaphod, "I've found a way in." 

"In?" said Arthur in horror. 

"Into the interior of the planet! An underground passage. The force 
of the whale's impact cracked it open, and that's where we have to go. 
Where no man has trod these five million years, into the very depths 
of time itself..." 

Marvin started his ironical humming again. 

Zaphod hit him and he shut up. 

With little shudders of disgust they all followed Zaphod down the 
incline into the crater, trying very hard not to look at its unfortunate 
creator. 

"Life," said Marvin dolefully, "loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it." 

The ground had caved in where the whale had hit it revealing a 
network of galleries and passages, now largely obstructed by 
collapsed rubble and entrails. Zaphod had made a start clearing a way 
into one of them, but Marvin was able to do it rather faster. Dank air 



wafted out of its dark recesses, and as Zaphod shone a torch into it, 
little was visible in the dusty gloom. 

"According to the legends," he said, "the Magratheans lived most 
of their lives underground." 

"Why's that?" said Arthur. "Did the surface become too polluted or 
overpopulated?" 

"No, I don't think so," said Zaphod. "I think they just didn't like it 
very much." 

"Are you sure you know what you're doing?" said Trillian peering 
nervously into the darkness. "We've been attacked once already you 
know." 

"Look kid, I promise you the live population of this planet is nil plus 
the four of us, so come on, let's get on in there. Er, hey Earthman..." 

"Arthur," said Arthur. 

"Yeah could you just sort of keep this robot with you and guard this 
end of the passageway. OK?" 

"Guard?" said Arthur. "What from? You just said there's no one 
here." 

"Yeah, well, just for safety, OK?" said Zaphod. 

"Whose? Yours or mine?" 

"Good lad. OK, here we go." 

Zaphod scrambled down into the passage, followed by Trillian and 
Ford. 

"Well I hope you all have a really miserable time," complained 
Arthur. 

"Don't worry," Marvin assured him, "they will." 

In a few seconds they had disappeared from view. 

Arthur stamped around in a huff, and then decided that a whale's 
graveyard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around in. 

Marvin eyed him balefully for a moment, and then turned himself 
off. 

Zaphod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, 
but trying to hide it by striding purposefully. He flung the torch beam 
around. The walls were covered in dark tiles and were cold to the 
touch, the air thick with decay. 



"There, what did I tell you?" he said. "An inhabited planet. 
Magrathea," and he strode on through the dirt and debris that 
littered the tile floor. 

Trillian was reminded unavoidably of the London Underground, 
though it was less thoroughly squalid. 

At intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics - 
simple angular patterns in bright colours. Trillian stopped and studied 
one of them but could not interpret any sense in them. She called to 
Zaphod. 

"Hey, have you any idea what these strange symbols are?" 

"I think they're just strange symbols of some kind," said Zaphod, 
hardly glancing back. 

Trillian shrugged and hurried after him. 

From time to time a doorway led either to the left or right into 
smallish chambers which Ford discovered to be full of derelict 
computer equipment. He dragged Zaphod into one to have a look. 
Trillian followed. 

"Look," said Ford, "you reckon this is Magrathea..." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "and we heard the voice, right?" 

"OK, so I've bought the fact that it's Magrathea - for the moment. 
What you have so far said nothing about is how in the Galaxy you 
found it. You didn't just look it up in a star atlas, that's for sure." 

"Research. Government archives. Detective work. Few lucky 
guesses. Easy." 

"And then you stole the Heart of Gold to come and look for it 
with?" 

"I stole it to look for a lot of things." 

"A lot of things?" said Ford in surprise. "Like what?" 

"I don't know." 

"What?" 

"I don't know what I'm looking for." 

"Why not?" 

"Because... because... I think it might be because if I knew I 
wouldn't be able to look for them." 


"What, are you crazy?" 



"It's a possibility I haven't ruled out yet," said Zaphod quietly. "I 
only know as much about myself as my mind can work out under its 
current conditions. And its current conditions are not good." 

For a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod with 
a mind suddenly full of worry. 

"Listen old friend, if you want to..." started Ford eventually. 

"No, wait... I'll tell you something," said Zaphod. "I freewheel a lot. 

I get an idea to do something, and, hey, why not, I do it. I reckon I'll 
become President of the Galaxy, and it just happens, it's easy. I decide 
to steal this ship. I decide to look for Magrathea, and it all just 
happens. Yeah, I work out how it can best be done, right, but it always 
works out. It's like having a Galacticredit card which keeps on working 
though you never send off the cheques. And then whenever I stop 
and think - why did I want to do something? - how did I work out 
how to do it? - I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it. 
Like I have now. It's a big effort to talk about it." 

Zaphod paused for a while. For a while there was silence. Then he 
frowned and said, "Last night I was worrying about this again. About 
the fact that part of my mind just didn't seem to work properly. Then 
it occurred to me that the way it seemed was that someone else was 
using my mind to have good ideas with, without telling me about it. I 
put the two ideas together and decided that maybe that somebody 
had locked off part of my mind for that purpose, which was why I 
couldn't use it. I wondered if there was a way I could check. 

"I went to the ship's medical bay and plugged myself into the 
encephelographic screen. I went through every major screening test 
on both my heads - all the tests I had to go through under 
government medical officers before my nomination for Presidency 
could be properly ratified. They showed up nothing. Nothing 
unexpected at least. They showed that I was clever, imaginative, 
irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn't have 
guessed. And no other anomalies. So I started inventing further tests, 
completely at random. Nothing. Then I tried superimposing the 
results from one head on top of the results from the other head. Still 
nothing. Finally I got silly, because I'd given it all up as nothing more 
than an attack of paranoia. Last thing I did before I packed it in was 
take the superimposed picture and look at it through a green filter. 
You remember I was always superstitious about the color green when 



I was a kid? I always wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading 
scouts?" 

Ford nodded. 

"And there it was," said Zaphod, "clear as day. A whole section in 
the middle of both brains that related only to each other and not to 
anything else around them. Some bastard had cauterized all the 
synapses and electronically traumatised those two lumps of 
cerebellum." 

Ford stared at him, aghast. Trillian had turned white. 

"Somebody did that to you?" whispered Ford. 

"Yeah." 

"But have you any idea who? Or why?" 

"Why? I can only guess. But I do know who the bastard was." 

"You know? Flow do you know?" 

"Because they left their initials burnt into the cauterized synapses. 
They left them there for me to see." 

Ford stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawl. 

"Initials? Burnt into your brain?" 

"Yeah." 

"Well, what were they, for God's sake?" 

Zaphod looked at him in silence again for a moment. Then he 
looked away. 

"Z.B.," he said. 

At that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them and 
gas started to pour into the chamber. 

"I'll tell you about it later," choked Zaphod as all three passed out. 



Chapter 21 


On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily. 

Ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to 
the Galaxy to while away the time with. He pushed a few buttons at 
random. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited book 
and contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a 
good idea at the time. 

One of these (the one Arthur now came across) supposedly relates 
the experiences of one Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at the 
University of Maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career 
studying ancient philology, transformational ethics and the wave 
harmonic theory of historical perception, and then, after a night of 
drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with Zaphod Beeblebrox, 
became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had 
happened to all the biros he'd bought over the past few years. 

There followed a long period of painstaking research during which 
he visited all the major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and 
eventually came up with a quaint little theory which quite caught the 
public imagination at the time. Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, 
along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, 
walking treeoids and superintendent shades of the colour blue, there 
was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms. And it was to 
this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping 
away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they 
knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly 
biro-oriented stimuli, and generally leading the biro equivalent of the 
good life. 

And as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until Veet 
Voojagig suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have 
worked there for a while driving a limousine for a family of cheap 
green retractables, whereupon he was taken away, locked up, wrote 



a book, and was finally sent into tax exile, which is the usual fate 
reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of themselves 
in public. 

When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates 
that Voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small 
asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that 
nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying. 

There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 
60,000 Altairan dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank account, 
and of course Zaphod Beeblebrox's highly profitable second-hand biro 
business. 

Arthur read this, and put the book down. 

The robot still sat there, completely inert. 

Arthur got up and walked to the top of the crater. He walked 
around the crater. He watched two suns set magnificently over 
Magrathea. 

He went back down into the crater. He woke the robot up because 
even a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody. 

"Night's falling," he said. "Look robot, the stars are coming out." 

From the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to see very few stars, 
and only very faintly, but they were there to be seen. 

The robot obediently looked at them, then looked back. 

"I know," he said. "Wretched isn't it?" 

"But that sunset! I've never seen anything like it in my wildest 
dreams... the two suns! It was like mountains of fire boiling into 
space." 

"I've seen it," said Marvin. "It's rubbish." 

"We only ever had the one sun at home," persevered Arthur, "I 
came from a planet called Earth you know." 

"I know," said Marvin, "you keep going on about it. It sounds 
awful." 

"Ah no, it was a beautiful place." 

"Did it have oceans?" 

"Oh yes," said Arthur with a sigh, "great wide rolling blue oceans..." 

"Can't bear oceans," said Marvin. 



"Tell me," inquired Arthur, "do you get on well with other robots?" 

"Hate them," said Marvin. "Where are you going?" 

Arthur couldn't bear any more. He had got up again. 

"I think I'll just take another walk," he said. 

"Don't blame you," said Marvin and counted five hundred and 
ninety-seven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a 
second later. 

Arthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his circulation 
a little more enthusiastic about its job. He trudged back up the wall of 
the crater. 

Because the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no 
moon, nightfall was very rapid and it was by now very dark. Because 
of this, Arthur practically walked into the old man before he noticed 
him. 



Chapter 22 


He was standing with his back to Arthur watching the very last 
glimmers of light sink into blackness behind the horizon. He was 
tallish, elderly and dressed in a single long grey robe. When he turned 
his face was thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind, the sort 
of face you would happily bank with. But he didn't turn yet, not even 
to react to Arthur's yelp of surprise. 

Eventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely, and he 
turned. His face was still illuminated from somewhere, and when 
Arthur looked for the source of the light he saw that a few yards away 
stood a small craft of some kind - a small hovercraft, Arthur guessed. 
It shed a dim pool of light around it. 

The man looked at Arthur, sadly it seemed. 

"You choose a cold night to visit our dead planet," he said. 

"Who... who are you?" stammered Arthur. 

The man looked away. Again a kind of sadness seemed to cross his 
face. 

"My name is not important," he said. 

He seemed to have something on his mind. Conversation was 
clearly something he felt he didn't have to rush at. Arthur felt 
awkward. 

"I... er... you startled me..." he said, lamely. 

The man looked round to him again and slightly raised his 
eyebrows. 

"Hmmmm?" he said. 

"I said you startled me." 

"Do not be alarmed, I will not harm you." 

Arthur frowned at him. "But you shot at us! There were missiles..." 
he said. 

The man chuckled slightly. 



"An automatic system," he said and gave a small sigh. "Ancient 
computers ranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark 
millennia, and the ages hang heavy on their dusty data banks. I think 
they take the occasional pot shot to relieve the monotony." 

He looked gravely at Arthur and said, "I'm a great fan of science 
you know." 

"Oh... er, really?" said Arthur, who was beginning to find the man's 
curious, kindly manner disconcerting. 

"Oh, yes," said the old man, and simply stopped talking again. 

"Ah," said Arthur, "er..." He had an odd felling of being like a man 
in the act of adultery who is surprised when the woman's husband 
wanders into the room, changes his trousers, passes a few idle 
remarks about the weather and leaves again. 

"You seem ill at ease," said the old man with polite concern. 

"Er, no... well, yes. Actually you see, we weren't really expecting to 
find anybody about in fact. I sort of gathered that you were all dead 
or something..." 

"Dead?" said the old man. "Good gracious no, we have but slept." 

"Slept?" said Arthur incredulously. 

"Yes, through the economic recession you see," said the old man, 
apparently unconcerned about whether Arthur understood a word he 
was talking about or not. 

"Er, economic recession?" 

"Well you see, five million years ago the Galactic economy 
collapsed, and seeing that custom-made planets are something of a 
luxury commodity you see..." 

He paused and looked at Arthur. 

"You know we built planets do you?" he asked solemnly. 

"Well yes," said Arthur, "I’d sort of gathered..." 

"Fascinating trade," said the old man, and a wistful look came into 
his eyes, "doing the coastlines was always my favourite. Used to have 
endless fun doing the little bits in fjords... so anyway," he said trying 
to find his thread again, "the recession came and we decided it would 
save us a lot of bother if we just slept through it. So we programmed 
the computers to revive us when it was all over." 

The man stifled a very slight yawn and continued. 



"The computers were index linked to the Galactic stock market 
prices you see, so that we'd all be revived when everybody else had 
rebuilt the economy enough to afford our rather expensive services." 

Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this. 

"That's a pretty unpleasant way to behave isn't it?" 

"Is it?" asked the old man mildly. "I'm sorry. I'm a bit out of touch." 

He pointed down into the crater. 

"Is that robot yours?" he said. 

"No," came a thin metallic voice from the crater, "I'm mine." 

"If you'd call it a robot," muttered Arthur. "It's more a sort of 
electronic sulking machine." 

"Bring it," said the old man. Arthur was quite surprised to hear a 
note of decision suddenly present in the old man's voice. He called to 
Marvin who crawled up the slope making a big show of being lame, 
which he wasn't. 

"On second thoughts," said the old man, "leave it here. You must 
come with me. Great things are afoot." He turned towards his craft 
which, though no apparent signal had been given, now drifted quietly 
towards them through the dark. 

Arthur looked down at Marvin, who now made an equally big show 
of turning round laboriously and trudging off down into the crater 
again muttering sour nothings to himself. 

"Come," called the old man, "come now or you will be late." 

"Late?" said Arthur. "What for?" 

"What is your name, human?" 

"Dent. Arthur Dent," said Arthur. 

"Late, as in the late Dentarthurdent," said the old man, sternly. "It's 
a sort of threat you see." Another wistful look came into his tired old 
eyes. "I've never been very good at them myself, but I'm told they can 
be very effective." 

Arthur blinked at him. 

"What an extraordinary person," he muttered to himself. 

"I beg your pardon?" said the old man. 

"Oh nothing, I'm sorry," said Arthur in embarrassment. "Alright, 
where do we go?" 



"In my aircar," said the old man motioning Arthur to get into the 
craft which had settled silently next to them. "We are going deep into 
the bowels of the planet where even now our race is being revived 
from its five-million-year slumber. Magrathea awakes." 

Arthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself next to the old 
man. The strangeness of it, the silent bobbing movement of the craft 
as it soared into the night sky quite unsettled him. 

He looked at the old man, his face illuminated by the dull glow of 
tiny lights on the instrument panel. 

"Excuse me," he said to him, "what is your name by the way?" 

"My name?" said the old man, and the same distant sadness came 
into his face again. He paused. "My name," he said,"... is 
Slartibartfast." 

Arthur practically choked. 

"I beg your pardon?" he spluttered. 

"Slartibartfast," repeated the old man quietly. 

"Slartibartfast?" 

The old man looked at him gravely. 

"I said it wasn't important," he said. 

The aircar sailed through the night. 



Chapter 23 


It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what 
they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always 
assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had 
achieved so much - the wheel. New York, wars and so on - whilst all 
the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a 
good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they 
were far more intelligent than man - for precisely the same reasons. 

Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending 
destruction of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert 
mankind of the danger; but most of their communications were 
misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for 
tidbits, so they eventually gave up and left the Earth by their own 
means shortly before the Vogons arrived. 

The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly 
sophisticated attempt to do a double-backwards-somersault through 
a hoop whilst whistling the "Star Sprangled Banner", but in fact the 
message was this: So long and thanks for all the fish. 

In fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent 
than dolphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural 
research laboratories running round inside wheels and conducting 
frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man. The fact that 
once again man completely misinterpreted this relationship was 
entirely according to these creatures' plans. 



Chapter 24 


Silently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness, a single soft 
glow of light that was utterly alone in the deep Magrathean night. It 
sped swiftly. Arthur's companion seemed sunk in his own thoughts, 
and when Arthur tried on a couple of occasions to engage him in 
conversation again he would simply reply by asking if he was 
comfortable enough, and then left it at that. 

Arthur tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling, but 
the blackness outside was absolute and he was denied any reference 
points. The sense of motion was so soft and slight he could almost 
believe they were hardly moving at all. 

Then a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and within 
seconds had grown so much in size that Arthur realized it was 
travelling towards them at a colossal speed, and he tried to make out 
what sort of craft it might be. He peered at it, but was unable to 
discern any clear shape, and suddenly gasped in alarm as the aircraft 
dipped sharply and headed downwards in what seemed certain to be 
a collision course. Their relative velocity seemed unbelievable, and 
Arthur had hardly time to draw breath before it was all over. The next 
thing he was aware of was an insane silver blur that seemed to 
surround him. He twisted his head sharply round and saw a small 
black point dwindling rapidly in the distance behind them, and it took 
him several seconds to realize what had happened. 

They had plunged into a tunnel in the ground. The colossal speed 
had been their own relative to the glow of light which was a 
stationary hole in the ground, the mouth of the tunnel. The insane 
blur of silver was the circular wall of the tunnel down which they 
were shooting, apparently at several hundred miles an hour. 

He closed his eyes in terror. 

After a length of time which he made no attempt to judge, he 
sensed a slight subsidence in their speed and some while later 
became aware that they were gradually gliding to a gentle halt. 



He opened his eyes again. They were still in the silver tunnel, 
threading and weaving their way through what appeared to be a 
crisscross warren of converging tunnels. When they finally stopped it 
was in a small chamber of curved steel. Several tunnels also had their 
terminus here, and at the farther end of the chamber Arthur could 
see a large circle of dim irritating light. It was irritating because it 
played tricks with the eyes, it was impossible to focus on it properly or 
tell how near or far it was. Arthur guessed (quite wrongly) that it 
might be ultra violet. 

Slartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old eyes. 

"Earthman," he said, "we are now deep in the heart of Magrathea." 

"How did you know I was an Earthman?" demanded Arthur. 

"These things will become clear to you," said the old man gently, 

"at least," he added with slight doubt in his voice, "clearer than they 
are at the moment." 

He continued: "I should warn you that the chamber we are about 
to pass into does not literally exist within our planet. It is a little too... 
large. We are about to pass through a gateway into a vast tract of 
hyperspace. It may disturb you." 

Arthur made nervous noises. 

Slartibartfast touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly. 
"It scares the willies out of me. Hold tight." 

The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly 
Arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like. 

It wasn't infinity in fact. Infinity itself looks flat and uninteresting. 
Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity - distance is 
incomprehensible and therefore meaningless. The chamber into 
which the aircar emerged was anything but infinite, it was just very 
very big, so that it gave the impression of infinity far better than 
infinity itself. 

Arthur's senses bobbed and span, as, travelling at the immense 
speed he knew the aircar attained, they climbed slowly through the 
open air leaving the gateway through which they had passed an 
invisible pinprick in the shimmering wall behind them. 

The wall. 



The wall defied the imagination - seduced it and defeated it. The 
wall was so paralysingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and sides 
passed away beyond the reach of sight. The mere shock of vertigo 
could kill a man. 

The wall appeared perfectly flat. It would take the finest laser 
measuring equipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to 
infinity, as it dropped dizzily away, as it planed out to either side, it 
also curved. It met itself again thirteen light seconds away. In other 
words the wall formed the inside of a hollow sphere, a sphere over 
three million miles across and flooded with unimaginable light. 

"Welcome," said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, 
travelling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly 
forward into the mindboggling space, "welcome," he said, "to our 
factory floor." 

Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror. Ranged 
away before them, at distances he could neither judge nor even guess 
at, were a series of curious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal 
and light hung about shadowy spherical shapes that hung in the space. 

"This," said Slartibartfast, "is where we make most of our planets 
you see." 

"You mean," said Arthur, trying to form the words, "you mean 
you're starting it all up again now?" 

"No no, good heavens no," exclaimed the old man, "no, the Galaxy 
isn't nearly rich enough to support us yet. No, we've been awakened 
to perform just one extraordinary commission for very... special 
clients from another dimension. It may interest you... there in the 
distance in front of us." 

Arthur followed the old man's finger, till he was able to pick out the 
floating structure he was pointing out. It was indeed the only one of 
the many structures that betrayed any sign of activity about it, though 
this was more a sublimal impression than anything one could put 
one's finger on. 

At the moment however a flash of light arced through the structure 
and revealed in stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark 
sphere within. Patterns that Arthur knew, rough blobby shapes that 
were as familiar to him as the shapes of words, part of the furniture 
of his mind. For a few seconds he sat in stunned silence as the images 



rushed around his mind and tried to find somewhere to settle down 
and make sense. 

Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was 
looking at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite 
sensibly refused to countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility 
for any further thinking in that direction. 

The flash came again, and this time there could be no doubt. 

"The Earth..." whispered Arthur. 

"Well, the Earth Mark Two in fact," said Slartibartfast cheerfully. 
"We're making a copy from our original blueprints." 

There was a pause. 

"Are you trying to tell me," said Arthur, slowly and with control, 
"that you originally... made the Earth?" 

"Oh yes," said Slartibartfast. "Did you ever go to a place... I think it 
was called Norway?" 

"No," said Arthur, "no, I didn't." 

"Pity," said Slartibartfast, "that was one of mine. Won an award 
you know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was most upset to hear about its 
destruction." 

"You were upset!" 

"Yes. Five minutes later and it wouldn't have mattered so much. It 
was a quite shocking cock-up." 

"Huh?" said Arthur. 

"The mice were furious." 

"The mice were furious?" 

"Oh yes," said the old man mildly. 

"Yes well so I expect were the dogs and cats and duckbilled 
platypuses, but..." 

"Ah, but they hadn't paid for it you see, had they?" 

"Look," said Arthur, "would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up 
and went mad now?" 

For a while the aircar flew on in awkward silence. Then the old man 
tried patiently to explain. 

"Earthman, the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, 
and run by mice. It was destroyed five minutes before the completion 



of the purpose for which it was built, and we've got to build another 
one." 

Only one word registered with Arthur. 

"Mice?" he said. 

"Indeed Earthman." 

"Look, sorry - are we talking about the little white furry things with 
the cheese fixation and women standing on tables screaming in early 
sixties sit corns?" 

Slartibartfast coughed politely. 

"Earthman," he said, "it is sometimes hard to follow your mode of 
speech. Remember I have been asleep inside this planet of Magrathea 
for five million years and know little of these early sixties sit corns of 
which you speak. These creatures you call mice, you see, they are not 
quite as they appear. They are merely the protrusion into our 
dimension of vast hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings. The whole 
business with the cheese and the squeaking is just a front." 

The old man paused, and with a sympathetic frown continued. 

"They've been experimenting on you I'm afraid." 

Arthur thought about this for a second, and then his face cleared. 

"Ah no," he said, "I see the source of the misunderstanding now. 

No, look you see, what happened was that we used to do 
experiments on them. They were often used in behavioural research, 
Pavlov and all that sort of stuff. So what happened was hat the mice 
would be set all sorts of tests, learning to ring bells, run around mazes 
and things so that the whole nature of the learning process could be 
examined. From our observations of their behaviour we were able to 
learn all sorts of things about our own..." 

Arthur's voice tailed off. 

"Such subtlety..." said Slartibartfast, "one has to admire it." 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"How better to disguise their real natures, and how better to guide 
your thinking. Suddenly running down a maze the wrong way, eating 
the wrong bit of cheese, unexpectedly dropping dead of myxomatosis, 
- if it's finely calculated the cumulative effect is enormous." 

He paused for effect. 



"You see, Earthman, they really are particularly clever 
hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings. Your planet and people have 
formed the matrix of an organic computer running a ten-million-year 
research programme... 

"Let me tell you the whole story. It'll take a little time." 

"Time," said Arthur weakly, "is not currently one of my problems." 



Chapter 25 


There are of course many problems connected with life, of which 
some of the most popular are Why are people born? Why do they die? 
Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing 
digital watches? 

Many many millions of years ago a race of hyperintelligent pan¬ 
dimensional beings (whose physical manifestation in their own pan¬ 
dimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed up with 
the constant bickering about the meaning of life which used to 
interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockian Ultra Cricket (a curious 
game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily apparent 
reason and then running away) that they decided to sit down and 
solve their problems once and for all. 

And to this end they built themselves a stupendous super 
computer which was so amazingly intelligent that even before the 
data banks had been connected up it had started from I think 
therefore I am and got as far as the existence of rice pudding and 
income tax before anyone managed to turn it off. 

It was the size of a small city. 

Its main console was installed in a specially designed executive 
office, mounted on an enormous executive desk of finest 
ultramahagony topped with rich ultrared leather. The dark carpeting 
was discreetly sumptuous, exotic pot plants and tastefully engraved 
prints of the principal computer programmers and their families were 
deployed liberally about the room, and stately windows looked out 
upon a tree-lined public square. 

On the day of the Great On-Turning two soberly dressed 
programmers with brief cases arrived and were shown discreetly into 
the office. They were aware that this day they would represent their 
entire race in its greatest moment, but they conducted themselves 
calmly and quietly as they seated themselves deferentially before the 



desk, opened their brief cases and took out their leather-bound 
notebooks. 

Their names were Lunkwill and Fook. 

For a few moments they sat in respectful silence, then, after 
exchanging a quiet glance with Fook, Lunkwill leaned forward and 
touched a small black panel. 

The subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now 
in total active mode. After a pause it spoke to them in a voice rich 
resonant and deep. 

It said: "What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the 
second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space have 
been called into existence?" 

Lunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise. 

"Your task, O Computer..." began Fook. 

"No, wait a minute, this isn't right," said Lunkwill, worried. "We 
distinctly designed this computer to be the greatest one ever and 
we're not making do with second best. Deep Thought," he addressed 
the computer, "are you not as we designed you to be, the greatest 
most powerful computer in all time?" 

"I described myself as the second greatest," intoned Deep Thought, 
"and such I am." 

Another worried look passed between the two programmers. 
Lunkwill cleared his throat. 

"There must be some mistake," he said, "are you not a greatest 
computer than the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the 
atoms in a star in a millisecond?" 

"The Milliard Gargantubrain?" said Deep Thought with 
unconcealed contempt. "A mere abacus - mention it not." 

"And are you not," said Fook leaning anxiously forward, "a greater 
analyst than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of 
Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single 
dust particle throughout a five-week Dangrabad Beta sand blizzard?" 

"A five-week sand blizzard?" said Deep Thought haughtily. "You ask 
this of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in 
the Big Bang itself? Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff." 

The two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment. 
Then Lunkwill leaned forward again. 



"But are you not," he said, "a more fiendish disputant than the 
Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus 12, 
the Magic and Indefatigable?" 

"The Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler," said 
Deep Thought thoroughly rolling the r's, "could talk all four legs off an 
Arcturan MegaDonkey - but only I could persuade it to go for a walk 
afterwards." 

"Then what," asked Fook, "is the problem?" 

"There is no problem," said Deep Thought with magnificent ringing 
tones. "I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe of 
Space and Time." 

"But the second?" insisted Lunkwill. "Why do you keep saying the 
second? You're surely not thinking of the Multicorticoid Perspicutron 
Titan Muller are you? Or the Pondermatic? Or the..." 

Contemptuous lights flashed across the computer's console. 

"I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic 
simpletons!" he boomed. "I speak of none but the computer that is to 
come after me!" 

Fook was losing patience. He pushed his notebook aside and 
muttered, "I think this is getting needlessly messianic." 

"You know nothing of future time," pronounced Deep Thought, 
"and yet in my teeming circuitry I can navigate the infinite delta 
streams of future probability and see that there must one day come a 
computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to 
calculate, but which it will be my fate eventually to design." 

Fook sighed heavily and glanced across to Lunkwill. 

"Can we get on and ask the question?" he said. 

Lunkwill motioned him to wait. 

"What computer is this of which you speak?" he asked. 

"I will speak of it no further in this present time," said Deep 
Thought. "Now. Ask what else of me you will that I may function. 
Speak." 

They shrugged at each other. Fook composed himself. 

"O Deep Thought Computer," he said, "the task we have designed 
you to perform is this. We want you to tell us..." he paused,"... the 
Answer!" 



"The answer?" said Deep Thought. "The answer to what?" 

"Life!" urged Fook. 

"The Universe!" said Lunkwill. 

"Everything!" they said in chorus. 

Deep Thought paused for a moment's reflection. 

"Tricky," he said finally. 

"But can you do it?" 

Again, a significant pause. 

"Yes," said Deep Thought, "I can do it." 

"There is an answer?" said Fook with breathless excitement." 

"A simple answer?" added Lunkwill. 

"Yes," said Deep Thought. "Life, the Universe, and Everything. 

There is an answer. But," he added, "I'll have to think about it." 

A sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door flew open 
and two angry men wearing the coarse faded - blue robes and belts 
of the Cruxwan University burst into the room, thrusting aside the 
ineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their way. 

"We demand admission!" shouted the younger of the two men 
elbowing a pretty young secretary in the throat. 

"Come on," shouted the older one, "you can't keep us out!" He 
pushed a junior programmer back through the door. 

"We demand that you can't keep us out!" bawled the younger one, 
though he was now firmly inside the room and no further attempts 
were being made to stop him. 

"Who are you?" said Lunkwill, rising angrily from his seat. "What do 
you want?" 

"I am Majikthise!" announced the older one. 

"And I demand that I am Vroomfondel!" shouted the younger one. 

Majikthise turned on Vroomfondel. "It's alright," he explained 
angrily, "you don't need to demand that." 

"Alright!" bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby desk. "I am 
Vroomfondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact! What we 
demand is solid facts!" 

"No we don't!" exclaimed Majikthise in irritation. "That is precisely 
what we don't demand!" 



Scarcely pausing for breath, Vroomfondel shouted, "We don't 
demand solid facts! What we demand is a total absence of solid facts. 

I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondel!" 

"But who the devil are you?" exclaimed an outraged Fook. 

"We," said Majikthise, "are Philosophers." 

"Though we may not be," said Vroomfondel waving a warning 
finger at the programmers. 

"Yes we are," insisted Majikthise. "We are quite definitely here as 
representatives of the Amalgamated Union of Philosophers, Sages, 
Luminaries and Other Thinking Persons, and we want this machine off, 
and we want it off now!" 

"What's the problem?" said Lunkwill. 

"I'll tell you what the problem is mate," said Majikthise, 
"demarcation, that's the problem!" 

"We demand," yelled Vroomfondel, "that demarcation may or may 
not be the problem!" 

"You just let the machines get on with the adding up," warned 
Majikthise, "and we'll take care of the eternal verities thank you very 
much. You want to check your legal position you do mate. Under law 
the Quest for Ultimate Truth is quite clearly the inalienable 
prerogative of your working thinkers. Any bloody machine goes and 
actually finds it and we're straight out of a job aren't we? I mean 
what's the use of our sitting up half the night arguing that there may 
or may not be a God if this machine only goes and gives us his 
bleeding phone number the next morning?" 

"That's right!" shouted Vroomfondel, "we demand rigidly defined 
areas of doubt and uncertainty!" 

Suddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the room. 

"Might I make an observation at this point?" inquired Deep 
Thought. 

"We'll go on strike!" yelled Vroomfondel. 

"That's right!" agreed Majikthise. "You'll have a national 
Philosopher's strike on your hands!" 

The hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary 
bass driver units, mounted in sedately carved and varnished cabinet 
speakers around the room, cut in to give Deep Thought's voice a little 
more power. 



"All I wanted to say," bellowed the computer, "is that my circuits 
are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the 
Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything - " he paused 
and satisfied himself that he now had everyone's attention, before 
continuing more quietly, "but the programme will take me a little 
while to run." 

Fook glanced impatiently at his watch. 

"How long?" he said. 

"Seven and a half million years," said Deep Thought. 

Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other. 

"Seven and a half million years...!" they cried in chorus. 

"Yes," declaimed Deep Thought, "I said I'd have to think about it, 
didn't I? And it occurs to me that running a programme like this is 
bound to create an enormous amount of popular publicity for the 
whole area of philosophy in general. Everyone's going to have their 
own theories about what answer I'm eventually to come up with, and 
who better to capitalize on that media market than you yourself? So 
long as you can keep disagreeing with each other violently enough 
and slagging each other off in the popular press, you can keep 
yourself on the gravy train for life. How does that sound?" 

The two philosophers gaped at him. 

"Bloody hell," said Majikthise, "now that is what I call thinking. 
Here Vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like that?" 

"Dunno," said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper, "think our brains 
must be too highly trained Majikthise." 

So saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the door 
and into a lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams. 



Chapter 26 


"Yes, very salutary," said Arthur, after Slartibartfast had related the 
salient points of the story to him, "but I don't understand what all this 
has got to do with the Earth and mice and things." 

"That is but the first half of the story Earthman," said the old man. 
"If you would care to discover what happened seven and a half 
millions later, on the great day of the Answer, allow me to invite you 
to my study where you can experience the events yourself on our 
Sens-O-Tape records. That is unless you would care to take a quick 
stroll on the surface of New Earth. It's only half completed I'm afraid - 
we haven't even finished burying the artificial dinosaur skeletons in 
the crust yet, then we have the Tertiary and Quarternary Periods of 
the Cenozoic Era to lay down, and..." 

"No thank you," said Arthur, "it wouldn't be quite the same." 

"No," said Slartibartfast, "it won't be," and he turned the aircar 
round and headed back towards the mind-numbing wall. 



Chapter 27 


Slartibartfast's study was a total mess, like the results of an 
explosion in a public library. The old man frowned as they stepped in. 

"Terribly unfortunate," he said, "a diode blew in one of the life- 
support computers. When we tried to revive our cleaning staff we 
discovered they'd been dead for nearly thirty thousand years. Who's 
going to clear away the bodies, that's what I want to know. Look why 
don't you sit yourself down over there and let me plug you in?" 

He gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been 
made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus. 

"It was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus," explained the 
old man as he pottered about fishing bits of wire out from under 
tottering piles of paper and drawing instruments. "Here," he said, 
"hold these," and passed a couple of stripped wire end to Arthur. 

The instant he took hold of them a bird flew straight through him. 

He was suspended in mid-air and totally invisible to himself. 
Beneath him was a pretty treelined city square, and all around it as 
far as the eye could see were white concrete buildings of airy 
spacious design but somewhat the worse for wear - many were 
cracked and stained with rain. Today however the sun was shining, a 
fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd sensation 
that all the buildings were quietly humming was probably caused by 
the fact that the square and all the streets around it were thronged 
with cheerful excited people. Somewhere a band was playing, brightly 
coloured flags were fluttering in the breeze and the spirit of carnival 
was in the air. 

Arthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air above it all 
without so much as a body to his name, but before he had time to 
reflect on this a voice rang out across the square and called for 
everyone's attention. 



A man standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building 
which clearly dominated the square was addressing the crowd over a 
Tannoy. 

"O people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought!" he cried out. 
"Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest 
and Most Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe has ever known... The 
Time of Waiting is over!" 

Wild cheers broke out amongst the crowd. Flags, streamers and 
wolf whistles sailed through the air. The narrower streets looked 
rather like centipedes rolled over on their backs and frantically waving 
their legs in the air. 

"Seven and a half million years our race has waited for this Great 
and Hopefully Enlightening Day!" cried the cheer leader. "The Day of 
the Answer!" 

Hurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd. 

"Never again," cried the man, "never again will we wake up in the 
morning and think Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it 
really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to work? 

For today we will finally learn once and for all the plain and simple 
answer to all these nagging little problems of Life, the Universe and 
Everything!" 

As the crowd erupted once again, Arthur found himself gliding 
through the air and down towards one of the large stately windows 
on the first floor of the building behind the dais from which the 
speaker was addressing the crowd. 

He experienced a moment's panic as he sailed straight through 
towards the window, which passed when a second or so later he 
found he had gone right through the solid glass without apparently 
touching it. 

No one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is 
hardly surprising as he wasn't there. He began to realize that the 
whole experience was merely a recorded projection which knocked 
six-track seventy-millimetre into a cocked hat. 

The room was much as Slartibartfast had described it. In seven and 
a half million years it had been well looked after and cleaned regularly 
every century or so. The ultramahagony desk was worn at the edges, 
the carpet a little faded now, but the large computer terminal sat in 



sparkling glory on the desk's leather top, as bright as if it had been 
constructed yesterday. 

Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and 
waited. 

"The time is nearly upon us," said one, and Arthur was surprised to 
see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man's neck. The 
word was Loonquawl, and it flashed a couple of times and the 
disappeared again. Before Arthur was able to assimilate this the other 
man spoke and the word Phouchg appeared by his neck. 

"Seventy-five thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this 
program in motion," the second man said, "and in all that time we will 
be the first to hear the computer speak." 

"An awesome prospect, Phouchg," agreed the first man, and Arthur 
suddenly realized that he was watching a recording with subtitles. 

"We are the ones who will hear," said Phouchg, "the answer to the 
great question of Life...!" 

"The Universe...!" said Loonquawl. 

"And Everything...!" 

"Shhh," said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, "I think Deep Thought 
is preparing to speak!" 

There was a moment's expectant pause whilst panels slowly came 
to life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off 
experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern. A soft 
low hum came from the communication channel. 

"Good morning," said Deep Thought at last. 

"Er... Good morning, O Deep Thought," said Loonquawl nervously, 
"do you have... er, that is..." 

"An answer for you?" interrupted Deep Thought majestically. "Yes. 

I have." 

The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been 
in vain. 

"There really is one?" breathed Phouchg. 

"There really is one," confirmed Deep Thought. 

"To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and 
Everything?" 

"Yes." 



Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had 
been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those 
who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves 
gasping and squirming like excited children. 

"And you're ready to give it to us?" urged Loonquawl. 

"I am." 

"Now?" 

"Now," said Deep Thought. 

They both licked their dry lips. 

"Though I don't think," added Deep Thought, "that you're going to 
like it." 

"Doesn't matter!" said Phouchg. "We must know it! Now!" 

"Now?" inquired Deep Thought. 

"Yes! Now..." 

"Alright," said the computer and settled into silence again. The two 
men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable. 

"You're really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought. 

"Tell us!" 

"Alright," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the Great 
Question..." 

"Yes...!" 

"Of Life, the Universe and Everything..." said Deep Thought. 
"Yes...!" 

"Is..." said Deep Thought, and paused. 

"Yes...!" 

"Is..." 

"Yes...!!!...?" 

"Forty-two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm. 




Chapter 28 


It was a long time before anyone spoke. 

Out of the corner of his eye Phouchg could see the sea of tense 
expectant faces down in the square outside. 

"We're going to get lynched aren't we?" he whispered. 

"It was a tough assignment," said Deep Thought mildly. 

"Forty-two!" yelled Loonquawl. "Is that all you've got to show for 
seven and a half million years' work?" 

"I checked it very thoroughly," said the computer, "and that quite 
definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with 
you, is that you've never actually known what the question is." 

"But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the 
Universe and Everything!" howled Loonquawl. 

"Yes," said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools 
gladly, "but what actually is it?" 

A slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the 
computer and then at each other. 

"Well, you know, it's just Everything... Everything..." offered 
Phouchg weakly. 

"Exactly!" said Deep Thought. "So once you do know what the 
question actually is, you'll know what the answer means." 

"Oh terrific," muttered Phouchg flinging aside his notebook and 
wiping away a tiny tear. 

"Look, alright, alright," said Loonquawl, "can you just please tell us 
the Question?" 

"The Ultimate Question?" 

"Yes!" 

"Of Life, the Universe, and Everything?" 

"Yes!" 

Deep Thought pondered this for a moment. 



"Tricky," he said. 

"But can you do it?" cried Loonquawl. 

Deep Thought pondered this for another long moment. 

Finally: "No," he said firmly. 

Both men collapsed on to their chairs in despair. 

"But I'll tell you who can," said Deep Thought. 

They both looked up sharply. 

"Who?" "Tell us!" 

Suddenly Arthur began to feel his apparently non-existent scalp 
begin to crawl as he found himself moving slowly but inexorably 
forward towards the console, but it was only a dramatic zoom on the 
part of whoever had made the recording he assumed. 

"I speak of none other than the computer that is to come after 
me," intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed 
declamatory tones. "A computer whose merest operational 
parameters I am not worthy to calculate - and yet I will design it for 
you. A computer which can calculate the Question to the Ultimate 
Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that 
organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix. And you 
yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to 
navigate its ten-million-year program! Yes! I shall design this 
computer for you. And I shall name it also unto you. And it shall be 
called... The Earth." 

Phouchg gaped at Deep Thought. 

"What a dull name," he said and great incisions appeared down the 
length of his body. Loonquawl too suddenly sustained horrific gashed 
from nowhere. The Computer console blotched and cracked, the walls 
flickered and crumbled and the room crashed upwards into its own 
ceiling... 

Slartibartfast was standing in front of Arthur holding the two wires. 

"End of the tape," he explained. 



Chapter 29 


"Zaphod! Wake up!" 

"Mmmmmwwwwwerrrrr?" 

"Hey come on, wake up." 

"Just let me stick to what I'm good at, yeah?" muttered Zaphod and 
rolled away from the voice back to sleep. 

"Do you want me to kick you?" said Ford. 

"Would it give you a lot of pleasure?" said Zaphod, blearily. 

"No." 

"Nor me. So what's the point? Stop bugging me." Zaphod curled 
himself up. 

"He got a double dose of the gas," said Trillian looking down at him, 
"two windpipes." 

"And stop talking," said Zaphod, "it's hard enough trying to sleep 
anyway. What's the matter with the ground? It's all cold and hard." 

"It's gold," said Ford. 

With an amazingly balletic movement Zaphod was standing and 
scanning the horizon, because that was how far the gold ground 
stretched in every direction, perfectly smooth and solid. It gleamed 
like... it's impossible to say what it gleamed like because nothing in 
the Universe gleams in quite the same way that a planet of solid gold 
does. 

"Who put all that there?" yelped Zaphod, goggle-eyed. 

"Don't get excited," said Ford, "it's only a catalogue." 

"A who?" 

"A catalogue," said Trillian, "an illusion." 

"How can you say that?" cried Zaphod, falling to his hands and 
knees and staring at the ground. He poked it and prodded it with his 
fingernail. It was very heavy and very slightly soft - he could mark it 
with his fingernail. It was very yellow and very shiny, and when he 



breathed on it his breath evaporated off it in that very peculiar and 
special way that breath evaporates off solid gold. 

"Trillian and I came round a while ago," said Ford. "We shouted 
and yelled till somebody came and then carried on shouting and 
yelling till they got fed up and put us in their planet catalogue to keep 
us busy till they were ready to deal with us. This is all Sens-O-Tape." 

Zaphod stared at him bitterly. 

"Ah, shit," he said, "you wake me up from my own perfectly good 
dream to show me somebody else's." He sat down in a huff. 

"What's that series of valleys over there?" he said. 

"Hallmark," said Ford. "We had a look." 

"We didn't wake you earlier," said Trillian. "The last planet was 
knee deep in fish." 

"Fish?" 

"Some people like the oddest things." 

"And before that," said Ford, "we had platinum. Bit dull. We 
thought you'd like to see this one though." 

Seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they looked. 

"Very pretty," said Zaphod petulantly. 

In the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared. It flickered 
and changed, and when they looked around again so had the land. 

As with one voice they all went, "Yuch." 

The sea was purple. The beach they were on was composed of tiny 
yellow and green pebbles - presumably terribly precious stones. The 
mountains in the distance seemed soft and undulating with red peaks. 
Nearby stood a solid silver beach table with a frilly mauve parasol and 
silver tassles. 

In the sky a huge sign appeared, replacing the catalogue number. It 
said, Whatever your tastes, Magrathea can cater for you. We are not 
proud. 

And five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the sky on 
parachutes. 

In a moment the scene vanished and left them in a springtime 
meadow full of cows. 

"Ow!" said Zaphod. "My brains!" 

"You want to talk about it?" said Ford. 



"Yeah, OK," said Zaphod, and all three sat down and ignored the 
scenes that came and went around them. 

"I figure this," said Zaphod. "Whatever happened to my mind, I did 
it. And I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the 
government screening tests. And I wasn't to know anything about it 
myself. Pretty crazy, right?" 

The other two nodded in agreement. 

"So I reckon, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know 
it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is I 
don't know. Obviously. But I put a few things together and I can begin 
to guess. When did I decide to run for President? Shortly after the 
death of President Yooden Vranx. You remember Yooden, Ford?" 

"Yeah," said Ford, "he was that guy we met when we were kids, the 
Arcturan captain. Fie was a gas. Fie gave us conkers when you bust 
your way into his megafreighter. Said you were the most amazing kid 
he'd ever met." 

"What's all this?" said Trillian. 

"Ancient history," said Ford, "when we were kids together on 
Betelgeuse. The Arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of the 
bulky trade between the Galactic Centre and the outlying regions The 
Betelgeuse trading scouts used to find the markets and the Arcturans 
would supply them. There was a lot of trouble with space pirates 
before they were wiped out in the Dordellis wars, and the 
megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic defence 
shields known to Galactic science. They were real brutes of ships, and 
huge. In orbit round a planet they would eclipse the sun. 

"One day, young Zaphod here decides to raid one. On a tri-jet 
scooter designed for stratosphere work, a mere kid. I mean forget it, 
it was crazier than a mad monkey. I went along for the ride because 
I'd got some very safe money on him not doing it, and didn't want him 
coming back with fake evidence. So what happens? We got in his tri¬ 
jet which he had souped up into something totally other, crossed 
three parsecs in a matter of weeks, bust our way into a megafreighter 
I still don't know how, marched on to the bridge waving toy pistols 
and demanded conkers. A wilder thing I have not known. Lost me a 
year's pocket money. For what? Conkers." 

"The captain was this really amazing guy, Yooden Vranx," said 
Zaphod. "Fie gave us food, booze - stuff from really weird parts of the 



Galaxy - lots of conkers of course, and we had just the most 
incredible time. Then he teleported us back. Into the maximum 
security wing of Betelgeuse state prison. He was a cool guy. Went on 
to become President of the Galaxy." 

Zaphod paused. 

The scene around them was currently plunged into gloom. Dark 
mists swirled round them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly 
in the shadows. The air was occasionally rent with the sounds of 
illusory beings murdering other illusory beings. Presumably enough 
people must have liked this sort of thing to make it a paying 
proposition. 

"Ford," said Zaphod quietly. 

"Yeah?" 

"Just before Yooden died he came to see me." 

"What? You never told me." 

"No." 

"What did he say? What did he come to see you about?" 

"He told me about the Heart of Gold. It was his idea that I should 
steal it." 

"His idea?" 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "and the only possible way of stealing it was 
to be at the launching ceremony." 

Ford gaped at him in astonishment for a moment, and then roared 
with laughter. 

"Are you telling me," he said, "that you set yourself up to become 
President of the Galaxy just to steal that ship?" 

"That's it," said Zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most 
people locked away in a room with soft walls. 

"But why?" said Ford. "What's so important about having it?" 

"Dunno," said Zaphod, "I think if I'd consciously known what was so 
important about it and what I would need it for it would have showed 
up on the brain screening tests and I would never have passed. I think 
Yooden told me a lot of things that are still locked away." 

"So you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as 
a result of Yooden talking to you?" 

"He was a hell of a talker." 



"Yeah, but Zaphod old mate, you want to look after yourself you 
know." 

Zaphod shrugged. 

"I mean, don't you have any inkling of the reasons for all this?" 
asked Ford. 

Zaphod thought hard about this and doubts seemed to cross his 
minds. 

"No," he said at last, "I don't seem to be letting myself into any of 
my secrets. Still," he added on further reflection, "I can understand 
that. I wouldn't trust myself further than I could spit a rat." 

A moment later, the last planet in the catalogue vanished from 
beneath them and the solid world resolved itself again. 

They were sitting in a plush waiting room full of glass-top tables 
and design awards. 

A tall Magrathean man was standing in front of them. 

"The mice will see you now," he said. 



Chapter 30 


"So there you have it," said Slartibartfast, making a feeble and 
perfunctory attempt to clear away some of the appalling mess of his 
study. He picked up a paper from the top of a pile, but then couldn't 
think of anywhere else to put it, so he but it back on top of the 
original pile which promptly fell over. "Deep Thought designed the 
Earth, we built it and you lived on it." 

"And the Vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before the 
program was completed," added Arthur, not unbitterly. 

"Yes," said the old man, pausing to gaze hopelessly round the room. 
"Ten million years of planning and work gone just like that. Ten 
million years, Earthman... can you conceive of that kind of time span? 
A galactic civilization could grow from a single worm five times over in 
that time. Gone." He paused. 

"Well that's bureaucracy for you," he added. 

"You know," said Arthur thoughtfully, "all this explains a lot of 
things. All through my life I've had this strange unaccountable feeling 
that something was going on in the world, something big, even 
sinister, and no one would tell me what it was." 

"No," said the old man, "that's just perfectly normal paranoia. 
Everyone in the Universe has that." 

"Everyone?" said Arthur. "Well, if everyone has that perhaps it 
means something! Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we 
know..." 

"Maybe. Who cares?" said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too 
excited. "Perhaps I'm old and tired," he continued, "but I always think 
that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly 
remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just 
keep yourself occupied. Look at me: I design coastlines. I got an award 
for Norway." 



He rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large 
perspex block with his name on it and a model of Norway moulded 
into it. 

"Where's the sense in that?" he said. "None that I've been able to 
make out. I've been doing fjords in all my life. For a fleeting moment 
they become fashionable and I get a major award." 

He turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed it aside 
carelessly, but not so carelessly that it didn't land on something soft. 

"In this replacement Earth we're building they've given me Africa to 
do and of course I'm doing it with all fjords again because I happen to 
like them, and I'm old fashioned enough to think that they give a 
lovely baroque feel to a continent. And they tell me it's not equatorial 
enough. Equatorial!" He gave a hollow laugh. "What does it matter? 
Science has achieved some wonderful things of course, but I'd far 
rather be happy than right any day." 

"And are you?" 

"No. That's where it all falls down of course." 

"Pity," said Arthur with sympathy. "It sounded like quite a good 
lifestyle otherwise." 

Somewhere on the wall a small white light flashed. 

"Come," said Slartibartfast, "you are to meet the mice. Your arrival 
on the planet has caused considerable excitement. It has already 
been hailed, so I gather, as the third most improbable event in the 
history of the Universe." 

"What were the first two?" 

"Oh, probably just coincidences," said Slartibartfast carelessly. He 
opened the door and stood waiting for Arthur to follow. 

Arthur glanced around him once more, and then down at himself, 
at the sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in on 
Thursday morning. 

"I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," he 
muttered to himself. 

"I beg your pardon?" said the old man mildly. 

"Oh nothing," said Arthur, "only joking." 



Chapter 31 


It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full 
scale of the problem is not always appreciated. 

For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said "I seem to be 
having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," a freak wormhole 
opened up in the fabric of the space-time continuum and carried his 
words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a 
distant Galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the 
brink of frightful interstellar battle. 

The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time. 

A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the 
commander of the Vl'hurgs, resplendent in his black jewelled battle 
shorts, gazed levelly at the G'Gugvuntt leader squatting opposite him 
in a cloud of green sweet-smelling steam, and, with a million sleek 
and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to unleash electric 
death at his single word of command, challenged the vile creature to 
take back what it had said about his mother. 

The creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that very 
moment the words I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my 
lifestyle drifted across the conference table. 

Unfortunately, in the Vl'hurg tongue this was the most dreadful 
insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible 
war for centuries. 

Eventually of course, after their Galaxy had been decimated over a 
few thousand years, it was realized that the whole thing had been a 
ghastly mistake, and so the two opposing battle fleets settled their 
few remaining differences in order to launch a joint attack on our own 
Galaxy - now positively identified as the source of the offending 
remark. 

For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty 
wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first planet they 
came across - which happened to be the Earth - where due to a 



terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally 
swallowed by a small dog. 

Those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the 
history of the Universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the 
time, but that we are powerless to prevent it. 

"It's just life," they say. 

A short aircar trip brought Arthur and the old Magrathean to a 
doorway. They left the car and went through the door into a waiting 
room full of glass-topped tables and perspex awards. Almost 
immediately, a light flashed above the door at the other side of the 
room and they entered. 

"Arthur! You're safe!" a voice cried. 

"Am I?" said Arthur, rather startled. "Oh good." 

The lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so to 
see Ford, Trillian and Zaphod sitting round a large table beautifully 
decked out with exotic dishes, strange sweetmeats and bizarre fruits. 
They were stuffing their faces. 

"What happened to you?" demanded Arthur. 

"Well," said Zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, "our 
hosts here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being 
generally weird and have now given us a rather nice meal to make it 
up to us. Here," he said hoiking out a lump of evil smelling meat from 
a bowl, "have some Vegan Rhino's cutlet. It's delicious if you happen 
to like that sort of thing." 

"Hosts?" said Arthur. "What hosts? I don't see any..." 

A small voice said, "Welcome to lunch. Earth creature." 

Arthur glanced around and suddenly yelped. 

"Ugh!" he said. "There are mice on the table!" 

There was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at 
Arthur. 

He was busy staring at two white mice sitting in what looked like 
whisky glasses on the table. He heard the silence and glanced around 
at everyone. 

"Oh!" he said, with sudden realization. "Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't quite 
prepared for..." 



"Let me introduce you," said Trillian. "Arthur this is Benji mouse." 

"Hi," said one of the mice. His whiskers stroked what must have 
been a touch sensitive panel on the inside of the whisky-glass like 
affair, and it moved forward slightly. 

"And this is Frankie mouse." 

The other mouse said, "Pleased to meet you," and did likewise. 

Arthur gaped. 

"But aren't they..." 

"Yes," said Trillian, "they are the mice I brought with me from the 
Earth." 

She looked him in the eye and Arthur thought he detected the 
tiniest resigned shrug. 

"Could you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Mega don key?" 
she said. 

Slartibartfast coughed politely. 

"Er, excuse me," he said. 

"Yes, thank you Slartibartfast," said Benji mouse sharply, "you may 
go." 

"What? Oh... er, very well," said the old man, slightly taken aback, 
"Nl just go and get on with some of my fjords then." 

"Ah, well in fact that won't be necessary," said Frankie mouse. "It 
looks very much as if we won't be needing the new Earth any longer." 
He swivelled his pink little eyes. "Not now that we have found a 
native of the planet who was there seconds before it was destroyed." 

"What?" cried Slartibartfast, aghast. "You can't mean that! I've got 
a thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over Africa!" 

"Well perhaps you can take a quick skiing holiday before you 
dismantle them," said Frankie, acidly. 

"Skiing holiday!" cried the old man. "Those glaciers are works of art! 
Elegantly sculptured contours, soaring pinnacles of ice, deep majestic 
ravines! It would be sacrilege to go skiing on high art!" 

"Thank you Slartibartfast," said Benji firmly. "That will be all." 

"Yes sir," said the old man coldly, "thank you very much. Well, 
goodbye Earthman," he said to Arthur, "hope the lifestyle comes 
together." 



With a brief nod to the rest of the company he turned and walked 
sadly out of the room. 

Arthur stared after him not knowing what to say. 

"Now," said Benji mouse, "to business." 

Ford and Zaphod clinked their glasses together. 

"To business!" they said. 

"I beg your pardon?" said Benji. 

Ford looked round. 

"Sorry, I thought you were proposing a toast," he said. 

The two mice scuttled impatiently around in their glass transports. 
Finally they composed themselves, and Benji moved forward to 
address Arthur. 

"Now, Earth creature," he said, "the situation we have in effect is 
this. We have, as you know, been more or less running your planet for 
the last ten million years in order to find this wretched thing called 
the Ultimate Question." 

"Why?" said Arthur, sharply. 

"No - we already thought of that one," said Frankie interrupting, 
"but it doesn't fit the answer. Why? Forty-Two... you see, it doesn't 
work." 

"No," said Arthur, "I mean why have you been doing it?" 

"Oh, I see," said Frankie. "Well, eventually just habit I think, to be 
brutally honest. And this is more or less the point - we're sick to the 
teeth with the whole thing, and the prospect of doing it all over again 
on account of those whinnet-ridden Vogons quite frankly gives me 
the screaming heeby jeebies, you know what I mean? It was by the 
merest lucky chance that Benji and I finished our particular job and 
left the planet early for a quick holiday, and have since manipulated 
our way back to Magrathea by the good offices of your friends." 

"Magrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension," put in Benji. 

"Since when," continued his murine colleague, "we have had an 
offer of a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D chat show and 
lecture circuit back in our own dimensional neck of the woods, and 
we're very much inclined to take it." 

"I would, wouldn't you Ford?" said Zaphod promptingly. 

"Oh yes," said Ford, "jump at it, like a shot." 



Arthur glanced at them, wondering what all this was leading up to. 

"But we've got to have a product you see," said Frankie, "I mean 
ideally we still need the Ultimate Question in some form or other." 

Zaphod leaned forward to Arthur. 

"You see," he said, "if they're just sitting there in the studio looking 
very relaxed and, you know, just mentioning that they happen to 
know the Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, and then 
eventually have to admit that in fact it's Forty-two, then the show's 
probably quite short. No follow-up, you see." 

"We have to have something that sounds good," said Benji. 

"Something that sounds good?" exclaimed Arthur. "An Ultimate 
Question that sounds good? From a couple of mice?" 

The mice bristled. 

"Well, I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes 
the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point I'm afraid 
where you begin to suspect that if there's any real truth, it's that the 
entire multi-dimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly 
being run by a bunch of maniacs. And if it comes to a choice between 
spending yet another ten million years finding that out, and on the 
other hand just taking the money and running, then I for one could do 
with the exercise," said Frankie. 

"But..." started Arthur, hopelessly. 

"Hey, will you get this, Earthman," interrupted Zaphod. "You are a 
last generation product of that computer matrix, right, and you were 
there right up to the moment your planet got the finger, yeah?" 

"Er..." 

"So your brain was an organic part of the penultimate 
configuration of the computer programme," said Ford, rather lucidly 
he thought. 

"Right?" said Zaphod. 

"Well," said Arthur doubtfully. He wasn't aware of ever having felt 
an organic part of anything. He had always seen this as one of his 
problems. 

"In other words," said Benji, steering his curious little vehicle right 
over to Arthur, "there's a good chance that the structure of the 
question is encoded in the structure of your brain - so we want to buy 
it off you." 



"What, the question?" said Arthur. 

"Yes," said Ford and Trillian. 

"For lots of money," said Zaphod. 

"No, no," said Frankie, "it's the brain we want to buy." 

"What!" 

"I thought you said you could just read his brain electronically," 
protested Ford. 

"Oh yes," said Frankie, "but we'd have to get it out first. It's got to 
be prepared." 

"Treated," said Benji. 

"Diced." 

"Thank you," shouted Arthur, tipping up his chair and backing away 
from the table in horror. 

"It could always be replaced," said Benji reasonably, "if you think 
it's important." 

"Yes, an electronic brain," said Frankie, "a simple one would 
suffice." 

"A simple one!" wailed Arthur. 

"Yeah," said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin, "you'd just have to 
program it to say What? and I don't understand and Where's the tea? 
who'd know the difference?" 

"What?" cried Arthur, backing away still further. 

"See what I mean?" said Zaphod and howled with pain because of 
something that Trillian did at that moment. 

"I'd notice the difference," said Arthur. 

"No you wouldn't," said Frankie mouse, "you'd be programmed not 
to." 

Ford made for the door. 

"Look, I'm sorry, mice old lads," he said. "I don't think we've got a 
deal." 

"I rather think we have to have a deal," said the mice in chorus, all 
the charm vanishing fro their piping little voices in an instant. With a 
tiny whining shriek their two glass transports lifted themselves off the 
table, and swung through the air towards Arthur, who stumbled 
further backwards into a blind corner, utterly unable to cope or think 
of anything. 



Trillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag him 
towards the door, which Ford and Zaphod were struggling to open, 
but Arthur was dead weight - he seemed hypnotized by the airborne 
rodents swooping towards him. 

She screamed at him, but he just gaped. 

With one more yank. Ford and Zaphod got the door open. On the 
other side of it was a small pack of rather ugly men who they could 
only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathea. Not only were they 
ugly themselves, but the medical equipment they carried with them 
was also far from pretty. They charged. 

So - Arthur was about to have his head cut open, Trillian was 
unable to help him, and Ford and Zaphod were about to be set upon 
by several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than 
they were. 

All in all it was extremely fortunate that at that moment every 
alarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting din. 



Chapter 32 


"Emergency! Emergency!" blared the klaxons throughout 
Magrathea. "Hostile ship has landed on planet. Armed intruders in 
section 8A. Defence stations, defence stations!" 

The two mice sniffed irritably round the fragments of their glass 
transports where they lay shattered on the floor. 

"Damnation," muttered Frankie mouse, "all that fuss over two 
pounds of Earthling brain." He scuttled round and about, his pink eyes 
flashing, his fine white coat bristling with static. 

"The only thing we can do now," said Benji, crouching and stroking 
his whiskers in thought, "is to try and fake a question, invent one that 
will sound plausible." 

"Difficult," said Frankie. He thought. "How about What's yellow and 
dangerous?" 

Benji considered this for a moment. 

"No, no good," he said. "Doesn't fit the answer." 

They sank into silence for a few seconds. 

"Alright," said Benji. "What do you get if you multiply six by 
seven?" 

"No, no, too literal, too factual," said Frankie, "wouldn't sustain the 
punters' interest." 

Again they thought. 

Then Frankie said: "Here's a thought. How many roads must a man 
walk down?" 

"Ah," said Benji. "Aha, now that does sound promising!" He rolled 
the phrase around a little. "Yes," he said, "that's excellent! Sounds 
very significant without actually tying you down to meaning anything 
at all. How many roads must a man walk down? Forty-two. Excellent, 
excellent, that'll fox 'em. Frankie baby, we are made!" 

They performed a scampering dance in their excitement. 



Near them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who had been 
hit about the head with some heavy design awards. 

Half a mile away, four figures pounded up a corridor looking for a 
way out. They emerged into a wide open-plan computer bay. They 
glanced about wildly. 

"Which way do you reckon Zaphod?" said Ford. 

"At a wild guess, I'd say down here," said Zaphod, running off down 
to the right between a computer bank and the wall. As the others 
started after him he was brought up short by a Kill-O-Zap energy bolt 
that cracked through the air inches in front of him and fried a small 
section of adjacent wall. 

A voice on a loud hailer said, "OK Beeblebrox, hold it right there. 
We've got you covered." 

"Cops!" hissed Zaphod, and span around in a crouch. "You want to 
try a guess at all. Ford?" 

"OK, this way," said Ford, and the four of them ran down a 
gangway between two computer banks. 

At the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and 
space-suited figure waving a vicious Kill-O-Zap gun. 

"We don't want to shoot you, Beeblebrox!" shouted the figure. 

"Suits me fine!" shouted Zaphod back and dived down a wide gap 
between two data process units. 

The others swerved in behind him. 

"There are two of them," said Trillian. "We're cornered." 

They squeezed themselves down in an angle between a large 
computer data bank and the wall. 

They held their breath and waited. 

Suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops 
opened fire on them simultaneously. 

"Hey, they're shooting at us," said Arthur, crouching in a tight ball, 
"I thought they said they didn't want to do that." 

"Yeah, I thought they said that," agreed Ford. 

Zaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous moment. 

"Hey," he said, "I thought you said you didn't want to shoot us!" 
and ducked again. 

They waited. 



After a moment a voice replied, "It isn't easy being a cop!" 

"What did he say?" whispered Ford in astonishment. 

"He said it isn't easy being a cop." 

"Well surely that's his problem isn't it?" 

"I'd have thought so." 

Ford shouted out, "Hey listen! I think we've got enough problems 
on our own having you shooting at us, so if you could avoid laying 
your problems on us as well, I think we'd all find it easier to cope!" 

Another pause, and then the loud hailer again. 

"Now see here, guy," said the voice on the loud hailer, "you're not 
dealing with any dumb two-bit trigger-pumping morons with low 
hairlines, little piggy eyes and no conversation, we're a couple of 
intelligent caring guys that you'd probably quite like if you met us 
socially! I don't go around gratuitously shooting people and then 
bragging about it afterwards in seedy space-rangers bars, like some 
cops I could mention! I go around shooting people gratuitously and 
then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend!" 

"And I write novels!" chimed in the other cop. "Though I haven't 
had any of them published yet, so I better warn you, I'm in a meeeean 
mood!" 

Ford's eyes popped halfway out of their sockets. "Who are these 
guys?" he said. 

"Dunno," said Zaphod, "I think I preferred it when they were 
shooting." 

"So are you going to come quietly," shouted one of the cops again, 
"or are you going to let us blast you out?" 

"Which would you prefer?" shouted Ford. 

A millisecond later the air about them started to fry again, as bolt 
after bolt of Kill-O-Zap hurled itself into the computer bank in front of 
them. 

The fusillade continued for several seconds at unbearable intensity. 

When it stopped, there were a few seconds of near quietness ad 
the echoes died away. 

"You still there?" called one of the cops. 

"Yes," they called back. 

"We didn't enjoy doing that at all," shouted the other cop. 



"We could tell," shouted Ford. 

"Now, listen to this, Beeblebrox, and you better listen good!" 

"Why?" shouted BackZaphod. 

"Because," shouted the cop, "it's going to be very intelligent, and 
quite interesting and humane! Now either you all give yourselves up 
now and let us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course 
because we are firmly opposed to needless violence, or we blow up 
this entire planet and possibly one or two others we noticed on our 
way out here!" 

"But that's crazy!" cried Trillian. "You wouldn't do that!" 

"Oh yes we would," shouted the cop, "wouldn't we?" he asked the 
other one. 

"Oh yes, we'd have to, no question," the other one called back. 

"But why?" demanded Trillian. 

"Because there are some things you have to do even if you are an 
enlightened liberal cop who knows all about sensitivity and 
everything!" 

"I just don't believe these guys," muttered Ford, shaking his head. 

One cop shouted to the other, "Shall we shoot them again for a 
bit?" 

"Yeah, why not?" 

They let fly another electric barrage. 

The heat and noise was quite fantastic. Slowly, the computer bank 
was beginning to disintegrate. The front had almost all melted away, 
and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding their way back 
towards where they were squatting. They huddled further back and 
waited for the end. 



Chapter 33 


But the end never came, at least not then. 

Quite suddenly the barrage stopped, and the sudden silence 
afterwards was punctuated by a couple of strangled gurgles and thuds. 

The four stared at each other. 

"What happened?" said Arthur. 

"They stopped," said Zaphod with a shrug. 

"Why?" 

"Dunno, do you want to go and ask them?" 

"No." 

They waited. 

"Hello?" called out Ford. 

No answer. 

"That’s odd." 

"Perhaps it's a trap." 

"They haven't the wit." 

"What were those thuds?" 

"Dunno." 

They waited for a few more seconds. 

"Right," said Ford, "I'm going to have a look." 

He glanced round at the others. 

"Is no one going to say, No you can't possibly, let me go instead?" 
They all shook their heads. 

"Oh well," he said, and stood up. 

For a moment, nothing happened. 

Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen. Ford 
peered through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the burning 
computer. 

Cautiously he stepped out into the open. 



Still nothing happened. 

Twenty yards away he could dimly see through the smoke the 
space-suited figure of one of the cops. He was lying in a crumpled 
heap on the ground. Twenty yards in the other direction lay the 
second man. No one else was anywhere to be seen. 

This struck Ford as being extremely odd. 

Slowly, nervously, he walked towards the first one. The body lay 
reassuringly still as he approached it, and continued to lie reassuringly 
still as he reached it and put his foot down on the Kill-O-Zap gun that 
still dangled from its limp fingers. 

He reached down and picked it up, meeting no resistance. 

The cop was quite clearly dead. 

A quick examination revealed him to be from Blagulon Kappa - he 
was a methane-breathing life form, dependent on his space suit for 
survival in the thin oxygen atmosphere of Magrathea. 

The tiny life-support system computer on his backpack appeared 
unexpectedly to have blown up. 

Ford poked around in it in considerable astonishment. These 
miniature suit computers usually had the full back-up of the main 
computer back on the ship, with which they were directly linked 
through the sub-etha. Such a system was fail-safe in all circumstances 
other than total feedback malfunction, which was unheard of. 

He hurried over to the other prone figure, and discovered that 
exactly the same impossible thing had happened to him, presumably 
simultaneously. 

He called the others over to look. They came, shared his 
astonishment, but not his curiosity. 

"Let's get shot out of this hole," said Zaphod. "If whatever I'm 
supposed to be looking for is here, I don't want it." He grabbed the 
second Kill-O-Zap gun, blasted a perfectly harmless accounting 
computer and rushed out into the corridor, followed by the others. 

He very nearly blasted hell out of an aircar that stood waiting for 
them a few yards away. 

The aircar was empty, but Arthur recognized it as belonging to 
Slartibartfast. 



It had a note from him pinned to part of its sparse instrument 
panel. The note had an arrow drawn on it, pointing at one of the 
controls. 

It said, This is probably the best button to press. 



Chapter 34 


The aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R17 through the 
steel tunnels that lead out onto the appalling surface of the planet 
which was now in the grip of yet another drear morning twilight. 
Ghastly grey lights congealed on the land. 

R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel 
that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more 
than say five minutes late. It is therefore clearly an almost infinitely 
variable figure according to circumstances, since the first two factors 
vary not only with speed taken as an absolute, but also with 
awareness of the third factor. Unless handled with tranquility this 
equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers and even death. 

R17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast. 

The aircar flung itself through the air at R17 and above, deposited 
them next to the Heart of Gold which stood starkly on the frozen 
ground like a bleached bone, and then precipitately hurled itself back 
in the direction whence they had come, presumably on important 
business of its own. 

Shivering, the four of them stood and looked at the ship. 

Beside it stood another one. 

It was the Blagulon Kappa policecraft, a bulbous sharklike affair, 
slate green in colour and smothered with black stencilled letters of 
varying degrees of size and unfriendliness. The letters informed 
anyone who cared to read them as to where the ship was from, what 
section of the police it was assigned to, and where the power feeds 
should be connected. 

It seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent, even for a ship 
whose two-man crew was at that moment lying asphyxicated in a 
smoke-filled chamber several miles beneath the ground. It is one of 
those curious things that is impossible to explain or define, but one 
can sense when a ship is completely dead. 



Ford could sense it and found it most mysterious - a ship and two 
policemen seemed to have gone spontaneously dead. In his 
experience the Universe simply didn't work like that. 

The other three could sense it too, but they could sense the bitter 
cold even more and hurried back into the Heart of Gold suffering from 
an acute attack of no curiosity. 

Ford stayed, and went to examine the Blagulon ship. As he walked, 
he nearly tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down in the cold 
dust. 

"Marvin!" he exclaimed. "What are you doing?" 

"Don't feel you have to take any notice of me, please," came a 
muffled drone. 

"But how are you, metalman?" said Ford. 

"Very depressed." 

"What's up?" 

"I don't know," said Marvin, "I've never been there." 

"Why," said Ford squatting down beside him and shivering, "are 
you lying face down in the dust?" 

"It's a very effective way of being wretched," said Marvin. "Don't 
pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me." 

"No I don't." 

"Yes you do, everybody does. It's part of the shape of the Universe. 

I only have to talk to somebody and they begin to hate me. Even 
robots hate me. If you just ignore me I expect I shall probably go 
away." 

He jacked himself up to his feet and stood resolutely facing the 
opposite direction. 

"That ship hated me," he said dejectedly, indicating the policecraft. 

"That ship?" said Ford in sudden excitement. "What happened to it? 
Do you know?" 

"It hated me because I talked to it." 

"You talked to it?" exclaimed Ford. "What do you mean you talked 
to it?" 

"Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged 
myself in to its external computer feed. I talked to the computer at 
great length and explained my view of the Universe to it," said Marvin. 



"And what happened?" pressed Ford. 

"It committed suicide," said Marvin and stalked off back to the 
Heart of Gold. 



Chapter 35 


That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light years 
between itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged under the 
small palm tree on the bridge trying to bang his brain into shape with 
massive Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters; Ford and Trillian sat in a corner 
discussing life and matters arising from it; and Arthur took to his bed 
to flip through Ford's copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
Since he was going to live in the place, he reasoned, he'd better start 
finding out something about it. 

He came across this entry. 

It said: 'The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to 
pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, 
Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and 
Where phases." 

"For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How 
can we eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third 
by the question Where shall we have lunch?" 

He got no further before the ship's intercom buzzed into life. 

"Hey Earthman? You hungry kid?" said Zaphod's voice. 

"Er, well yes, a little peckish I suppose," said Arthur. 

"OK baby, hold tight," said Zaphod. "We'll take in a quick bite at the 
Restaurant at the End of the Universe."

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly 
what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear 
and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. 

There is another theory which states that this has already 
happened. 



Chapter 1 


The story so far: 

In the beginning the Universe was created. 

This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded 
as a bad move. 

Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God, 
though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the entire 
Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the 
Great Green Arkleseizure. 

The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call The 
Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures 
with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the 
only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before 
the wheel. 

However, the Great Green Arkleseizure Theory is not widely 
accepted outside Viltvodle VI and so, the Universe being the puzzling 
place it is, other explanations are constantly being sought. 

For instance, a race of hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings 
once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought 
to calculate once and for all the Answer to the Ultimate Question of 
Life, the Universe, and Everything. 

For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and 
calculated, and in the end announced that the answer was in fact 
Forty-two-and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built to 
find out what the actual question was. 

And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that it 
was frequently mistaken for a planet - especially by the strange ape¬ 
like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were 
simply part of a gigantic computer program. 

And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and obvious 
piece of knowledge, nothing that ever happened on the Earth could 
possibly make the slightest bit of sense. 



Sadly however, just before the critical moment of readout, the 
Earth was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way - so 
they claimed - for a new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of 
discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever. 

Or so it would seem. 

Two of there strange, ape-like creatures survived. 

Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend 
of his, Ford Prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small planet in 
the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he had hitherto 
claimed; and, more to the point, he knew how to hitch rides on flying 
saucers. 

Tricia McMillian - or Trillian - had skipped the planet six months 
earlier with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then President of the Galaxy. 

Two survivors. 

They are all that remains of the greatest experiment ever 
conducted - to find the Ultimate Question and the Ultimate Answer 
of Life, the Universe, and Everything. 

And, less than half a million miles from where their starship is 
drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship is 
moving slowly towards them. 



Chapter 2 


Like all Vogon ships it looked as if it had been not so much 
designed as congealed. The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices 
which protuded from it at unsightly angles would have disfigured the 
looks of most ships, but in this case that was sadly impossible. Uglier 
things have been spotted in the skies, but not by reliable witnesses. 

In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship you would 
have to go inside and look at a Vogon. If you are wise, however, this is 
precisely what you will avoid doing because the average Vogon will 
not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you 
that you will wish you had never been born - or (if you are a clearer 
minded thinker) that the Vogon had never been born. 

In fact, the average Vogon probably wouldn't even think once. They 
are simple-minded, thick-willed, slug-brained creatures, and thinking 
is not really something they are cut out for. Anatomical analysis of the 
Vogon reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed, 
misplaced and dyspeptic liver. The fairest thing you can say about 
them, then, is that they know what they like, and what they like 
generally involves hurting people and, wherever possible, getting very 
angry. 

One thing they don't like is leaving a job unfinished - particularly 
this Vogon, and particularly - for various reasons - this job. 

This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic 
Hyperspace Planning Council, and he was it who had had the job of 
demolishing the so-called "planet" Earth. 

He heaved his monumentally vile body round in his ill-fitting, slimy 
seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship Heart of 
Gold was being systematically scanned. 

It mattered little to him that the Heart of Gold, with its Infinite 
Improbability Drive, was the most beautiful and revolutionary ship 
ever built. Aesthetics and technology were closed books to him and, 
had he had his way, burnt and buried books as well. 



It mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox was aboard. 
Zaphod Beeblebrox was now the ex-President of the Galaxy, and 
though every police force in the Galaxy was currently pursuing both 
him and this ship he had stolen, the Vogon was not interested. 

He had other fish to fry. 

It has been said that Vogons are not above a little bribery and 
corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds, and 
this was certainly true in his case. When he heard the words 
"integrity" or "moral rectitude", he reached for his dictionary, and 
when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he 
reached for the rule book and threw it away. 

In seeking so implacably the destruction of the Earth and all that 
therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call of his 
professional duty. There was even some doubt as to whether the said 
bypass was actually going to be built, but the matter had been 
glossed over. 

He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction. 

"Computer," he croaked, "get me my brain care specialist on the 
line." 

Within a few seconds the face of Gag Halfrunt appeared on the 
screen, smiling the smile of a man who knew he was ten light years 
away from the Vogon face he was looking at. Mixed up somewhere in 
the smile was a glint of irony too. Though the Vogon persistently 
referred to him as "my private brain care specialist" there was not a 
lot of brain to take care of, and it was in fact Halfrunt who was 
employing the Vogon. He was paying him an awful lot of money to do 
some very dirty work. As one of the Galaxy's most prominent and 
successful psychiatrists, he and a consortium of his colleagues were 
quite prepared to spend an awful lot of money when it seemed that 
the entire future of psychiatry might be at stake. 

"Well," he said, "hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and how 
are we feeling today?" 

The Vogon captain told him that in the last few hours he had wiped 
out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise. 

Halfrunt's smile did not flicker for an instant. 



"Well," he said, "I think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a 
Vogon, you know? The natural and healthy channelling of the 
aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence." 

"That," rumbled the Vogon, "is what you always say." 

"Well again," said Halfrunt, "I think that this is perfectly normal 
behaviour for a psychiatrist. Good. We are clearly both very well 
adjusted in our mental attitudes today. Now tell me, what news of 
the mission?" 

"We have located the ship." 

"Wonderful," said Halfrunt, "wonderful! and the occupants?" 

"The Earthman is there." 

"Excellent! And...?" 

"A female from the same planet. They are the last." 

"Good, good," beamed Halfrunt, "Who else?" 

"The man Prefect." 

"Yes?" 

"And Zaphod Beeblebrox." 

For an instant Halfrunt's smile flickered. 

"Ah yes," he said, "I had been expecting this. It is most 
regrettable." 

"A personal friend?" inquired the Vogon, who had heard the 
expression somewhere once and decided to try it out. 

"Ah, no," said Halfrunt, "in my profession you know, we do not 
make personal friends." 

"Ah," grunted the Vogon, "professional detachment." 

"No," said Halfrunt cheerfully, "we just don't have the knack." 

He paused. His mouth continued to smile, but his eyes frowned 
slightly. 

"But Beeblebrox, you know," he said, "he is one of my most 
profitable clients. He had personality problems beyond the dreams of 
analysts." 

He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing it. 

"Still," he said, "you are ready for your task?" 

"Yes." 

"Good. Destroy the ship immediately." 



"What about Beeblebrox?" 

"Well," said Halfrunt brightly, "Zaphod's just this guy, you know?" 

He vanished from the screen. 

The Vogon Captain pressed a communicator button which 
connected him with the remains of his crew. 

"Attack," he said. 

At that precise moment Zaphod Beeblebrox was in his cabin 
swearing very loudly. Two hours ago, he had said that they would go 
for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, 
whereupon he had had a blazing row with the ship's computer and 
stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would work out the 
Improbability factors with a pencil. 

The Heart of Gold's Improbability Drive made it the most powerful 
and unpredictable ship in existence. There was nothing it couldn't do, 
provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you 
wanted it to do would ever happen. 

He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching 
it. He didn't know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he liked it. 

He didn't know why he had become President of the Galaxy, except 
that it seemed a fun thing to be. 

He did know that there were better reasons than these, but that 
they were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains. He 
wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go away 
because they occasionally surfaced momentarily and put strange 
thoughts into the light, fun sections of his mind and tried to deflect 
him from what he saw as being the basic business of his life, which 
was to have a wonderfully good time. 

At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time. He had 
run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry. 

"Starpox!" he shouted. 

At that same precise moment. Ford Prefect was in mid air. This was 
not because of anything wrong with the ship's artificial gravity field, 
but because he was leaping down the stair-well which led to the 
ship's personal cabins. It was a very high jump to do in one bound and 
he landed awkwardly, stumbled, recovered, raced down the corridor 



sending a couple of miniature service robots flying, skidded round the 
corner, burst into Zaphod's door and explained what was on his mind. 

"Vogons," he said. 

A short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin in 
search of a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon with a 
great deal of optimism., because he knew that the only source of hot 
drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of equipment 
produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. It was called a Nutri- 
Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered it before. 

It claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks personally 
matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared to use it. 
When put to the test, however, it invariably produced a plastic cup 
filled with a liquid that was almost, but nit quite, entirely unlike tea. 

He attempted to reason with the thing. 

"Tea," he said. 

"Share and Enjoy," the machine replied and provided him with yet 
another cup of the sickly liquid. 

He threw it away. 

"Share and enjoy," the machine repeated and provided him with 
another one. 

"Share and Enjoy" is the company motto of the hugely successful 
Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints division, which now covers 
the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is the only 
part of the Corporation to have shown a consistent profit in recent 
years. 

The motto stands - or rather stood - in three mile high illuminated 
letters near the Complaints Department spaceport on Eadrax. 
Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it was erected, 
the ground beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly 
half their length through the offices of many talented young 
complaints executives - now deceased. 

The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local 
language, to read "Go stick your head in a pig", and are no longer 
illuminated, except at times of special celebration. 

Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid. 



"Listen, you machine," he said, "you claim you can synthesize any 
drink in existence, so why do you keep giving me the same 
undrinkable stuff?" 

"Nutrition and pleasurable sense data," burbled the machine. 
"Share and Enjoy." 

"It tastes filthy!" 

"If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink," continued the 
machine, "why not share it with your friends?" 

"Because," said Arthur tartly, "I want to keep them. Will you try to 
comprehend what I'm telling you? That drink..." 

"That drink," said the machine sweetly, "was individually tailored to 
meet your personal requirements for nutrition and pleasure." 

"Ah," said Arthur, "so I'm a masochist on diet am I?" 

"Share and Enjoy." 

"Oh shut up." 

"Will that be all?" 

Arthur decided to give up. 

"Yes," he said. 

Then he decided he'd be dammed if he'd give up. 

"No," he said, "look, it's very, very simple... all I want... is a cup of 
tea. You are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and listen." 

And he sat. He told the Nutri-Matic about India, he told it about 
China, he told it about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves drying in 
the sun. He told it about silver teapots. He told it about summer 
afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting in the milk before the 
tea so it wouldn't get scalded. He even told it (briefly) about the 
history of the East India Company. 

"So that's it, is it?" said the Nutri-Matic when he had finished. 

"Yes," said Arthur, "that is what I want." 

"You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?" 

"Er, yes. With milk." 

"Squirted out of a cow?" 

"Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose..." 



"I'm going to need some help with this one," said the machine 
tersely. All the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice and it 
now meant business. 

"Well, anything I can do," said Arthur. 

"You've done quite enough," the Nutri-Matic informed him. 

It summoned up the ship's computer. 

"Hi there!" said the ship's computer. 

The Nutri-Matic explained about tea to the ship's computer. The 
computer boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutri-Matic and 
together they lapsed into a grim silence. 

Arthur watched and waited for a while, but nothing further 
happened. 

He thumped it, but still nothing happened. 

Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge. 

In the empty wastes of space, the Heart of Gold hung still. Around 
it blazed the billion pinpricks of the Galaxy. Towards it crept the ugly 
yellow lump of the Vogon ship. 



Chapter 3 


"Does anyone have a kettle?" Arthur asked as he walked on to the 
bridge, and instantly began to wonder why Trillian was yelling at the 
computer to talk to her. Ford was thumping it and Zaphod was kicking 
it, and also why there was a nasty yellow lump on the vision screen. 

He put down the empty cup he was carrying and walked over to 
them. 

"Hello?" he said. 

At that moment Zaphod flung himself over to the polished marble 
surfaces that contained the instruments that controlled the 
conventional photon drive. They materialized beneath his hands and 
he flipped over to manual control. He pushed, he pulled, he pressed 
and he swore. The photon drive gave a sickly judder and cut out again. 

"Something up?" said Arthur. 

"Hey, didja hear that?" muttered Zaphod as he leapt now for the 
manual controls of the Infinite Improbability Drive, "the monkey 
spoke!" 

The Improbability Drive gave two small whines and then also cut 
out. 

"Pure history, man," said Zaphod, kicking the Improbability Drive, 

"a talking monkey!" 

"If you're upset about something..." said Arthur. 

"Vogons!" snapped Ford, "we're under attack!" 

Arthur gibbered. 

"Well what are you doing? Let's get out of here!" 

"Can't. Computer's jammed." 

"Jammed?" 

"It says all its circuits are occupied. There's no power anywhere in 
the ship." 

Ford moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve 
across his forehead and slumped back against the wall. 



"Nothing we can do," he said. He glared at nothing and bit his lip. 

When Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the Earth had 
been demolished, he had used to play football. He had not been at all 
good at it, and his particular speciality had been scoring own goals in 
important matches. Whenever this happened he used to experience a 
peculiar tingling round the back of his neck that would slowly creep 
up across his cheeks and heat his brow. The image of mud and grass 
and lots of little jeering boys flinging it at him suddenly came vividly 
to his mind at this moment. 

A peculiar tingling sensation at the back of his neck was creeping 
up across his cheeks and heating his brow. 

He started to speak, and stopped. 

He started to speak again and stopped again. 

Finally he managed to speak. 

"Er," he said. He cleared his throat. 

"Tell me," he continued, and said it so nervously that the others all 
turned to stare at him. He glanced at the approaching yellow blob on 
the vision screen. 

"Tell me," he said again, "did the computer say what was occupying 
it? I just ask out of interest..." 

Their eyes were riveted on him. 

"And, er... well that's it really, just asking." 

Zaphod put out a hand and held Arthur by the scruff of the neck. 

"What have you done to it, Monkeyman?" he breathed. 

"Well," said Arthur, "nothing in fact. It's just that I think a short 
while ago it was trying to work out how to..." 

"Yes?" 

"Make me some tea." 

"That's right guys," the computer sang out suddenly, "just coping 
with that problem right now, and wow, it's a biggy. Be with you in a 
while." It lapsed back into a silence that was only matched for sheer 
intensity by the silence of the three people staring at Arthur Dent. 

As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons chose that moment to start 
firing. 



The ship shook, the ship thundered. Outside, the inch thick force- 
shield around it blistered, crackled and spat under the barrage of a 
dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon, and looked as if it 
wouldn't be around for long. Four minutes is how long Ford Prefect 
gave it."Three minutes and fifty seconds," he said a short while later. 

"Forty-five seconds," he added at the appropriate time. Fie flicked 
idly at some useless switches, then gave Arthur an unfriendly look. 

"Dying for a cup of tea, eh?" he said. "Three minutes and forty 
seconds." 

"Will you stop counting!" snarled Zaphod. 

"Yes," said Ford Prefect, "in three minutes and thirty-five seconds." 

Aboard the Vogon ship, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was puzzled. Fie had 
expected a chase, he had expected an exciting grapple with tractor 
beams, he had expected to have to use the specially installed Sub- 
Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron to counter the Fleart of Gold's Infinite 
Improbability Drive, but the Sub-Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron lay idle 
as the Fleart of Gold just sat there and took it. 

A dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon continued to 
blaze away at the Fleart of Gold, and still it just sat there and took it. 

Fie tested every sensor at his disposal to see if there was any subtle 
trickery afoot, but no subtle trickery was to be found. 

Fie didn't know about the tea of course. 

Nor did he know exactly how the occupants of the Fleart of Gold 
were spending the last three minutes and thirty seconds of life they 
had left to spend. 

Quite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a 
seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on. 

Obviously the subject of death was in the air, but more as 
something to be avoided than harped upon. 

Possibly the horror that Zaphod experienced at the prospect of 
being reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought that 
they might just feel the same way about him and, what's more, be 
able to do something about helping to postpone this reunion. 



Or again it might just have been one of the strange promptings that 
occasionally surfaced from that dark area of his mind that he had 
inexplicably locked off prior to becoming President of the Galaxy. 

"You want to talk to your great grandfather?" boggled Ford. 

"Yeah." 

"Does it have to be now?" 

The ship continued to shake and thunder. The temperature was 
rising. The light was getting dimmer - all the energy the computer 
didn't require for thinking about tea was being pumped into the 
rapidly fading force-field. 

"Yeah!" insisted Zaphod. "Listen Ford, I think he may be able to 
help us." 

"Are you sure you mean think? Pick your words with care." 

"Suggest something else we can do." 

"Er, well..." 

"OK, round the central console. Now. Come on! Trillian, 
Monkeyman, move." 

They clustered round the central console in confusion, sat down 
and, feeling exceptionally foolish, held hands. With his third hand 
Zaphod turned off the lights. 

Darkness gripped the ship. 

Outside, the thunderous roar of the Definit-Kil cannon continued to 
rip at the force-field. 

"Concentrate," hissed Zaphod, "on his name." 

"What is it?" asked Arthur. 

"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth." 

"What?" 

"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. Concentrate!" 

"The Fourth?" 

"Yeah. Listen, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod 
Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the 
Third..." 

"What?" 

"There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine. 
Now concentrate!" 



"Three minutes," said Ford Prefect. 

"Why," said Arthur Dent, "are we doing this?" 

"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox. 

Trillian said nothing. What, she thought, was there to say? 

The only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a 
far corner where Marvin the Paranoid Android sat slumped, ignoring 
all and ignored by all, in a private and rather unpleasant world of his 
own. 

Round the central console four figures hunched in tight 
concentration trying to blot from their minds the terrifying 
shuddering of the ship and the fearful roar that echoed through it. 

They concentrated. 

Still they concentrated. 

And still they concentrated. 

The seconds ticked by. 

On Zaphod's brow stood beads of sweat, first of concentration, 
then of frustration and finally of embarrassment. 

At last he let out a cry of anger, snatched back his hands from 
Trillian and Ford and stabbed at the light switch. 

"Ah, I was beginning to think you'd never turn the lights on," said a 
voice. "No, not too bright please, my eyes aren't what they once 
were." 

Four figures jolted upright in their seats. Slowly they turned their 
heads to look, though their scalps showed a distinct propensity to try 
and stay in the same place. 

"Now. Who disturbs me at this time?" said the small, bent, gaunt 
figure standing by the sprays of fern at the far end of the bridge. His 
two small wispy-haired heads looked so ancient that it seemed they 
might hold dim memories of the birth of the galaxies themselves. One 
lolled in sleep, but the other squinted sharply at them. If his eyes 
weren't what they once were, they must once have been diamond 
cutters. 

Zaphod stuttered nervously for a moment. Fie gave the intricate 
little double nod which is the traditional Betelgeusian gesture of 
familial respect. 

"Oh... er, hi Great Granddad..." he breathed. 



The little old figure moved closer towards them. He peered 
through the dim light. He thrust out a bony finger at his great 
grandson. 

"Ah," he snapped. "Zaphod Beeblebrox. The last of our great line. 
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth." 

"The First." 

"The Nothingth," spat the figure. Zaphod hated his voice. It always 
seemed to him to screech like fingernails across the blackboard of 
what he liked to think of as his soul. 

He shifted awkwardly in his seat. 

"Er, yeah," he muttered, "Er, look. I'm really sorry about the 
flowers, I meant to send them along, but you know, the shop was 
fresh out of wreaths and..." 

"You forget!" snapped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. 

"Well..." 

"Too busy. Never think of other people. The living are all the 
same." 

"Two minutes, Zaphod," whispered Ford in an awed whisper. 

Zaphod fidgeted nervously. 

"Yeah, but I did mean to send them," he said. "And I'll write to my 
great grandmother as well, just as soon as we get out of this..." 

"Your great grandmother," mused the gaunt little figure to himself. 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "Er, how is she? Tell you what. I'll go and see 
her. But first we've just got to..." 

"Your late great grandmother and I are very well," rasped Zaphod 
Beeblebrox the Fourth. 

"Ah. Oh." 

"But very disappointed in you, young Zaphod..." 

"Yeah well..." Zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of this 
conversation, and Ford's heavy breathing at his side told him that the 
seconds were ticking away fast. The noise and the shaking had 
reached terrifying proportions. He saw Trillian and Arthur's faces 
white and unblinking in the gloom. 

"Er, Great Grandfather..." 

"We've been following your progress with considerable 
despondency..." 



"Yeah, look, just at the moment you see..." 

"Not to say contempt!" 

"Could you sort of listen for a moment..." 

"I mean what exactly are you doing with your life?" 

"I'm being attacked by a Vogon fleet!" cried Zaphod. It was an 
exaggeration, but it was his only opportunity so far of getting the 
basic point of the exercise across. 

"Doesn't surprise me in the least," said the little old figure with a 
shrug. 

"Only it's happening right now you see," insisted Zaphod feverishly. 

The spectral ancestor nodded, picked up the cup Arthur Dent had 
brought in and looked at it with interest. 

"Er... Great Granddad..." 

"Did you know," interrupting the ghostly figure, fixing Zaphod with 
a stern look, "that Betelgeuse Five has developed a very slight 
eccentricy in its orbit?" 

Zaphod didn't and found the information hard to concentrate on 
what with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on. 

"Er, no... look," he said. 

"Me spinning in my grave!" barked the ancestor. He slammed the 
cup down and pointed a quivering, stick-like see-through finger at 
Zaphod. 

"Your fault!" he screeched. 

"One minute thirty," muttered Ford, his head in his hands. 

"Yeah, look Great Granddad, can you actually help because..." 

"Help?" exclaimed the old man as if he'd been asked for a stoat. 

"Yeah, help, and like, now, because otherwise..." 

"Help!" repeated the old man as if he'd been asked for a lightly 
grilled stoat in a bun with French fries. He stood amazed. 

"You go swanning your way round the Galaxy with your..." the 
ancestor waved a contemptuous hand, "with your disreputable 
friends, too busy to put flowers on my grave, plastic ones would have 
done, would have been quite appropriate from you, but no. Too busy. 
Too modern. Too sceptical - till you suddenly find yourself in a bit of a 
fix and come over suddenly all astrally-minded!" 



He shook his head - carefully, so as not to disturb the slumber of 
the other one, which was already becoming restive. 

"Well, I don't know, young Zaphod," he continued, "I think I'll have 
to think about this one." 

"One minute ten," said Ford hollowly. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth peered at him curiously. 

"Why does that man keep talking in numbers?" he said. 

"Those numbers," said Zaphod tersely, "are the time we've got left 
to live." 

"Oh," said his great grandfather. He grunted to himself. "Doesn't 
apply to me, of course," he said and moved off to a dimmer recess of 
the bridge in search of something else to poke around at. 

Zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and 
wondered if he shouldn't just jump over and have done with it. 

"Great Grandfather," he said, "It applies to us! We are still alive, 
and we are about to lose our lives." 

"Good job too." 

"What?" 

"What use is your life to anyone? When I think of what you've 
made of it the phrase 'pig's ear' comes irresistibly to my mind." 

"But I was President of the Galaxy, man!" 

"Huh," muttered his ancestor, "And what kind of a job is that for a 
Beeblebrox?" 

"Hey, what? Only President you know! Of the whole Galaxy!" 

"Conceited little megapuppy." 

Zaphod blinked in bewilderment. 

"Hey, er, what are you at, man? I mean Great Grandfather." 

The hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and 
tapped him sternly on the knee. This had the effect of reminding 
Zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he didn't feel a thing. 

"You know and I know what being President means, young Zaphod. 
You know because you've been it, and I know because I'm dead and it 
gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective. We have a 
saying up here. 'Life is wasted on the living.'" 

"Yeah," said Zaphod bitterly, "very good. Very deep. Right now I 
need aphorisms like I need holes in my heads." 



"Fifty seconds," grunted Ford Prefect. 

"Where was I?" said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. 

"Pontificating," said Zaphod Beeblebrox. 

"Oh yes." 

"Can this guy," muttered Ford quietly to Zaphod, "actually in fact 
help us?" 

"Nobody else can," whispered Zaphod. 

Ford nodded despondently. 

"Zaphod!" the ghost was saying, "you became President of the 
Galaxy for a reason. Flave you forgotten?" 

"Could we go into this later?" 

"Flave you forgotten!" insisted the ghost. 

"Yeah! Of course I forgot! I had to forget. They screen your brain 
when you get the job you know. If they'd found my head full of tricksy 
ideas I'd have been right out on the streets again with nothing but a 
fat pension, secretarial staff, a fleet of ships and a couple of slit 
throats." 

"Ah," nodded the ghost in satisfaction, "then you do remember!" 

Fie paused for a moment. 

"Good," he said and the noise stopped. 

"Forty-eight seconds," said Ford. Fie looked again at his watch and 
tapped it. Fie looked up. 

"Fley, the noise has stopped," he said. 

A mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghost's hard little eyes. 

"I've slowed down time for a moment," he said, "just for a moment 
you understand. I would hate you to miss all I have to say." 

"No, you listen to me, you see-through old bat," said Zaphod 
leaping out of his chair, "A - thanks for stopping time and all that, 
great, terrific, wonderful, but B - no thanks for the homily, right? I 
don't know what this great think I'm meant to be doing is, and it looks 
to me as if I was supposed not to know. And I resent that, right? 

"The old me knew. The old me cared. Fine, so far so hoopy. Except 
that the old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own 
brain - my own brain - and locked off the bits that knew and cared, 
because if I knew and cared I wouldn't be able to do it. I wouldn't be 



able to go and be President, and I wouldn't be able to steal this ship, 
which must be the important thing. 

"But this former self of mine killed himself off, didn't he, by 
changing my brain? OK, that was his choice. This new me has its own 
choices to make, and by a strange coincidence those choices involve 
not knowing and not caring about this big number, whatever it is. 
That's what he wanted, that's what he got. 

"Except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in control, 
leaving orders for me in the bit of my brain he locked off. Well, I don't 
want to know, and I don't want to hear them. That's my choice. I'm 
not going to be anybody's puppet, particularly not my own." 

Zaphod banged the console in fury, oblivious to the dumbfolded 
looks he was attracting. 

"The old me is dead!" he raved, "Killed himself! The dead shouldn't 
hang about trying to interfere with the living!" 

"And yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape," said the 
ghost. 

"Ah," said Zaphod, sitting down again, "well that's different isn't 
it?" 

He grinned at Trillian, weakly. 

"Zaphod," rasped the apparition, "I think the only reason I waste 
my breath on you is that being dead I don't have any other use for it." 

"OK," said Zaphod, "why don't you tell me what the big secret is. 
Try me." 

"Zaphod, you knew when you were President of the Galaxy, as did 
Yooden Vranx before you, that the President is nothing. A cipher. 
Somewhere in the shadows behind is another man, being, something, 
with ultimate power. That man, or being, or something, you must find 
- the man who controls this Galaxy, and - we suspect - others. 
Possibly the entire Universe." 

"Why?" 

"Why?" exclaimed an astonished ghost, "Why? Look around you 
lad, does it look to you as if it's in very good hands?" 

"It's alright." 

The old ghost glowered at him. 



"I will not argue with you. You will simply take this ship, this 
Improbability Drive ship to where it is needed. You will do it. Don't 
think you can escape your purpose. The Improbability Field controls 
you, you are in its grip. What's this?" 

He was standing tapping at one of the terminals of Eddie the 
Shipboard Computer. Zaphod told him. 

"What's it doing?" 

"It is trying," said Zaphod with wonderful restraint, "to make tea." 

"Good," said his great grandfather, "I approve of that. Now Zaphod, 
"he said, turning and wagging a finger at him, "I don't know if you are 
really capable of succeeding in your job. I think you will not be able to 
avoid it. However, I am too long dead and too tired to care as much as 
I did. The principal reason I am helping you now is that I couldn't bear 
the thought of you and your modern friends slouching about up here. 
Understood?" 

"Yeah, thanks a bundle." 

"Oh, and Zaphod?" 

"Er, yeah?" 

"If you ever find you need help again, you know, if you're in trouble, 
need a hand out of a tight corner..." 

"Yeah?" 

"Please don't hesitate to get lost." 

Within the space of one second, a bolt of light flashed from the 
wizened old ghost's hands to the computer, the ghost vanished, the 
bridge filled with billowing smoke and the Heart of Gold leapt an 
unknown distance through the dimensions of time and space. 



Chapter 4 


Ten light years away, Gag Halfrunt jacked up his smile by several 
notches. As he watched the picture on his vision screen, relayed 
across the sub-ether from the bridge of the Vogon ship, he saw the 
final shreds of the Heart of Gold's force-shield ripped away, and the 
ship itself vanish in a puff of smoke. 

Good, he thought. 

The end of the last stray survivors of the demolition he had 
ordered on the planet Earth, he thought. 

The final end of this dangerous (to the psychiatric profession) and 
subversive (also to the psychiatric profession) experiment to find the 
Question to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and 
Everything, he thought. 

There would be some celebration with his fellows tonight, and in 
the morning they would meet again their unhappy, bewildered and 
highly profitable patients, secure in the knowledge that the Meaning 
of Life would not now be, once and for all, well and truly sorted out, 
he thought. 

"Family's always embarrassing isn't it?" said Ford to Zaphod as the 
smoke began to clear. 

He paused, then looked about. 

"Where's Zaphod?" he said. 

Arthur and Trillian looked about blankly. They were pale and 
shaken and didn't know where Zaphod was. 

"Marvin?" said Ford, "Where's Zaphod?" 

A moment later he said: 

"Where's Marvin?" 

The robot's corner was empty. 



The ship was utterly silent. It lay in thick black space. Occasionally it 
rocked and swayed. Every instrument was dead, every vision screen 
was dead. They consulted the computer. It said: 

"I regret that I have been temporarily closed to all communication. 
Meanwhile, here is some light music." 

They turned off the light music. 

They searched every corner of the ship in increasing bewilderment 
and alarm. Everywhere was dead and silent. Nowhere was there any 
trace of Zaphod or of Marvin. 

One of the last areas they checked was the small bay in which the 
Nutri-Matic machine was located. 

On the delivery plate of the Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer was a 
small tray, on which sat three bone china cups and saucers, a bone 
china jug of milk, a silver teapot full of the best tea Arthur had ever 
tasted, and a small printed note saying "Wait". 



Chapter 5 


Ursa Minor Beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in 
the known Universe. 

Although it is excruciatingly rich, horrifyingly sunny and more full of 
wonderfully exciting people than a pomegranate is of pips, it can 
hardly be insignificant that when a recent edition of Playbeing 
magazine headlined an article with the words "When you are tired of 
Ursa Minor Beta you are tired of life", the suicide rate quadrupled 
overnight. 

Not that there are any nights on Ursa Minor Beta. 

It is a West Zone planet which by an inexplicable and somewhat 
suspicious freak of topography consists almost entirely of sub-tropical 
coastline. By an equally suspicious freak of temporal relastatics, it is 
nearly always Saturday afternoon just before the beach bars close. 

No adequate explanation for this has been forthcoming from the 
dominant lifeforms on Ursa Minor Beta, who spend most of their time 
attempting to achieve spiritual enlightenment by running round 
swimming pools, and inviting Investigation Officials form the Galactic 
Geo-Temporal Control Board to "have a nice diurnal anomaly". 

There is only one city on Ursa Minor Beta, and that is only called a 
city because the swimming pools are slightly thicker on the ground 
there than elsewhere. 

If you approach Light City by air - and there is no other way of 
approaching it, no roads, no port facilities - if you don't fly they don't 
want to see you in Light City - you will see why it has this name. Here 
the sun shines brightest of all, glittering on the swimming pools, 
shimmering on the white, palm-lined boulevards, glistening on the 
healthy bronzed specks moving up and down them, gleaming off the 
villas, the hazy airpads, the beach bars and so on. 

Most particularly it shines on a building, a tall beautiful building 
consisting of two thirty-storey white towers connected by a bridge 
half-way up their length. 



The building is the home of a book, and was built here on the 
proceeds of an extraordinary copyright law suit fought between the 
book's editors and a breakfast cereal company. 

The book is a guide book, a travel book. 

It is one of the most remarkable, certainly the most successful, 
books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa 
Minor - more popular than Life Begins at Five Hundred and Fifty, 
better selling than The Big Bang Theory - A Personal View by 
Eccentrica Gallumbits (the triple breasted whore of Eroticon Six) and 
more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's latest blockbusting title 
Everything You Never Wanted To Know About Sex But Have Been 
Forced To Find Out. 

(And in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern 
Rim of the Galaxy, it has long surplanted the great Encyclopaedia 
Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for 
though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, 
or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older and more 
pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper, 
and secondly it has the words DON'T PANIC printed in large friendly 
letters on its cover.) 

It is of course that invaluable companion for all those who want to 
see the marvels of the known Universe for less than thirty Altairan 
Dollars a day - The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 

If you stood with your back to the main entrance lobby of the 
Guide offices (assuming you had landed by now and freshened up 
with a quick dip and shower) and then walked east, you would pass 
along the leafy shade of Life Boulevard, be amazed by the pale golden 
colour of the beaches stretching away to your left, astounded by the 
mind-surfers floating carelessly along two feet above the waves as if it 
was nothing special, surprised and eventually slightly irritated by the 
giant palm trees that hum toneless nothings throughout the daylight 
hours, in other words continuously. 

If you then walked to the end of Life Boulevard you would enter 
the Lalamatine district of shops, bolonut trees and pavement cafes 
where the UM-Betans come to relax after a hard afternoon's 
relaxation on the beach. The Lalamatine district is one of those very 
few areas which doesn't enjoy a perpetual Saturday afternoon - it 



enjoys instead the cool of a perpetual early Saturday evening. Behind 
it lie the night clubs. 

If, on this particular day, afternoon, stretch of eveningtime - call it 
what you will - you had approached the second pavement cafe on the 
right you would have seen the usual crowd of UM-Betans chatting, 
drinking, looking very relaxed, and casually glancing at each other's 
watches to see how expensive they were. 

You would also have seen a couple of rather dishevelled looking 
hitch-hikers from Algol who had recently arrived on an Arcturan 
Megafreighter aboard which they had been roughing it for a few days. 
They were angry and bewildered to discover that here, within sight of 
the Hitchhiker's Guide building itself, a simple glass of fruit juice cost 
the equivalent of over sixty Altairan dollars. 

"Sell out," one of them said, bitterly. 

If at that moment you had then looked at the next table but one 
you would have seen Zaphod Beeblebrox sitting and looking very 
startled and confused. 

The reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had 
been sitting on the bridge of the starship Heart of Gold. 

"Absolute sell out," said the voice again. 

Zaphod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two 
dishevelled hitch-hikers at the next table. Where the hell was he? 

How had he got there? Where was his ship? His hand felt the arm of 
the chair on which he was sitting, and then the table in front of him. 
They seemed solid enough. He sat very still. 

"How can they sit and write a guide for hitch-hikers in a place like 
this?" continued the voice. "I mean look at it. Look at it!" 

Zaphod was looking at it. Nice place, he thought. But where? And 
why? 

He fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses. In the same 
pocket he felt a hard smooth, unidentified lump of very heavy metal. 
He pulled it out and looked at it. He blinked at it in surprise. Where 
had he got that? He returned it to his pocket and put on the 
sunglasses, annoyed to discover that the metal object had scratched 
one of the lenses. Nevertheless, he felt much more comfortable with 
them on. They were a double pair of Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic 
Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, which had been specially designed to help 



people develop a relaxed attitude to danger. At the first hint of 
trouble they turn totally black and thus prevent you from seeing 
anything that might alarm you. 

Apart from the scratch the lenses were clear. He relaxed, but only a 
little bit. 

The angry hitch-hiker continued to glare at his monstrously 
expensive fruit juice. 

"Worst thing that ever happened to the Guide, moving to Ursa 
Minor Beta," he grumbled, "they've all gone soft. You know, I've even 
heard that they've created a whole electronically synthesized 
Universe in one of their offices so they can go and research stories 
during the day and still go to parties in the evening. Not that day and 
evening mean much in this place." 

Ursa Minor Beta, thought Zaphod. At least he knew where he was 
now. He assumed that this must be his great grandfather's doing, but 
why? 

Much to his annoyance, a thought popped into his mind. It was 
very clear and very distinct, and he had now come to recognize these 
thoughts for what they were. His instinct was to resist them. They 
were the pre-ordained promptings from the dark and locked off parts 
of his mind. 

He sat still and ignored the thought furiously. It nagged at him. He 
ignored it. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He gave in 
to it. 

What the hell, he thought, go with the flow. He was too tired, 
confused and hungry to resist. He didn't even know what the thought 
meant. 



Chapter 6 


"Hello? Yes? Megadodo Publications, home of the Hitchhiker's 
Guide to the Galaxy, the most totally remarkable book in the whole of 
the known Universe, can I help you?" said the large pink-winged 
insect into one of the seventy phones lined up along the vast chrome 
expanse of the reception desk in the foyer of the Hitchhiker's Guide to 
the Galaxy offices. It fluttered its wings and rolled its eyes. It glared at 
all the grubby people cluttering up the foyer, soiling the carpets and 
leaving dirty handmarks on the upholstery. It adored working for the 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it just wished there was some way of 
keeping all the hitch-hikers away. Weren't they meant to be hanging 
round dirty spaceports or something? It was certain that it had read 
something somewhere in the book about the importance of hanging 
round dirty spaceports. Unfortunately most of them seemed to come 
and hang around in this nice clean shiny foyer after hanging around in 
extremely dirty spaceports. And all they ever did was complain. It 
shivered its wings. 

"What?" it said into the phone. "Yes, I passed on your message to 
Mr. Zarniwoop, but I'm afraid he's too cool to see you right now. He's 
on an intergalactic cruise." 

It waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people who was 
angrily trying to engage its attention. The petulant tentacle directed 
the angry person to look at the notice on the wall to its left and not to 
interrupt an important phone call. 

"Yes," said the insect, "he is in his office, but he's on an 
intergalactic cruise. Thank you so much for calling." It slammed down 
the phone. 

"Read the notice," it said to the angry man who was trying to 
complain about one of the more ludicrous and dangerous pieces of 
misinformation contained in the book. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an indispensable companion 
to all those who are keen to make sense of life in an infinitely complex 



and confusing Universe, for though it cannot hope to be useful or 
informative on all matters, it does at least make the reassuring claim, 
that where it is inaccurate it is at least definitely inaccurate. In cases 
of major discrepancy it's always reality that's got it wrong. 

This was the gist of the notice. It said "The Guide is definitive. 
Reality is frequently inaccurate." 

This has led to some interesting consequences. For instance, when 
the Editors of the Guide were sued by the families of those who had 
died as a result of taking the entry on the planet Traal literally (it said 
"Ravenous Bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal for visiting 
tourists" instead of "Ravenous Bugblatter beasts often make a very 
good meal of visiting tourists") they claimed that the first version of 
the sentence was the more aesthetically pleasing, summoned a 
qualified poet to testify under oath that beauty was truth, truth 
beauty and hoped thereby to prove that the guilty party was Life itself 
for failing to be either beautiful or true. The judges concurred, and in 
a moving speech held that Life itself was in contempt of court, and 
duly confiscated it from all those there present before going off to 
enjoy a pleasant evening's ultragolf. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox entered the foyer. He strode up to the insect 
receptionist. 

"OK," he said, "Where's Zarniwoop? Get me Zarniwoop." 

"Excuse me, sir?" said the insect icily. It did not care to be 
addressed in this manner. 

"Zarniwoop. Get him, right? Get him now." 

"Well, sir," snapped the fragile little creature, "if you could be a 
little cool about it..." 

Look," said Zaphod, "I'm up to here with cool, OK? I'm so amazingly 
cool you could keep a side of meat inside me for a month. I am so hip 
I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis. Now will you move before you 
blow it?" 

"Well, if you'd let me explain, sir," said the insect tapping the most 
petulant of all the tentacles at its disposal, "I'm afraid that isn't 
possible right now as Mr. Zarniwoop is on an intergalactic cruise." 

Hell, thought Zaphod. 

"When he's going to be back?" he said. 

"Back sir? He's in his office." 



Zaphod paused while he tried to sort this particular thought out in 
his mind. He didn't succeed. 

"This cat's on an intergalactic cruise... in his office?" He leaned 
forward and gripped the tapping tentacle. 

"Listen, three eyes," he said, "don't you try to outweird me. I get 
stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal." 

"Well, just who do you think you are, honey?" flounced the insect 
quivering its wings in rage, "Zaphod Beeblebrox or something?" 

"Count the heads," said Zaphod in a low rasp. 

The insect blinked at him. It blinked at him again. 

"You are Zaphod Beeblebrox?" it squeaked. 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "but don't shout it out or they'll all want one." 

"The Zaphod Beeblebrox?" 

"No, just a Zaphod Beeblebrox, didn't you hear I come in six 
packs?" 

The insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation. 

"But sir," it squealed, "I just heard on the sub-ether radio report. It 
said that you were dead..." 

"Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod, "I just haven't stopped moving yet. 
Now. Where do I find Zarniwoop?" 

"Well, sir, his office is on the fifteenth floor, but..." 

"But he's on an intergalactic cruise, yeah, yeah, how do I get to 
him." 

"The newly installed Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Vertical People 
Transporters are in the far corner sir. But sir..." 

Zaphod was turning to go. He turned back. 

"Yeah?" he said. 

"Can I ask you why you want to see Mr. Zarniwoop?" 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, who was unclear on this point himself, "I told 
myself I had to." 

"Come again sir?" 

Zaphod leaned forward, conspirationally. 

"I just materialized out of thin air in one of your cafes," he said, "as 
a result of an argument with the ghost of my great grandfather. No 
sooner had I got there that my former self, the one that operated on 



my brain, popped into my head and said 'Go see Zarniwoop'. I have 
never heard of the cat. That is all I know. That and the fact that I've 
got to find the man who rules the Universe." 

He winked. 

"Mr. Beeblebrox, sir," said the insect in awed wonder, "you're so 
weird you should be in movies." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink wing, 

"and you, baby, should be in real life." 

The insect paused for a moment to recover from its agitation and 
then reached out a tentacle to answer a ringing phone. 

A metal hand restrained it. 

"Excuse me," said the owner of the metal hand in a voice that 
would have made an insect of a more sentimental disposition collapse 
in tears. 

This was not such an insect, and it couldn't stand robots. 

"Yes, sir," it snapped, "can I help you?" 

"I doubt it," said Marvin. 

"Well in that case, if you'll just excuse me..." Six of the phones were 
now ringing. A million things awaited the insect's attention. 

"No one can help me," intoned Marvin. 

"Yes, sir, well..." 

"Not that anyone tried of course." The restraining metal hand fell 
limply by Marvin's side. His head hung forward very slightly. 

"Is that so," said the insect tartly. 

"Hardly worth anyone's while to help a menial robot is it?" 

"I'm sorry, sir, if..." 

"I mean where's the percentage in being kind or helpful to a robot 
if it doesn't have any gratitude circuits?" 

"And you don't have any?" said the insect, who didn't seem to be 
able to drag itself out of this conversation. 

"I've never had occasion to find out," Marvin informed it. 

"Listen, you miserable heap of maladjusted metal..." 

"Aren't you going to ask me what I want?" 

The insect paused. Its long thin tongue darted out and licked its 
eyes and darted back again. 



"Is it worth it?" it asked. 

"Is anything?" said Marvin immediately. 

"What... do... you... want?" 

"I'm looking for someone." 

"Who?" hissed the insect. 

"Zaphod Beeblebrox," said Marvin, "he's over there." 

The insect shook with rage. It could hardly speak. 

"Then why did you ask me?" it screamed. 

"I just wanted something to talk to," said Marvin. 

"What!" 

"Pathetic isn't it?" 

With a grinding of gears Marvin turned and trundled off. He caught 
up with Zaphod approaching the elevators. Zaphod span round in 
astonishment. 

"Hey... Marvin!" he said, "Marvin! How did you get here?" 

Marvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him. 

"I don't know," he said. 

"But..." 

"One moment I was sitting in your ship feeling very depressed, and 
the next moment I was standing here feeling utterly miserable. An 
Improbability Field I expect." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "I expect my great grandfather sent you along 
to keep me company." 

"Thanks a bundle grandad," he added to himself under his breath. 

"So, how are you?" he said aloud. 

"Oh, fine," said Marvin, "if you happen to like being me which 
personally I don't." 

"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod as the elevator doors opened. 

"Hello," said the elevator sweetly, "I am to be your elevator for this 
trip to the floor of your choice. I have been designed by the Sirius 
Cybernetics Corporation to take you, the visitor to the Hitchhiker's 
Guide to the Galaxy, into these their offices. If you enjoy your ride, 
which will be swift and pleasurable, then you may care to experience 
some of the other elevators which have recently been installed in the 
offices of the Galactic tax department, Boobiloo Baby Foods and the 



Sirian State Mental Hospital, where many ex-Sirius Cybernetics 
Corporation executives will be delighted to welcome your visits, 
sympathy, and happy tales of the outside world." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, stepping into it, "what else do you do besides 
talk?" 

"I go up," said the elevator, "or down." 

"Good," said Zaphod, "We're going up." 

"Or down," the elevator reminded him. 

"Yeah, OK, up please." 

There was a moment of silence. 

"Down's very nice," suggested the elevator hopefully. 

"Oh yeah?" 

"Super." 

"Good," said Zaphod, "Now will you take us up?" 

"May I ask you," inquired the elevator in its sweetest, most 
reasonable voice, "if you've considered all the possibilities that down 
might offer you?" 

Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall. He didn't 
need this, he thought to himself, this of all things he had no need of. 
He hadn't asked to be here. If he was asked at this moment where he 
would like to be he would probably have said he would like to be lying 
on the beach with at least fifty beautiful women and a small team of 
experts working out new ways they could be nice to him, which was 
his usual reply. To this he would probably have added something 
passionate on the subject of food. 

One thing he didn't want to be doing was chasing after the man 
who ruled the Universe, who was only doing a job which he might as 
well keep at, because if it wasn't him it would only be someone else. 
Most of all he didn't want to be standing in an office block arguing 
with an elevator. 

"Like what other possibilities?" he asked wearily. 

"Well," the voice trickled on like honey on biscuits, "there's the 
basement, the microfiles, the heating system... er..." 

It paused. 

"Nothing particularly exciting," it admitted, "but they are 
alternatives." 



"Holy Zarquon," muttered Zaphod, "did I ask for an existentialist 
elevator?" he beat his fists against the wall. 

"What's the matter with the thing?" he spat. 

"It doesn't want to go up," said Marvin simply, "I think it's afraid." 

"Afraid?" cried Zaphod, "Of what? Heights? An elevator that's 
afraid of heights?" 

"No," said the elevator miserably, "of the future..." 

"The future?" exclaimed Zaphod, "What does the wretched thing 
want, a pension scheme?" 

At that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall 
behind them. From the walls around them came the sound of 
suddenly active machinery. 

"We can all see into the future," whispered the elevator in what 
sounded like terror, "it's part of our programming." 

Zaphod looked out of the elevator - an agitated crowd had 
gathered round the elevator area, pointing and shouting. 

Every elevator in the building was coming down, very fast. 

He ducked back in. 

"Marvin," he said, "just get this elevator go up will you? We've got 
to get to Zarniwoop." 

"Why?" asked Marvin dolefully. 

"I don't know," said Zaphod, "but when I find him, he'd better have 
a very good reason for me wanting to see him." 

Modern elevators are strange and complex entities. The ancient 
electric winch and "maximum-capacity-eight-persons" jobs bear as 
much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical 
People Transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west 
wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital. 

This is because they operate on the curios principle of "defocused 
temporal perception". In other words they have the capacity to see 
dimly into the immediate future, which enables the elevator to be on 
the right floor to pick you up even before you knew you wanted it, 
thus eliminating all the tedious chatting, relaxing, and making friends 
that people were previously forced to do whist waiting for elevators. 



Not unnaturally, many elevators imbued with intelligence and 
precognition became terribly frustrated with the mindless business of 
going up and down, up and down, experimented briefly with the 
notion of going sideways, as a sort of existential protest, demanded 
participation in the decision-making process and finally took to 
squatting in basements sulking. 

An impoverished hitch-hiker visiting any planets in the Sirius star 
system these days can pick up easy money working as a counsellor for 
neurotic elevators. 

At the fifteenth floor the elevator doors opened quickly. 

"Fifteenth," said the elevator, "and remember. I'm only doing this 
because I like your robot." 

Zaphod and Marvin bundled out of the elevator which instantly 
snapped its doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would 
take it. 

Zaphod looked around warily. The corridor was deserted and silent 
and gave no clue as to where Zarniwoop might be found. All the doors 
that led off the corridor were closed and unmarked. 

They were standing close to the bridge which led across from one 
tower of the building to the other. Through a large window the 
brilliant sun of Ursa Minor Beta threw blocks of light in which danced 
small specks of dust. A shadow flitted past momentarily. 

"Left in the lurch by a lift," muttered Zaphod, who was feeling at 
his least jaunty. 

They both stood and looked in both directions. 

"You know something?" said Zaphod to Marvin. 

"More that you can possibly imagine." 

"I'm dead certain this building shouldn't be shaking," Zaphod said. 

It was just a light tremor through the soles of his feet - and 
another one. In the sunbeams the flecks of dust danced more 
vigorously. Another shadow flitted past. 

Zaphod looked at the floor. 

"Either," he said, not very confidently, "they've got some vibro 
system for toning up your muscles while you work, or..." 



He walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled because 
at that moment his Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive 
sunglasses had turned utterly black. A large shadow flitted past the 
window with a sharp buzz. 

Zaphod ripped off his sunglasses, and as he did so the building 
shook with a thunderous roar. He leapt to the window. 

"Or," he said, "this building's being bombed!" 

Another roar cracked through the building. 

"Who in the Galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company?" 
asked Zaphod, but never heard Marvin's reply because at that 
moment the building shook with another bomb attack. He tried to 
stagger back to the elevator - a pointless manoeuvre he realized, but 
the only one he could think of. 

Suddenly, at the end of the corridor leading at right angles from 
this one, he caught sight of a figure as it lunged into view, a man. The 
man saw him. 

"Beeblebrox, over here!" he shouted. 

Zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb blast rocked the 
building. 

"No," called Zaphod, "Beeblebrox over here! Who are you?" 

"A friend!" shouted back the man. He ran towards Zaphod. 

"Oh yeah?" said Zaphod, "Anyone's friend in particular, or just 
generally well disposed of people?" 

The man raced along the corridor, the floor bucking beneath his 
feet like an excited blanket. He was short, stocky and weatherbeaten 
and his clothes looked as if they'd been twice round the Galaxy and 
back with him in them. 

"Do you know," Zaphod shouted in his ear when he arrived, "your 
building's being bombed?" 

The man indicated his awareness. 

It suddenly stopped being light. Glancing round at the window to 
see why, Zaphod gaped as a huge sluglike, gunmetal-green spacecraft 
crept through the air past the building. Two more followed it. 

"The government you deserted is out to get you, Zaphod," hissed 
the man, "they've sent a squadron of Frogstar Fighters." 

"Frogstar Fighters!" muttered Zaphod, "Zarquon!" 



"You get the picture?" 

"What are Frogstar Fighters?" Zaphod was sure he'd heard 
someone talk about them when he was President, but he never paid 
much attention to official matters. 

The man was pulling him back through a door. Fie went with him. 
With a searing whine a small black spider-like object shot through the 
air and disappeared down the corridor. 

"What was that?" hissed Zaphod. 

"Frogstar Scout robot class A out looking for you," said the man. 

"Hey yeah?" 

"Get down!" 

From the opposite direction came a larger black spider-like object. 
It zapped past them. 

"And that was...?" 

"A Frogstar Scout robot class B out looking for you." 

"And that?" said Zaphod, as a third one seared through the air. 

"A Frogstar Scout robot class C out looking for you." 

"Hey," chuckled Zaphod to himself, "pretty stupid robots eh?" 

From over the bridge came a massive rumbling hum. A gigantic 
black shape was moving over it from the opposite tower, the size and 
shape of a tank. 

"Holy photon, what's that?" 

"A tank," said the man, "Frogstar Scout robot class D come to get 
you." 

"Should we leave?" 

"I think we should." 

"Marvin!" called Zaphod. 

"What do you want?" 

Marvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the corridor and 
looked at them. 

"You see that robot coming towards us?" 

Marvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward towards 
them over the bridge. He looked down at his own small metal body. 
He looked back up at the tank. 

"I suppose you want me to stop it," he said. 



"Yeah." 

"Whilst you save your skins." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "get in there!" 

"Just so long," said Marvin, "as I know where I stand." 

The man tugged at Zaphod's arm, and Zaphod followed him off 
down the corridor. 

A point occurred to him about this. 

"Where are we going?" he said. 

"Zarniwoop's office." 

"Is this any time to keep an appointment?" 

"Come on." 



Chapter 7 


Marvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor. He was not in fact a 
particularly small robot. His silver body gleamed in the dusty 
sunbeams and shook with the continual barrage which the building 
was still undergoing. 

He did, however, look pitifully small as the gigantic black tank 
rolled to a halt in front of him. The tank examined him with a probe. 
The probe withdrew. 

Marvin stood there. 

"Out of my way little robot," growled the tank. 

"I'm afraid," said Marvin, "that I've been left here to stop you." 

The probe extended again for a quick recheck. It withdrew again. 

"You? Stop me?" roared the tank. "Go on!" 

"No, really I have," said Marvin simply. 

"What are you armed with?" roared the tank in disbelief. 

"Guess," said Marvin. 

The tank's engines rumbled, its gears ground. Molecule-sized 
electronic relays deep in its micro-brain flipped backwards and 
forwards in consternation. 

"Guess?" said the tank. 

Zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, 
down a second and along a third. The building continued to rock and 
judder and this puzzled Zaphod. If they wanted to blow the building 
up, why was it taking so long? 

With difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous 
unmarked doors and heaved at it. With a sudden jolt it opened and 
they fell inside. 

All this way, thought Zaphod, all this trouble, all this not-lying-on- 
the-beach-having-a-wonderful-time, and for what? A single chair, a 
single desk and a single dirty ashtray in an undecorated office. The 



desk, apart from a bit of dancing dust and single, revolutionary form 
of paper clip, was empty. 

"Where," said Zaphod, "is Zarniwoop?" feeling that his already 
tenuous grasp of the point of this whole exercise was beginning to slip. 

"He's on an intergalactic cruise," said the man. 

Zaphod tried to size the man up. Earnest type, he thought, not a 
barrel of laughs. He probably apportioned a fair whack of his time to 
running up and down heaving corridors, breaking down doors and 
making cryptic remarks in empty offices. 

"Let me introduce myself," the man said, "My name is Roosta, and 
this is my towel." 

"Hello Roosta," said Zaphod. 

"Hello, towel," he added as Roosta held out to him a rather nasty 
old flowery towel. Not knowing what to do with it, he shook it by the 
corner. 

Outside the window, one of the huge slug-like, gunmetal-green 
spaceships growled past. 

"Yes, go on," said Marvin to the huge battle machine, "you'll never 
guess." 

"Errmmm..." said the machine, vibrating with unaccustomed 
thought, "laser beams?" 

Marvin shook his head solemnly. 

"No," muttered the machine in its deep guttural rumble, "Too 
obvious. Anti-matter ray?" it hazarded. 

"Far too obvious," admonished Marvin. 

"Yes," grumbled the machine, somewhat abashed, "Er... how about 
an electron ram?" 

This was new to Marvin. 

"What's that?" he said. 

"One of these," said the machine with enthusiasm. 

From its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single lethal 
blaze of light. Behind Marvin a wall roared and collapsed as a heap of 
dust. The dust billowed briefly, then settled. 

"No," said Marvin, "not one of those." 

"Good though, isn't it?" 



"Very good," agreed Marvin. 

"I know," said the Frogstar battle machine, after another moment's 
consideration, "you must have one of those new Xanthic Re-Structron 
Destabilized Zenon Emitters!" 

"Nice, aren't they?" said Marvin. 

"That's what you've got?" said the machine in considerable awe. 

"No," said Marvin. 

"Oh," said the machine, disappointed, "then it must be..." 

"You're thinking along the wrong lines," said Marvin, "You're failing 
to take into account something fairly basic in the relationship 
between men and robots." 

"Er, I know," said the battle machine, "is it..." it tailed off into 
thought again. 

"Just think," urged Marvin, "they left me, an ordinary, menial robot, 
to stop you, a gigantic heavy-duty battle machine, whilst they ran off 
to save themselves. What do you think they would leave me with?" 

"Oooh, er," muttered the machine in alarm, "something pretty 
damn devastating I should expect." 

"Expect!" said Marvin, "oh yes, expect. I'll tell you what they gave 
me to protect myself with shall I." 

"Yes, alright," said the battle machine, bracing itself. 

"Nothing," said Marvin. 

There was a dangerous pause. 

"Nothing?" roared the battle machine. 

"Nothing at all," intoned Marvin dismally, "not an electronic 
sausage." 

The machine heaved about with fury. 

"Well, doesn't that just take the biscuit!" it roared, "Nothing, eh? 
Just don't think, do they?" 

"And me," said Marvin in a soft low voice, "with this terrible pain in 
all the diodes down my left side." 

"Makes you spit, doesn't it?" 

"Yes," agreed Marvin with feeling. 

"Hell that makes me angry," bellowed the machine, "think I'll 
smash that wall down!" 



The electron ram stabbed out another searing blaze of light and 
took out the wall next to the machine. 

"How do you think I feel?" said Marvin bitterly. 

"Just ran off and left you, did they?" the machine thundered. 

"Yes," said Marvin. 

"I think I'll shoot down their bloody ceiling as well!" raged the tank. 

It took out the ceiling of the bridge. 

"That's very impressive," murmured Marvin. 

"You ain't seeing nothing yet," promised the machine, "I can take 
out this floor too, no trouble!" 

It took out the floor, too. 

"Hell's bells!" the machine roared as it plummeted fifteen storeys 
and smashed itself to bits on the ground below. 

"What a depressingly stupid machine," said Marvin and trudged 
away. 



Chapter 8 


"So, do we just sit here, or what?" said Zaphod angrily, "what do 
these guys out here want?" 

"You, Beeblebrox," said Roosta, "they're going to take you to the 
Frogstar - the most totally evil world in the Galaxy." 

"Oh, yeah?" said Zaphod. "They'll have to come and get me first." 

"They have come and got you," said Roosta, "look out of the 
window." 

Zaphod looked, and gaped. 

"The ground's going away!" he gasped, "where are they taking the 
ground?" 

"They're taking the building," said Roosta, "we're airborne." 

Clouds streaked past the office window. 

Out in the open air again Zaphod could see the ring of dark green 
Frogstar Fighters round the uprooted tower of the building. A 
network of force beams radiated in from them and held the tower in 
a firm grip. 

Zaphod shook his head in perplexity. 

"What have I done to deserve this?" he said, "I walk into a building, 
they take it away." 

"It's not what you've done they're worried about," said Roosta, "it's 
what you're going to do." 

"Well don't I get a say in that?" 

"You did, years ago. You'd better hold on, we're in for a fast and 
bumpy journey." 

"If I ever meet myself," said Zaphod, "I'll hit myself so hard I won't 
know what's hit me." 

Marvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zaphod accusingly, 
slumped in a corner and switched himself off. 



On the bridge of the Heart of Gold, all was silent. Arthur stared at 
the rack in front of him and thought. He caught Trillian's eyes as she 
looked at him inquiringly. He looked back at the rack. 

Finally he saw it. 

He picked up five small plastic squares and laid them on the board 
that lay just in front of the rack. 

The five squares had on them the five letters E, X, Q, U and I. He 
laid them next to the letters S, I, T, E. 

"Exquisite," he said, "on a triple word score. Scores rather a lot I'm 
afraid." 

The ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for the 'n'th 
time. 

Trillian sighed and started to sort them out again. 

Up and down the silent corridors echoed Ford Prefect's feet as he 
stalked the ship thumping dead instruments. 

Why did the ship keep shaking? he thought. 

Why did it rock and sway? 

Why could he not find out where they were? 

Where, basically, were they? 

The left-hand tower of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices 
streaked through interstellar space at a speed never equalled either 
before or since by any other office block in the Universe. 

In a room halfway up it, Zaphod Beeblebrox strode angrily. 

Roosta sat on the edge of the desk doing some routine towel 
maintenance. 

"Hey, where did you say this building was flying to?" demanded 
Zaphod. 

"The Frogstar," said Roosta, "the most totally evil place in the 
Universe." 

"Do they have food there?" said Zaphod. 

"Food? You're going to the Frogstar and you're worried about 
whether they got food?" 

"Without food I may not make it to the Frogstar." 



Out of the window, they could see nothing but the flickering light 
of the force beams, and vague green streaks which were presumably 
the distorted shapes of the Frogstar Fighters. At this speed, space 
itself was invisible, and indeed unreal. 

"Flere, suck this," said Roosta, offering Zaphod his towel. 

Zaphod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to leap out of his 
forehead on a small spring. 

"It's soaked in nutrients," explained Roosta. 

"What are you, a messy eater or something?" said Zaphod. 

"The yellow stripes are high in protein, the green ones have vitamin 
B and C complexes, the little pink flowers contain wheatgerm 
extracts." 

Zaphod took and looked at it in amazement. 

"What are the brown stains?" he asked. 

"Bar-B-Q sauce," said Roosta, "for when I get sick of wheatgerm." 

Zaphod sniffed it doubtfully. 

Even more doubtfully, he sucked a corner. Fie spat it out again. 

"Ugh," he stated. 

"Yes," said Roosta, "when I've had to suck that end I usually need 
to suck the other end a bit too." 

"Why," asked Zaphod suspiciously, "what's in that?" 

"Anti-depressants," said Roosta. 

"I've gone right off this towel, you know," said Zaphod handing it 
back. 

Roosta took it back from him, swung himself off the desk, walked 
round it, sat in the chair and put his feet up. 

"Beeblebrox," he said, sticking his hands behind his head, "have 
you any idea what's going to happen to you on the Frogstar?" 

"They're going to feed me?" hazarded Zaphod hopefully. 

"They're going to feed you," said Roosta, "into the Total 
Perspective Vortex!" 

Zaphod had never heard of this. Fie believed that he had heard of 
all the fun things in the Galaxy, so he assumed that the Total 
Perspective Vortex was not fun. Fie asked what it was. 



"Only," said Roosta, "the most savage psychic torture a sentinent 
being can undergo." 

Zaphod nodded a resigned nod. 

"So," he said, "no food, huh?" 

"Listen!" said Roosta urgently, "you can kill a man, destroy his body, 
break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can annihilate a 
man's soul! The treatment lasts seconds, but the effect lasts the rest 
of your life!" 

"You ever had a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster?" asked Zaphod sharply. 

"This is worse." 

"Phreeow!" admitted Zaphod, much impressed. 

"Any idea why these guys might want to do this to me?" he added 
a moment later. 

"They believe it will be the best way of destroying you for ever. 

They know what you're after." 

"Could they drop me a note and let me know as well?" 

"You know," said Roosta, "you know, Beeblebrox. You want to 
meet the man who rules the Universe." 

"Can he cook?" said Zaphod. On reflection he added: 

"I doubt if he can. If he could cook a good meal he wouldn't worry 
about the rest of the Universe. I want to meet a cook." 

Roosta sighed heavily. 

"What are you doing here anyway?" demanded Zaphod, "what's all 
this got to so with you?" 

"I'm just one of those who planned this thing, along with 
Zarniwoop, along with Yooden Vranx, along with your great 
grandfather, along with you, Beeblebrox." 

"Me?" 

"Yes, you. I was told you had changed, I didn't realize how much." 

"But..." 

"I am here to do one job. I will do it before I leave you." 

"What job, man, what are you talking about?" 

"I will do it before I leave you." 

Roosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence. 

Zaphod was terribly glad. 



Chapter 9 


The air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale 
and unwholesome. 

The dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over 
salt flats, dried up marshland, tangled and rotting vegetation and the 
crumbling remains of ruined cities. No life moved across its surface. 
The ground, like that of many planets in this part of the Galaxy, had 
long been deserted. 

The howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the 
old decaying houses of the cities; it was more desolate as it whipped 
about the bottoms of the tall black towers that swayed uneasily here 
and there about the surface of this world. At the top of these towers 
lived colonies of large, scraggy, evil smelling birds, the sole survivors 
of the civilization that once lived here. 

The howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however, when it 
passed over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey plain 
on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities. 

This pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world the 
reputation of being the most totally evil place in the Galaxy. From 
without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet across. From 
within it was something more monstrous than the mind can 
comprehend. 

About a hundred yards or so away, and separated from it by a 
pockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable 
was what would probably have to be described as a landing pad of 
sorts. That is to say that scattered over a largish area were the 
ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash-landed buildings. 

Flitting over and around these buildings was a mind, a mind that 
was waiting for something. 

The mind directed its attention into the air, and before very long a 
distant speck appeared, surrounded by a ring of smaller specks. 



The larger speck was the left-hand tower of the Hitchhiker's Guide 
to the Galaxy office building, descending through the stratosphere of 
Frogstar World B. 

As it descended, Roosta suddenly broke the long uncomfortable 
silence that had grown up between the two men. 

He stood up and gathered his towel into a bag. He said: 

"Beeblebrox, I will now do the job I was sent here to do." 

Zaphod looked up at him from where he was sitting in a corner 
sharing unspoken thoughts with Marvin. 

"Yeah?" he said. 

"The building will shortly be landing. When you leave the building, 
do not go out of the door," said Roosta, "go out of the window." 

"Good luck," he added, and walked out of the door, disappearing 
from Zaphod's life as mysteriously as he had entered it. 

Zaphod leapt up and tried the door, but Roosta had already locked 
it. He shrugged and returned to the corner. 

Two minutes later, the building crashlanded amongst the other 
wreckage. Its escort of Frogstar Fighters deactivated their force 
beams and soared off into the air again, bound for Frogstar World A, 
an altogether more congenial spot. They never landed on Frogstar 
World B. No one did. No one ever walked on its surface other than 
the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex. 

Zaphod was badly shaken by the crash. He lay for a while in the 
silent dusty rubble to which most of the room had been reduced. He 
felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in his life. He 
felt bewildered, he felt lonely, he felt unloved. Eventually he felt he 
ought to get whatever it was over with. 

He looked around the cracked and broken room. The wall had split 
round the door frame, and the door hung open. The window, by some 
miracle was closed and unbroken. For a while he hesitated, then he 
thought that if his strange and recent companion had been through 
all that he had been through just to tell him what he had told him, 
then there must be a good reason for it. With Marvin's help he got 
the window open. Outside it, the cloud of dust aroused by the crash, 
and the hulks of the other buildings with which this one was 
surrounded, effectively prevented Zaphod from seeing anything of 
the world outside. 



Not that this concerned him unduly. His main concern was what he 
saw when he looked down. Zarniwoop's office was on the fifteenth 
floor. The building had landed at a tilt of about forty-five degrees, but 
still the descent looked heart-stopping. 

Eventually, stung by the continuous series of contemptuous looks 
that Marvin appeared to be giving him, he took a deep breath and 
clambered out on to the steeply inclined side of the building. Marvin 
followed him, and together they began to crawl slowly and painfully 
down the fifteen floors that separated them from the ground. 

As he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs, his eyes 
smarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin. 

The occasional remark from Marvin of the order of "This is the sort 
of thing you lifeforms enjoy is it? I ask merely for information," did 
little to improve his state of mind. 

About half-way down the side of the shattered building they 
stopped to rest. It seemed to Zaphod as he lay there panting with fear 
and exhaustion that Marvin seemed a mite more cheerful than usual. 
Eventually he realized this wasn't so. The robot just seemed cheerful 
in comparison with his own mood. 

A large, scraggy black bird came flapping through the slowly 
settling clouds of dust and, stretching down its scrawny legs, landed 
on an inclined window ledge a couple of yards from Zaphod. It folded 
its ungainly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch. 

Its wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head 
and neck seemed curiously large for a bird. Its face was flat, the beak 
underdeveloped, and half-way along the underside of its wings the 
vestiges of something handlike could be clearly seen. 

In fact, it looked almost human. 

It turned its heavy eyes on Zaphod and clicked its beak in a 
desultory fashion. 

"Go away," said Zaphod. 

"OK," muttered the bird morosely and flapped off into the dust 
again. 

Zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment. 

"Did that bird just talk to me?" he asked Marvin nervously. He was 
quite prepared to believe the alternative explanation, that he was in 
fact hallucinating. 



"Yes," confirmed Marvin. 

"Poor souls," said a deep, ethereal voice in Zaphod's ear. 

Twisting round violently to find the source of the voice nearly 
caused Zaphod to fall off the building. He grabbed savagely at a 
protruding window fitting and cut his hand on it. He hung on, 
breathing heavily. 

The voice had no visible source whatever - there was no one there. 
Nevertheless, it spoke again. 

"A tragic history behind them, you know. A terrible blight." 

Zaphod looked wildly about. The voice was deep and quiet. In 
other circumstances it would even be described as soothing. There is, 
however, nothing soothing about being addressed by a disembodied 
voice out of nowhere, particularly if you are, like Zaphod Beeblebrox, 
not at your best and hanging from a ledge eight storeys up a crashed 
building. 

"Hey, er..." he stammered. 

"Shall I tell you their story?" inquired the voice quietly. 

"Hey, who are you?" panted Zaphod. "Where are you?" 

"Later then, perhaps," murmured the voice. "I am Gargravarr. I am 
the Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex." 

"Why can't I see..." 

"You will find your progress down the building greatly facilitated," 
the voice lifted, "if you move about two yards to your left. Why don't 
you try it?" 

Zaphod looked and saw a series of short horizontal grooves leading 
all the way down the side of the building. Gratefully he shifted himself 
across to them. 

"Why don't I see you again at the bottom?" said the voice in his ear, 
and as it spoke it faded. 

"Hey," called out Zaphod, "Where are you..." 

"It'll only take a couple of minutes..." said the voice very faintly. 

"Marvin," said Zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly 
next to him, "Did a... did a voice just..." 

"Yes," Marvin replied tersely. 

Zaphod nodded. He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses again. 
They were completely black, and by now quite badly scratched by the 



unexpected metal object in his pocket. He put them on. He would find 
his way down the building more comfortably if he didn't actually have 
to look at what he was doing. 

Minutes later he clambered over the ripped and mangled 
foundations of the building and, once more removing his sunglasses, 
he dropped to the ground. 

Marvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down in the 
dust and rubble, from which position he seemed too disinclined to 
move. 

"Ah, there you are," said the voice suddenly in Zaphod's ear, 
"excuse me leaving you like that, it's just that I have a terrible head 
for heights. At least," it added wistfully, "I did have a terrible head for 
heights." 

Zaphod looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he had 
missed something which might be the source of the voice. All he saw, 
however, was the dust, the rubble and the towering hulks of the 
encircling buildings. 

"Hey, er, why can't I see you?" he said, "why aren't you here?" 

"I am here," said the voice slowly, "my body wanted to come but 
it's a bit busy at the moment. Things to do, people to see." After what 
seemed like a sort of ethereal sigh it added, "You know how it is with 
bodies." 

Zaphod wasn't sure about this. 

"I thought I did," he said. 

"I only hope it's gone for a rest cure," continued the voice, "the 
way it's been living recently it must be on its last elbows." 

"Elbows?" said Zaphod, "don't you mean last legs?" 

The voice said nothing for a while. Zaphod looked around uneasily. 
He didn't know if it was gone or was still there or what it was doing. 
Then the voice spoke again. 

"So, you are to be put into the Vortex, yes?" 

"Er, well," said Zaphod with a very poor attempt at nonchalance, 
"this cat's in no hurry, you know. I can just slouch about and take in a 
look at the local scenery, you know?" 

"Have you seen the local scenery?" asked the voice of Gargravarr. 

"Er, no." 



Zaphod clambered over the rubble, and rounded the corner of one 
of the wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view. 

He looked out at the landscape of Frogstar World B. 

"Ah, OK," he said, "I'll just sort of slouch about then." 

"No," said Gargravarr, "the Vortex is ready for you now. You must 
come. Follow me." 

"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, "and how am I meant to do that?" 

"I'll hum for you," said Gargravarr, "follow the humming." 

A soft keening sound drifted through the air, a pale, sad sound that 
seemed to be without any kind of focus. It was only by listening very 
carefully that Zaphod was able to detect the direction from which it 
was coming. Slowly, dazedly, he stumbled off in its wake. What else 
was there to do? 



Chapter 10 


The Universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big 
place, a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend to 
ignore. 

Many would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their 
own devising, and this is what most beings in fact do. 

For instance, in one corner of the Eastern Galactic Arm lies the 
large forest planet Oglaroon, the entire "intelligent" population of 
which lives permanently in one fairly small and crowded nut tree. In 
which tree they are born, live, fall in love, carve tiny speculative 
articles in the bark on the meaning of life, the futility of death and the 
importance of birth control, fight a few extremely minor wars, and 
eventually die strapped to the underside of some of the less 
accessible outer branches. 

In fact the only Oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those 
who are hurled out of it for the heinous crime of wondering whether 
any of the other trees might be capable of supporting life at all, or 
indeed whether the other trees are anything other than illusions 
brought on by eating too many Oglanuts. 

Exotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life form in the 
Galaxy which is not in some way guilty of the same thing, which is 
why the Total Perspective Vortex is as horrific as it is. 

For when you are put into the Vortex you are given just one 
momentary glimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of creation, 
and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic dot on a 
microscopic dot, which says "You are here." 

The grey plain stretched before Zaphod, a ruined, shattered plain. 
The wind whipped wildly over it. 

Visible in the middle was the steel pimple of the dome. This, 
gathered Zaphod, was where he was going. This was the Total 
Perspective Vortex. 



As he stood and gazed bleakly at it, a sudden inhuman wail of 
terror emanated from it as of a man having his soul burnt from his 
body. It screamed above the wind and died away. 

Zaphod started with fear and his blood seemed to turn to liquid 
helium. 

"Hey, what was that?" he muttered voicelessly. 

"A recording," said Gargravarr, "of the last man who was put in the 
Vortex. It is always played to the next victim. A sort of prelude." 

"Hey, it really sounds bad..." stammered Zaphod, "couldn't we 
maybe slope off to a party or something for a while, think it over?" 

"For all I know," said Gargravarr's ethereal voice, "I'm probably at 
one. My body that is. It goes to a lot of parties without me. Says I only 
get in the way. Hey ho." 

"What is all this with your body?" said Zaphod, anxious to delay 
whatever it was that was going to happen to him. 

"Well, it's... it's busy you know," said Gargravarr hesitantly. 

"You mean it's got a mind of its own?" said Zaphod. 

There was a long and slightly chilly pause before Gargravarr spoke 
again. 

"I have to say," he replied eventually, "that I find that remark in 
rather poor taste." 

Zaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology. 

"No matter," said Gargravarr, "you weren't to know." 

The voice fluttered unhappily. 

"The truth is," it continued in tones which suggested he was trying 
very hard to keep it under control, "the truth is that we are currently 
undergoing a period of legal trial separation. I suspect it will end in 
divorce." 

The voice was still again, leaving Zaphod with no idea of what to 
say. He mumbled uncertainly. 

"I think we are probably not very well suited," said Gargravarr 
again at length, "we never seemed to be happy doing the same things. 
We always had the greatest arguments over sex and fishing. 

Eventually we tried to combine the two, but that only led to disaster, 
as you can probably imagine. And now my body refuses to let me in. It 
won't even see me..." 



He paused again, tragically. The wind whipped across the plain. 

"It says I only inhibit it. I pointed out that in fact I was meant to 
inhibit it, and it said that that was exactly the sort of smart alec 
remark that got right up a body's left nostril, and so we left it. It will 
probably get custody of my forename." 

"Oh..." said Zaphod faintly, "and what's that?" 

"Pizpot," said the voice, "My name is Pizpot Gargravarr. Says it all 
really doesn't it?" 

"Errr..." said Zaphod sympathetically. 

"And that is why I, as a disembodied mind, have this job. Custodian 
of the Total Perspective Vortex. No one will ever walk on the ground 
of this planet. Except the victims of the Vortex - they don't really 
count I'm afraid." 

"Ah..." 

"I'll tell you the story. Would you like to hear it?" 

"Er..." 

"Many years ago this was a thriving, happy planet - people, cities 
shops, a normal world. Except that on the high streets of these cities 
there were slightly more shoe shops than one might have thought 
necessary. And slowly, insidiously, the numbers of these shoe shops 
were increasing. It's a well known economic phenomenon but tragic 
to see it in operation, for the more shoe shops there were, the more 
shoes they had to make and the worse and more unwearable they 
became. And the worse they were to wear, the more people had to 
buy to keep themselves shod, and the more the shops proliferated, 
until the whole economy of the place passed what I believe is termed 
the Shoe Event Horizon, and it became no longer economically 
possible to build anything other than shoe shops. Result - collapse, 
ruin and famine. Most of the population died out. Those few who had 
the right kind of genetic instability mutated into birds - you've seen 
one of them - who cursed their feet, cursed the ground, and vowed 
that none should walk on it again. Unhappy lot. Come, I must take you 
to the Vortex." 

Zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled forward 
across the plain. 

"And you," he said, "you come from this hellhole pit do you?" 



"No no," said Gargravarr, taken aback, "I come from the Frogstar 
World C. Beautiful place. Wonderful fishing. I flit back there in the 
evenings. Though all I can do now is watch. The Total Perspective 
Vortex is the only thing on this planet with any function. It was built 
here because no one else wanted it on their doorstep." 

At that moment another dismal scream rent the air and Zaphod 
shuddered. 

"What can do that to a guy?" he breathed. 

"The Universe," said Gargravarr simply, "the whole infinite 
Universe. The infinite suns, the infinite distances between them, and 
yourself an invisible dot on an invisible dot, infinitely small." 

"Hey, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, man, you know," muttered Zaphod 
trying to flap the last remnants of his ego. 

Gargravarr made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful 
humming till they reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of 
the plain. 

As they reached it, a door hummed open in the side, revealing a 
small darkened chamber within. 

"Enter," said Gargravarr. 

Zaphod started with fear. 

"Hey, what, now?" he said. 

"Now." 

Zaphod peered nervously inside. The chamber was very small. It 
was steel-lined and there was hardly space in it for more than one 
man. 

"It... er... it doesn't look like any kind of Vortex to me," said Zaphod. 

"It isn't," said Gargravarr, "it's just the elevator. Enter." 

With infinite trepidation Zaphod stepped into it. He was aware of 
Gargravarr being in the elevator with him, though the disembodied 
man was not for the moment speaking. 

The elevator began its descent. 

"I must get myself into the right frame of mind for this," muttered 
Zaphod. 

"There is no right frame of mind," said Gargravarr sternly. 

"You really know how to make a guy feel inadequate." 

"I don't. The Vortex does." 



At the bottom of the shaft, the rear of the elevator opened up and 
Zaphod stumbled out into a smallish, functional, steel-lined chamber. 

At the far side of it stood a single upright steel box, just large 
enough for a man to stand in. 

It was that simple. 

It connected to a small pile of components and instruments via a 
single thick wire. 

"Is that it?" said Zaphod in surprise. 

"That is it." 

Didn't look too bad, thought Zaphod. 

"And I get in there do I?" said Zaphod. 

"You get in there," said Gargravarr, "and I'm afraid you must do it 
now." 

"OK, OK," said Zaphod. 

He opened the door of the box and stepped in. 

Inside the box he waited. 

After five seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was 
there in the box with him. 



Chapter 11 


The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole 
Universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses. 

To explain - since every piece of matter in the Universe is in some 
way affected by every other piece of matter in the Universe, it is in 
theory possible to extrapolate the whole of creation - every sun, 
every planet, their orbits, their composition and their economic and 
social history from, say, one small piece of fairy cake. 

The man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so basically 
in order to annoy his wife. 

Trin Tragula - for that was his name - was a dreamer, a thinker, a 
speculative philosopher or, as his wife would have it, an idiot. 

And she would nag him incessantly about the utterly inordinate 
amount of time he spent staring out into space, or mulling over the 
mechanics of safety pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of pieces 
of fairy cake. 

"Have some sense of proportion!" she would say, sometimes as 
often as thirty-eight times in a single day. 

And so he built the Total Perspective Vortex - just to show her. 

And into one end he plugged the whole of reality as extrapolated 
from a piece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his wife: 
so that when he turned it on she saw in one instant the whole infinity 
of creation and herself in relation to it. 

To Trin Tragula's horror, the shock completely annihilated her brain 
but to his satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that 
if life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it 
cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion. 


The door of the Vortex swung open. 



From his disembodied mind Gargravarr watched dejectedly. He had 
rather liked Zaphod Beeblebrox in a strange sort of way. He was 
clearly a man of many qualities, even if they were mostly bad ones. 

He waited for him to flop forwards out of the box, as they all did. 

Instead, he stepped out. 

"Hi!" he said. 

"Beeblebrox..." gasped Gargravarr's mind in amazement. 

"Could I have a drink please?" said Zaphod. 

"You... you... have been in the Vortex?" stammered Gargravarr. 

"You saw me, kid." 

"And it was working?" 

"Sure was." 

"And you saw the whole infinity of creation?" 

"Sure. Really neat place, you know that?" 

Gargravarr's mind was reeling in astonishment. Had his body been 
with him it would have sat down heavily with its mouth hanging open. 

"And you saw yourself," said Gargravarr, "in relation to it all?" 

"Oh, yeah, yeah." 

"But... what did you experience?" 

Zaphod shrugged smugly. 

"It just told me what I knew all the time. I'm a really terrific and 
great guy. Didn't I tell you, baby, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox!" 

His gaze passed over the machinery which powered the vortex and 
suddenly stopped, startled. 

He breathed heavily. 

"Hey," he said, "is that really a piece of fairy cake?" 

He ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors with 
which it was surrounded. 

"If I told you how much I needed this," he said ravenously, "I 
wouldn't have time to eat it." 


He ate it. 



Chapter 12 


A short while later he was running across the plain in the direction 
of the ruined city. 

The dank air wheezed heavily in his lungs and he frequently 
stumbled with the exhaustion he was still feeling. Night was beginning 
to fall too, and the rough ground was treacherous. 

The elation of his recent experience was still with him though. The 
whole Universe. He had seen the whole Universe stretching to infinity 
around him - everything. And with it had come the clear and 
extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing in it. 
Having a conceited ego is one thing. Actually being told by a machine 
is another. 

He didn't have time to reflect on this matter. 

Gargravarr had told him that he would have to alert his masters as 
to what had happened, but that he was prepared to leave a decent 
interval before doing so. Enough time for Zaphod to make a break and 
find somewhere to hide. 

What he was going to do he didn't know, but feeling that he was 
the most important person in the Universe gave him the confidence 
to believe that something would turn up. 

Nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much grounds 
for optimism. 

He ran on, and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city. 

He walked along cracked and gaping roads riddled with scrawny 
weeds, the holes filled with rotting shoes. The buildings he passed 
were so crumbled and decrepit he thought it unsafe to enter any of 
them. Where could he hide? He hurried on. 

After a while the remains of a wide sweeping road led off from the 
one down which he was walking, and at its end lay a vast low building, 
surrounded with sundry smaller ones, the whole surrounded by the 
remains of a perimeter barrier. The large main building still seemed 



reasonably solid, and Zaphod turned off to see if it might provide him 
with... well with anything. 

He approached the building. Along one side of it - the front it 
would seem since it faced a wide concreted apron area - were three 
gigantic doors, maybe sixty feet high. The far one of these was open, 
and towards this, Zaphod ran. 

Inside, all was gloom, dust and confusion. Giant cobwebs lay over 
everything. Part of the infrastructure of the building had collapsed, 
part of the rear wall had caved in, and a thick choking dust lay inches 
over the floor. 

Through the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed, covered with 
debris. 

The shapes were sometimes cylindrical, sometimes bulbous, 
sometimes like eggs, or rather cracked eggs. Most of them were split 
open or falling apart, some were mere skeletons. 

They were all spacecraft, all derelict. 

Zaphod wandered in frustration among the hulks. There was 
nothing here that remotely approached the serviceable. Even the 
mere vibration of his footsteps caused one precarious wreck to 
collapse further into itself. 

Towards the rear of the building lay one old ship, slightly larger 
than the others, and buried beneath even deeper piles of dust and 
cobwebs. Its outline, however, seemed unbroken. Zaphod 
approached it with interest, and as he did so, he tripped over an old 
feedline. 

He tried to toss the feedline aside, and to his surprise discovered 
that it was still connected to the ship. 

To his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was also 
humming slightly. 

He stared at the ship in disbelief, and then back down at the 
feedline in his hands. 

He tore off his jacket and threw it aside. Crawling along on his 
hands and knees he followed the feedline to the point where it 
connected with the ship. The connection was sound, and the slight 
humming vibration was more distinct. 



His heart was beating fast. He wiped away some grime and laid an 
ear against the ship's side. He could only hear a faint, indeterminate 
noise. 

He rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor all 
about him and found a short length of tubing, and a non- 
biodegradable plastic cup. Out of this he fashioned a crude 
stethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship. 

What he heard made his brains turn somersaults. 

The voice said: 

"Transtellar Cruise Lines would like to apologize to passengers for 
the continuing delay to this flight. We are currently awaiting the 
loading of our complement of small lemon-soaked paper napkins for 
your comfort, refreshment and hygiene during the journey. 

Meanwhile we thank you for your patience. The cabin crew will 
shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again." 

Zaphod staggered backwards, staring wildly at the ship. 

He walked around for a few moments in a daze. In so doing he 
suddenly caught sight of a giant departure board still hanging, but by 
only one support, from the ceiling above him. It was covered with 
grime, but some of the figures were still discernible. 

Zaphod's eyes searched amongst the figures, then made some brief 
calculations. His eyes widened. 

"Nine hundred years..." he breathed to himself. That was how late 
the ship was. 

Two minutes later he was on board. 

As he stepped out of the airlock, the air that greeted him was cool 
and fresh - the air conditioning was still working. 

The lights were still on. 

He moved out of the small entrance chamber into a short narrow 
corridor and stepped nervously down it. 

Suddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him. 

"Please return to your seat sir," said the android stewardess and, 
turning her back on him, she walked on down the corridor in front of 
him. 

When his heart had started beating again he followed her. She 
opened the door at the end of the corridor and walked through. 



He followed her through the door. 

They were now in the passenger compartment and Zaphod's heart 
stopped still again for a moment. 

In every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat. 

The passengers' hair was long and unkempt, their fingernails were 
long, the men wore beards. 

All of them were quite clearly alive - but sleeping. 

Zaphod had the creeping horrors. 

He walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream. By the time he was 
half-way down the aisle, the stewardess had reached the other end. 
She turned and spoke. 

"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen," she said sweetly, "Thank 
you for bearing with us during this slight delay. We will be taking off 
as soon as we possibly can. If you would like to wake up now I will 
serve you coffee and biscuits." 

There was a slight hum. 

At that moment, all the passengers awoke. 

They awoke screaming and clawing at their straps and life support 
systems that held them tightly in their seats. They screamed and 
bawled and hollered till Zaphod thought his ears would shatter. 

They struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently moved up 
the aisle placing a small cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits in front 
of each one of them. 

Then one of them rose from his seat. 

He turned and looked at Zaphod. 

Zaphod's skin was crawling all over his body as if it was trying to get 
off. He turned and ran from the bedlam. 

He plunged through the door and back into the corridor. 

The man pursued him. 

He raced in a frenzy to the end of the corridor, through the 
entrance chamber and beyond. He arrived on the flight deck, 
slammed and bolted the door behind him. He leant back against the 
door breathing hard. 

Within seconds, a hand started beating on the door. 

From somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him. 



"Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck. Please return to 
your seat, and wait for the ship to take off. Coffee and biscuits are 
being served. This is your autopilot speaking. Please return to your 
seat." 

Zaphod said nothing. He breathed hard, behind him, the hand 
continued to knock on the door. 

"Please return to your seat," repeated the autopilot. "Passengers 
are not allowed on the flight deck." 

"I'm not a passenger," panted Zaphod. 

"Please return to your seat." 

"I am not a passenger!" shouted Zaphod again. 

"Please return to your seat." 

"I am not a... hello, can you hear me?" 

"Please return to your seat." 

You're the autopilot?" said Zaphod. 

"Yes," said the voice from the flight console. 

"You're in charge of this ship?" 

"Yes," said the voice again, "there has been a delay. Passengers are 
to be kept temporarily in suspended animation, for their comfort and 
convenience. Coffee and biscuits are being served every year, after 
which passengers are returned to suspended animation for their 
continued comfort and convenience. Departure will take place when 
the flight stores are complete. We apologize for the delay." 

Zaphod moved away from the door, on which the pounding had 
now ceased. He approached the flight console. 

"Delay?" he cried, "Have you seen the world outside this ship? It's a 
wasteland, a desert. Civilization's been and gone, man. There are no 
lemon-soaked paper napkins on the way from anywhere!" 

"The statistical likelihood," continued the autopilot primly, "is that 
other civilizations will arise. There will one day be lemon-soaked 
paper napkins. Till then there will be a short delay. Please return to 
your seat." 

"But..." 

But at that moment the door opened. Zaphod span round to see 
the man who had pursued him standing there. He carried a large 




briefcase. He was smartly dressed, and his hair was short. He had no 
beard and no long fingernails. 

"Zaphod Beeblebrox," he said, "My name is Zarniwoop. I believe 
you wanted to see me." 

Zaphod Beeblebrox wittered. His mouths said foolish things. He 
dropped into a chair. 

"Oh man, oh man, where did you spring from?" he said. 

"I've been waiting here for you," he said in a businesslike tone. 

He put the briefcase down and sat in another chair. 

"I am glad you followed instructions," he said, "I was a bit nervous 
that you might have left my office by the door rather than the 
window. Then you would have been in trouble." 

Zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled. 

"When you entered the door of my office, you entered my 
electronically synthesized Universe," he explained, "if you had left by 
the door you would have been back in the real one. The artificial one 
works from here." 

He patted the briefcase smugly. 

Zaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing. 

"What's the difference?" he muttered. 

"Nothing," said Zarniwoop, "they are identical. Oh - except that I 
think the Frogstar Fighters are grey in the real Universe." 

"What's going on?" spat Zaphod. 

"Simple," said Zarniwoop. His self assurance and smugness made 
Zaphod seethe. 

"Very simple," repeated Zarniwoop, "I discovered the coordinated 
at which this man could be found - the man who rules the Universe, 
and discovered that his world was protected by an Unprobability field. 
To protect my secret - and myself - I retreated to the safety of this 
totally artificial Universe and hid myself away in a forgotten cruise 
liner. I was secure. Meanwhile, you and I..." 

"You and I?" said Zaphod angrily, "you mean I knew you?" 

"Yes," said Zarniwoop, "we knew each other well." 

"I had no taste," said Zaphod and resumed a sullen silence. 

"Meanwhile, you and I arranged that you would steal the 
Improbability Drive ship - the only one which could reach the ruler's 



world - and bring it to me here. This you have now done I trust, and I 
congratulate you." He smiled a tight little smile which Zaphod wanted 
to hit with a brick. 

"Oh, and in case you were wondering," added Zarniwoop, "this 
Universe was created specifically for you to come to. You are 
therefore the most important person in this Universe. You would 
never," he said with an even more brickable smile, "have survived the 
Total Perspective Vortex in the real one. Shall we go?" 

"Where?" said Zaphod sullenly. He felt collapsed. 

"To your ship. The Heart of Gold. You did bring it I trust?" 

"No." 

"Where is your jacket?" 

Zaphod looked at him in mystification. 

"My jacket? I took it off. It's outside." 

"Good, we will go and find it." 

Zarniwoop stood up and gestured to Zaphod to follow him. 

Out in the entrance chamber again, they could hear the screams of 
the passengers being fed coffee and biscuits. 

"It has not been a pleasant experience waiting for you," said 
Zarniwoop. 

"Not pleasant for you!" bawled Zaphod, "How do you think..." 

Zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung open. 
A few feet away from them they could see Zaphod's jacket lying in the 
debris. 

"A very remarkable and very powerful ship," said Zarniwoop, 
"watch." 

As they watched, the pocket on the jacket suddenly bulged. It split, 
it ripped. The small metal model of the Heart of Gold that Zaphod had 
been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing. 

It grew, it continued to grow. It reached, after two minutes, its full 
size. 

"At an Improbability Level," said Zarniwoop, "of... oh I don't know, 
but something very large." 

Zaphod swayed. 

"You mean I had it with me all the time?" 

"Zarniwoop smiled. He lifted up his briefcase and opened it. 



He twisted a single switch inside it. 

"Goodbye artificial Universe," he said, "hello real one!" 

The scene before them shimmered briefly - and reappeared 
exactly as before. 

"You see?" said Zarniwoop, "exactly the same." 

"You mean," repeated Zaphod tautly, "that I had it with me all the 
time?" 

"Oh yes," said Zarniwoop, "of course. That was the whole point." 

"That's it," said Zaphod, "you can count me out, from hereon in you 
can count me out. I've had all I want of this. You play your own 
games." 

"I'm afraid you cannot leave," said Zarniwoop, "you are entwined 
in the Improbability field. You cannot escape." 

He smiled the smile that Zaphod had wanted to hit and this time 
Zaphod hit it. 



Chapter 13 


Ford Prefect bounded up to the bridge of the Heart of Gold. 

"Trillian! Arthur!" he shouted, "it's working! The ship's 
reactivated!" 

Trillian and Arthur were asleep on the floor. 

"Come on you guys, we're going off, we're off," he said kicking 
them awake. 

"Hi there guys!" twittered the computer, "it's really great to be 
back with you again, I can tell you, and I just want to say that..." 

"Shut up," said Ford, "tell us where the hell we are." 

"Frogstar World B, and man it's a dump," said Zaphod running on 
to the bridge, "hi, guys, you must be so amazingly glad to see me you 
don't even find words to tell me what a cool frood I am." 

"What a what?" said Arthur blearily, picking himself up from the 
floor and not taking any of this in. 

"I know how you feel," said Zaphod, "I'm so great even I get 
tongue-tied talking to myself. Hey it's good to see you Trillian, Ford, 
Monkeyman. Hey, er, computer...?" 

"Hi there, Mr. Beeblebrox sir, sure is a great honor to..." 

"Shut up and get us out of here, fast fast fast." 

"Sure thing, fella, where do you want to go?" 

"Anywhere, doesn't matter," shouted Zaphod, "yes it does!" he 
said again, "we want to go to the nearest place to eat!" 

"Sure thing," said the computer happily and a massive explosion 
rocket the bridge. 

When Zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye, he 
regarded the four wisps of smoke with interest. 



Chapter 14 


Four inert bodies sank through spinning blackness. Consciousness 
had died, cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the pit 
of unbeing. The roar of silence echoed dismally around them and they 
sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red that slowly 
engulfed them, seemingly for ever. 

After what seemed an eternity the sea receded and left them lying 
on a cold hard shore, the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of Life, the 
Universe, and Everything. 

Cold spasms shook them, lights danced sickeningly around them. 
The cold hard shore tipped and span and then stood still. It shone 
darkly - it was a very highly polished cold hard shore. 

A green blur watched them disapprovingly. 

It coughed. 

"Good evening, madam, gentlemen," it said, "do you have a 
reservation?" 

Ford Prefect's consciousness snapped back like elastic, making his 
brain smart. Fie looked up woozily at the green blur. 

"Reservation?" he said weakly. 

"Yes, sir," said the green blur. 

"Do you need a reservation for the afterlife?" 

In so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows 
disdainfully, this is what the green blur now did. 

"Afterlife, sir?" it said. 

Arthur Dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one 
grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath. 

"Is this the afterlife?" he stammered. 

"Well I assume so," said Ford Prefect trying to work out which way 
was up. Fie tested the theory that it must lie in the opposite direction 
from the cold hard shore on which he was lying, and staggered to 
what he hoped were his feet. 



"I mean," he said, swaying gently, "there's no way we could have 
survived that blast is there?" 

"No," muttered Arthur. He had raised himself on to his elbows but 
it didn't seem to improve things. He slumped down again. 

"No," said Trillian, standing up, "no way at all." 

A dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor. It was Zaphod 
Beeblebrox attempting to speak. "I certainly didn't survive," he 
gurgled, "I was a total goner. Wham bang and that was it." 

"Yeah, thanks to you," said Ford, "We didn't stand a chance. We 
must have been blown to bits. Arms, legs everywhere." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod struggling noisily to his feet. 

"If the lady and gentlemen would like to order drinks..." said the 
green blur, hovering impatiently beside them. 

"Kerpow, splat," continued Zaphod, "instantaneously zonked into 
our component molecules. Hey, Ford," he said, identifying one of the 
slowly solidifying blurs around him, "did you get that thing of your 
whole life flashing before you?" 

"You got that too?" said Ford, "your whole life?" 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, "at least I assume it was mine. I spent a lot of 
time out of my skulls you know." 

He looked at around him at the various shapes that were at last 
becoming proper shapes instead of vague and wobbling shapeless 
shapes. 

"So..." he said. 

"So what?" said Ford. 

"So here we are," said Zaphod hesitantly, "lying dead..." 

"Standing," Trillian corrected him. 

"Er, standing dead," continued Zaphod, "in this desolate..." 

"Restaurant," said Arthur Dent who had got to his feet and could 
now, much to his surprise, see clearly. That is to say, the thing that 
surprised him was not that he could see, but what he could see. 

"Here we are," continued Zaphod doggedly, "standing dead in this 
desolate..." 

"Five star..." said Trillian. 

"Restaurant," concluded Zaphod. 

"Odd isn't it?" said Ford. 



"Er, yeah." 

"Nice chandeliers though," said Trillian. 

They looked about themselves in bemusement. 

"It's not so much an afterlife," said Arthur, "more a sort of apres 
vie." 

The chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and the low 
vaulted ceiling from which they hung would not, in an ideal Universe, 
have been painted in that particular shade of deep turquoise, and 
even if it had been it wouldn't have been highlighted by concealed 
moodlighting. This is not, however, an ideal Universe, as was further 
evidenced by the eye-crossing patterns of the inlaid marble floor, and 
the way in which the fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped 
bar had been made. The fronting for the eighty-yard long marble- 
topped bar had been made by stitching together nearly twenty 
thousand Antarean Mosaic Lizard skins, despite the fact that the 
twenty thousand lizards concerned had needed them to keep their 
insides in. 

A few smartly dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar 
or relaxing in the richly coloured body-hugging seats that were 
deployed here and there about the bar area. A young VI'Hurg officer 
and his green steaming young lady passed through the large smoked 
glass doors at the far end of the bar into the dazzling light of the main 
body of the Restaurant beyond. 

Behind Arthur was a large curtained bay window. He pulled aside 
the corner of the curtain and looked out at a landscape which under 
normal circumstances would have given Arthur the creeping horrors. 
These were not, however, normal circumstances, for the thing that 
froze his blood and made his skin try to crawl up his back and off the 
top of his head was the sky. The sky was... 

An attendant flunkey politely drew the curtain back into place. 

"All in good time, sir," he said. 

Zaphod's eyes flashed. 

"Hey, hang about you dead guys," he said, "I think we're missing 
some ultra-important thing here you know. Something somebody said 
and we missed it." 

Arthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he 
had just seen. 



He said, "I said it was a sort of apres..." 

"Yeah, and don't you wish you hadn't?" said Zaphod, "Ford?" 

"I said it was odd." 

"Yeah, shrewd but dull, perhaps it was..." 

"Perhaps," interrupted the green blur who had by this time 
resolved into the shape of a small wizened dark-suited green waiter, 
"perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks..." 

"Drinks!" cried Zaphod, "that was it! See what you miss if you don't 
stay alert." 

"Indeed sir," said the waiter patiently. "If the lady and gentlemen 
would care to order drinks before dinner..." 

"Dinner!" Zaphod exclaimed with passion, "Listen, little green 
person, my stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night for 
the mere idea." 

"... and the Universe," concluded the waiter, determined not to be 
deflected on his home stretch, "will explode later for your pleasure." 

Ford's head swivelled towards him. He spoke with feeling. 

"Wow," he said, "What sort of drinks do you serve in this place?" 

The waiter laughed a polite little waiter's laugh. 

"Ah," he said, "I think sir has perhaps misunderstood me." 

"Oh, I hope not," breathed Ford. 

The waiter coughed a polite little waiter's cough. 

"It is not unusual for our customers to be a little disoriented by the 
time journey," he said, "so if I might suggest..." 

"Time journey?" said Zaphod. 

"Time journey?" said Ford. 

"Time journey?" said Trillian. 

"You mean this isn't the afterlife?" said Arthur. 

The waiter smiled a polite little waiter's smile. He had almost 
exhausted his polite little waiter repertoire and would soon be 
slipping into his role of a rather tight lipped and sarcastic little waiter. 

"Afterlife sir?" he said, "No sir." 

"And we're not dead?" said Arthur. 

The waiter tightened his lips. 



"Aha, ha," he said, "Sir is most evidently alive, otherwise I would 
not attempt to serve sir." 

In an extraordinary gesture which is pointless attempting to 
describe, Zaphod Beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two of 
his arms and one of his thighs with the other. 

"Hey guys," he said, "This is crazy. We finally did it. We finally got 
to where we were going. This is Milliways!" 

"Yes sir," said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel, "this 
is Milliways - the Restaurant at the End of the Universe." 

"End of what?" said Arthur. 

"The Universe," repeated the waiter, very clearly and unnecessarily 
distinctly. 

"When did that end?" said Arthur. 

"In just a few minutes, sir," said the waiter. He took a deep breath. 
He didn't need to do this since his body was supplied with the 
peculiar assortment of gases it required for survival from a small 
intravenous device strapped to his leg. There are times, however, 
when whatever your metabolism you have to take a deep breath. 

"Now, if you would care to order drinks at last," he said, "I will then 
show you to your table." 

Zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over to the bar and 
bought most of it. 



Chapter 15 


The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most 
extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. It has been 
built on the fragmented remains of... it will be built on the 
fragmented... that is to say it will have been built by this time, and 
indeed has been - 

One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that 
of accidentally becoming your own father or mother. There is no 
problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a 
broadminded and well-adjusted family can't cope with. There is also 
no problem about changing the course of history - the course of 
history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All 
the important changes have happened before the things they were 
supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end. 

The major problem is quite simply one of grammar, and the main 
work to consult in this matter is Dr. Dan Streetmentioner's Time 
Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will tell you for 
instance how to describe something that was about to happen to you 
in the past before you avoided it by time - jumping forward two days 
in order to avoid it. The event will be described differently according 
to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own 
natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further 
past and is further complicated by the possibility of conducting 
conversations whilst you are actually travelling from one time to 
another with the intention of becoming your own father or mother. 

Most readers get as far as the Future Semi-Conditionally Modified 
Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up: and 
in fact in later editions of the book all the pages beyond this point 
have been left blank to save on printing costs. 

The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy skips lightly over this tangle of 
academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the term "Future 
Perfect" has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be. 



To resume: 

The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most 
extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. 

It is built on the fragmented remains of an eventually ruined planet 
which is (wioll haven be) enclosed in a vast time bubble and projected 
forward in time to the precise moment of the End of the Universe. 

This is, many would say, impossible. 

In it, guests take (willan on-take) their places at table and eat 
(willan on-eat) sumptuous meals whilst watching (willing watchen) 
the whole of creation explode around them. 

This is, many would say, equally impossible. 

You can arrive (mayan arivan on-when) for any sitting you like 
without prior (late fore-when) reservation because you can book 
retrospectively, as it were when you return to your own time, (you 
can have on-book haventa forewhen presooning returningwenta 
retrohome.) 

This is, many would now insist, absolutely impossible. 

At the Restaurant you can meet and dine with (mayan meetan con 
with dinan on when) a fascinating cross-section of the entire 
population of space and time. 

This, it can be explained patiently, is also impossible. 

You can visit it as many times as you like (mayan on-visit re- 
onvisiting... and so on-for further tense-corrections consult Dr. 
Streetmentioner's book) and be sure of never meeting yourself, 
because of the embarrassment this usually causes. 

This, even if the rest were true, which it isn't, is patently impossible, 
say the doubters. 

All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in your 
own era, and when you arrive at the End of Time the operation of 
compound interest means that the fabulous cost of your meal has 
been paid for. 

This, many claim, is not merely impossible but clearly insane, which 
is why the advertising executives of the star system of Bastablon 
came up with this slogan: "If you've done six impossible things this 
morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways, the 
Restaurant at the End of the Universe?" 



Chapter 16 


At the bar, Zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a newt. His 
heads knocked together and his smiles were coming out of synch. He 
was miserably happy. 

"Zaphod," said Ford, "whilst you're still capable of speech, would 
you care to tell me what the photon happened? Where have you 
been? Where have we been? Small matter, but I'd like it cleared up." 

Zaphod's left head sobered up, leaving his right to sink further into 
the obscurity of drink. 

"Yeah," he said, "I've been around. They want me to find the man 
who rules the Universe, but I don't care to meet him. I believe the 
man can't cook." 

His left head watched his right head saying this and then nodded. 

"True," it said, "have another drink." 

Ford had another Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, the drink which has 
been described as the alcoholic equivalent of a mugging-expensive 
and bad for the head. Whatever had happened, Ford decided, he 
didn't really care too much. 

"Listen Ford," said Zaphod, "everything's cool and froody." 

"You mean everything's under control." 

"No," said Zaphod, "I do not mean everything's under control. That 
would not be cool and froody. If you want to know what happened 
let's just say I had the whole situation in my pocket. OK?" 

Ford shrugged. 

Zaphod giggled into his drink. It frothed up over the side of the 
glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar top. 

A wild-skinned sky-gypsy approached them and played electric 
violin at them until Zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed to 
go away again. 

The gypsy approached Arthur and Trillian sitting in another part of 
the bar. 



"I don't know what this place is," said Arthur, "but I think it gives 
me the creeps." 

"Have another drink," said Trillian, "Enjoy yourself." 

"Which?" said Arthur, "the two are mutually exclusive." 

"Poor Arthur, you're not really cut out for this life are you?" 

"You call this life?" 

"You're beginning to sound like Marvin." 

"Marvin's the clearest thinker I know. How do you think we make 
this violinist go away?" 

The waiter approached. 

"Your table is ready," he said. 

Seen from the outside, which it never is, the Restaurant resembles 
a giant glittering starfish beached on a forgotten rock. Each of its arms 
houses the bars, the kitchens, the forcefield generators which protect 
the entire structure and the decayed planet on which it sits, and the 
Time Turbines which slowly rock the whole affair backwards and 
forwards across the crucial moment. 

In the centre sits the gigantic golden dome, almost a complete 
globe, and it was into this area that Zaphod, Ford, Arthur and Trillian 
now passed. 

At least five tons of glitter alone had gone into it before them, and 
covered every available surface. The other surfaces were not available 
because they were already encrusted with jewels, precious sea shells 
from Santraginus, gold leaf, mosaic tiles, lizard skins and a million 
unidentifiable embellishments and decorations. Glass glittered, silver 
shone, gold gleamed, Arthur Dent goggled. 

"Wowee," said Zaphod, "Zappo." 

"Incredible!" breathed Arthur, "the people...! The things...!" 

"The things," said Ford Prefect quietly, "are also people." 

"The people..." resumed Arthur, "the... other people..." 

"The lights...!" said Trillian. 

"The tables..." said Arthur. 

"The clothes...!" said Trillian. 

The waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs. 

"The End of the Universe is very popular," said Zaphod threading 
his way unsteadily through the throng of tables, some made of 



marble, some of rich ultra-mahagony, some even of platinum, and at 
each a party of exotic creatures chatting amongst themselves a nd 
studying menus. 

"People like to dress up for it," continued Zaphod, "Gives it a sense 
of occasion." 

The tables were fanned out in a large circle around a central stage 
area where a small band were playing light music, at least a thousand 
tables was Arthur's guess, and interspersed amongst them were 
swaying palms, hissing fountains, grotesque statuary, in short all the 
paraphernalia common to all Restaurants where little expense has 
been spared to give the impression that no expense has been spared. 
Arthur glanced around, half expecting to see someone making an 
American Express commercial. 

Zaphod lurched into Ford, who lurched back into Zaphod. 

"Wowee," said Zaphod. 

"Zappo," said Ford. 

"My great granddaddy must have really screwed up the computer's 
works, you know," said Zaphod, "I told it to take us to the nearest 
place to eat and it sends us to the End of the Universe. Remind me to 
be nice to it one day." 

Fie paused. 

"Fley, everybody's here you know. Everybody who was anybody." 

"Was?" said Arthur. 

"At the End of the Universe you have to use the past tense a lot," 
said Zaphod, "'cos everything's been done you know. FHi, guys," he 
called out to a nearby party of giant iguana lifeforms, "Flow did you 
do?" 

"Is that Zaphod Beeblebrox?" asked one iguana of another iguana. 

"I think so," replied the second iguana. 

"Well doesn't that just take the biscuit," said the first iguana. 

"Funny old thing, life," said the second iguana. 

"It's what you make of it," said the first and they lapsed back into 
silence. They were waiting for the greatest show in the Universe. 

"Fley, Zaphod," said Ford, grabbing for his arm and, on account of 
the third Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, missing. Fie pointed a swaying 
finger. 



"There's an old mate of mine," he said, "Hotblack Desiato! See the 
man at the platinum table with the platinum suit on?" 

Zaphod tried to follow Ford's finger with his eyes but it made him 
feel dizzy. Finally he saw. 

"Oh yeah," he said, then recognition came a moment later. "Fley," 
he said, "did that guy ever make it megabig! Wow, bigger than the 
biggest thing ever. Other than me." 

"Who's he supposed to be?" asked Trillian. 

"Hotblack Desiato?" said Zaphod in astonishment, "you don't know? 
You never heard of Disaster Area?" 

"No," said Trillian, who hadn't. 

"The biggest," said Ford, "loudest..." 

"Richest..." suggested Zaphod. 

"... rock band in the history of..." he searched for the word. 

"... history itself," said Zaphod. 

"No," said Trillian. 

"Zowee," said Zaphod, "here we are at the End of the Universe and 
you haven't even lived yet. Did you miss out." 

He led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time at 
the table. Arthur followed them feeling very lost and alone. 

Ford waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance. 

"Hey, er, Hotblack," he called out, "how you doing? Great to see 
you big boy, how's the noise? You're looking great, really very, very 
fat and unwell. Amazing." He slapped the man on the back and was 
mildly surprised that it seemed to elict no response. The Pan Galactic 
Gargle Blasters swirling round inside him told him to plunge on 
regardless. 

"Remember the old days?" he said, "We used to hang out, right? 

The Bistro Illegal, remember? Slim's Throat Emporium? The Evildrome 
Boozarama, great days eh?" 

Hotblack Desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great 
days or not. Ford was not perturbed. 

"And when we were hungry we'd pose as public health inspectors, 
you remember that? And go around confiscating meals and drinks 
right? Till we got food poisoning. Oh, and then there were the long 
nights of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above the Cafe 



Lou in Gretchen Town, New Betel, and you were always in the next 
room trying to write songs on your ajuitar and we all hated them. And 
you said you didn't care, and we said we did because we hated them 
so much." Ford's eyes were beginning to mist over. 

"And you said you didn't want to be a star," he continued, 
wallowing in nostalgia, "because you despised the star system. And 
we said, Hadra and Sulijoo and me, that we didn't think you had the 
option. And what do you do now? You buy star systems!" 

He turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables. 

"Here," he said, "is a man who buys star systems!" 

Hotblack Desiato made no attempt either to confirm or deny this 
fact, and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly. 

"I think someone's drunk," muttered a purple bush-like being into 
his wine glass. 

Ford staggered slightly, and sat down heavily on the chair facing 
Hotblack Desiato. 

"What's that number you do?" he said, unwisely grabbing at a 
bottle for support and tipping it over - into a nearby glass as it 
happened. Not to waste a happy accident, he drained the glass. 

"That really huge number," he continued, "how does it go? 'Bwarm 
Bwarm! Baderr!!' something, and in the stage act you do it ends up 
with this ship crashing right into the sun, and you actually do it!" 

Ford crashed his fist into his other hand to illustrate this feat 
graphically. He knocked the bottle over again. 

"Ship! Sun! Wham bang!" he cried. "I mean forget lasers and stuff, 
you guys are into solar flares and real sunburn! Oh, and terrible 
songs." 

His eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle on 
to the table. Something ought to be done about it, he thought. 

"Hey, you want a drink?" he said. It began to sink into his 
squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion, and 
that the missing something was in some way connected with the fact 
that the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit and the 
silvery trilby had not yet said "Hi, Ford" or "Great to see you after all 
this time," or in fact anything at all. More to the point he had not yet 
even moved. 


"Hotblack?" said Ford. 



A large meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and 
pushed him aside. He slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards 
to see if he could spot the owner of this discourteous hand. The 
owner was not hard to spot, on account of his being something of the 
order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with it. In fact he was 
built the way one builds leather sofas, shiny, lumpy and with lots of 
solid stuffing. The suit into which the man's body had been stuffed 
looked as if it's only purpose in life was to demonstrate how difficult it 
was to get this sort of body into a suit. The face had the texture of an 
orange and the colour of an apple, but there the resemblance to 
anything sweet ended. 

"Kid..." said a voice which emerged from the man's mouth as if it 
had been having a really rough time down in his chest. 

"Er, yeah?" said Ford conversationally. He staggered back to his 
feet again and was disappointed that the top of his head didn't come 
further up the man's body. 

"Beat it," said the man. 

"Oh yeah?" said Ford, wondering how wise he was being, "and who 
are you?" 

The man considered this for a moment. He wasn't used to being 
asked this sort of question. Nevertheless, after a while he came up 
with an answer. 

"I'm the guy who's telling you to beat it," he said, "before you get it 
beaten for you." 

"Now listen," said Ford nervously - he wished his head would stop 
spinning, settle down and get to grips with the situation - "Now 
listen," he continued, "I am one of Hotblack's oldest friends and..." 

He glanced at Hotblack Desiato, who still hadn't moved so much as 
an eyelash. 

"... and..." said Ford again, wondering what would be a good word 
to say after "and". 

The large man came up with a whole sentence to go after "and". 

He said it. 

"And I am Mr. Desiato's bodyguard," it went, "and I am responsible 
for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away 
before it gets damaged." 


"Now wait a minute," said Ford. 



"No minutes!" boomed the bodyguard, "no waiting! Mr. Desiato 
speaks to no one!" 

"Well perhaps you'd let him say what he thinks about the matter 
himself," said Ford. 

"He speaks to no one!" bellowed the bodyguard. 

Ford glanced anxiously at Hotblack again and was forced to admit 
to himself that the bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his side. 
There was still not the slightest sign of movement, let alone keen 
interest in Ford's welfare. 

"Why?" said Ford, "What's the matter with him?" 

The bodyguard told him. 



Chapter 17 


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a 
plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally 
held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but in fact the 
loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers judge that the 
best sound balance is usually to be heard from within large concrete 
bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the stage, whilst the musicians 
themselves play their instruments by remote control from within a 
heavily insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the planet - or 
more frequently around a completely different planet. 

Their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the 
familiar theme of boy-being meets girl-being beneath a silvery moon, 
which then explodes for no adequately explored reason. 

Many worlds have now banned their act altogether, sometimes for 
artistic reasons, but most commonly because the band's public 
address system contravenes local strategic arms limitations treaties. 

This has not, however, stopped their earnings from pushing back 
the boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research 
accountant has recently been appointed Professor of 
Neomathematics at the University of Maximegalon, in recognition of 
both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax Returns, 
in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space-time continuum 
is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent. 

Ford staggered back to the table where Zaphod, Arthur and Trillian 
were sitting waiting for the fun to begin. 

"Gotta have some food," said Ford. 

"Hi, Ford," said Zaphod, "you speak to the big noise boy?" 

Ford waggled his head noncommittally. 

"Hotblack? I sort of spoke to him, yeah." 

"What'd he say?" 



"Well, not a lot really. He's... er..." 

"Yeah?" 

"He's spending a year dead for tax reasons. I've got to sit down." 

He sat down. 

The waiter approached. 

"Would you like to see the menu?" he said, "or would you like to 
meet the Dish of the Day?" 

"Huh?" said Ford. 

"Huh?" said Arthur. 

"Huh?" said Trillian. 

"That's cool," said Zaphod, "we'll meet the meat." 

In a small room in one of the arms of the Restaurant complex a tall, 
thin, gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion looked him in 
the face. 

It was not a pretty face, perhaps because oblivion had looked him 
in it so many times. It was too long for a start, the eyes too sunken 
and too hooded, the cheeks too hollow, his lips were too thin and too 
long, and when they parted his teeth looked too much like a recently 
polished bay window. The hands that held the curtain were long and 
thin too: they were also cold. They lay lightly along the folds of the 
curtain and gave the impression that if he didn't watch them like a 
hawk they would crawl away of their own accord and do something 
unspeakable in a corner. 

He let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on his 
features went off to play somewhere more healthy. He prowled 
around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evening's 
preying, finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table, where he 
leafed through a few sheets of jokes. 

A bell rang. 

He pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up. His hands 
brushed limply over some of the one million rainbow-coloured 
sequins with which his jacket was festooned, and he was gone 
through the door. 



In the Restaurant the lights dimmed, the band quickened its pace, a 
single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway that 
led up to the centre of the stage. 

Up the stairs bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure. He burst on 
to the stage, tripped lightly up to the microphone, removed it from its 
stand with one swoop of his long thin hand and stood for a moment 
bowing left and right to the audience acknowledging their applause 
and displaying to them his bay window. He waved to his particular 
friends in the audience even though there weren't any there, and 
waited for the applause to die down. 

He held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not merely 
from ear to ear, but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere 
confines of his face. 

"Thank you ladies and gentlemen!" he cried, "thank you very much. 
Thank you so much." 

He eyed them with a twinkling eye. 

"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "The Universe as we know it has 
now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand 
million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an hour. So, 
welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the 
Universe!" 

With a gesture he deftly conjured another round of spontaneous 
applause. With another gesture he cut it. 

"I am your host for tonight," he said, "my name is Max 
Quordlepleen..." (Everybody knew this, his act was famous 
throughout the known Galaxy, but he said it for the fresh applause it 
generated, which he acknowledged with a disclaiming smile and 
wave.)"... and I've just come straight from the very very other end of 
time, where I've been hosting a show at the Big Bang Burger Bar - 
where I can tell you we had a very exciting evening ladies and 
gentlemen - and I will be with you right through this historic occasion, 
the End of History itself!" 

Another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights dimmed 
down further. On every table candles ignited themselves 
spontaneously, eliciting a slight gasp from all the diners and 
wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million 
intimate shadows. A tremor of excitement thrilled through the 



darkened Restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very 
very slowly to dim, to darken, to fade. 

Max's voice was hushed as he continued. 

"So, ladies and gentlemen," he breathed, "the candles are lit, the 
band plays softly, and as the force-shielded dome above us fades into 
transparency, revealing a dark and sullen sky hung heavy with the 
ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see we're all in for a fabulous 
evening's apocalypse!" 

Even the soft tootling of the band faded away as stunned shock 
descended on all those who had not seen this sight before. 

A monstrous, grisly light poured in on them, 

- a hideous light, 

-a boiling, pestilential light, 

- a light that would have disfigured hell. 

The Universe was coming to an end. 

For a few interminable seconds the Restaurant span silently 
through the raging void. Then Max spoke again. 

"For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the end of the 
tunnel," he said, "this is it." 

The band struck up again. 

"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen," cried Max, "I'll be back with 
you again in just a moment, and meanwhile I leave you in the very 
capable hands of Mr. Reg Nullify and his cataclysmic Combo. Big hand 
please ladies and gentlemen for Reg and the boys!" 

The baleful turmoil of the skies continued. 

Hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a moment or so 
normal conversation resumed. Max began his round of the tables, 
swapping jokes, shouting with laughter, earning his living. 

A large dairy animal approached Zaphod Beeblebrox's table, a large 
fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes, small 
horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its 
lips. 

"Good evening," it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, "I 
am the main Dish of the Day. May I interest you in parts of my body?" 
It harrumphed and gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind quarters into a 
more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at them. 



Its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from Arthur 
and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger 
from Zaphod Beeblebrox. 

"Something off the shoulder perhaps?" suggested the animal, 
"Braised in a white wine sauce?" 

"Er, your shoulder?" said Arthur in a horrified whisper. 

"But naturally my shoulder, sir," mooed the animal contentedly, 
"nobody else's is mine to offer." 

Zaphod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the 
animal's shoulder appreciatively. 

"Or the rump is very good," murmured the animal. "I've been 
exercising it and eating plenty of grain, so there's a lot of good meat 
there." It gave a mellow grunt, gurgled again and started to chew the 
cud. It swallowed the cud again. 

"Or a casserole of me perhaps?" it added. 

"You mean this animal actually wants us to eat it?" whispered 
Trillian to Ford. 

"Me?" said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes, "I don't mean 
anything." 

"That's absolutely horrible," exclaimed Arthur, "the most revolting 
thing I've ever heard." 

"What's the problem Earthman?" said Zaphod, now transferring his 
attention to the animal's enormous rump. 

"I just don't want to eat an animal that's standing here inviting me 
to," said Arthur, "it's heartless." 

"Better than eating an animal that doesn't want to be eaten," said 
Zaphod. 

"That's not the point," Arthur protested. Then he thought about it 
for a moment. "Alright," he said, "maybe it is the point. I don't care, 
I'm not going to think about it now. I'll just... er..." 

The Universe raged about him in its death throes. 

"I think I'll just have a green salad," he muttered. 

"May I urge you to consider my liver?" asked the animal, "it must 
be very rich and tender by now, I've been force-feeding myself for 
months." 

"A green salad," said Arthur emphatically. 



"A green salad?" said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly at 
Arthur. 

"Are you going to tell me," said Arthur, "that I shouldn't have green 
salad?" 

"Well," said the animal, "I know many vegetables that are very 
clear on that point. Which is why it was eventually decided to cut 
through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that actually 
wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly. 
And here I am." 

It managed a very slight bow. 

"Glass of water please," said Arthur. 

"Look," said Zaphod, "we want to eat, we don't want to make a 
meal of the issues. Four rare steaks please, and hurry. We haven't 
eaten in five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years." 

The animal staggered to its feet. It gave a mellow gurgle. 

"A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good," it said, "I'll just 
nip off and shoot myself." 

He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur. 

"Don't worry, sir," he said, "I'll be very humane." 

It waddled unhurriedly off into the kitchen. 

A matter of minutes later the waiter arrived with four huge 
steaming steaks. Zaphod and Ford wolfed straight into them without 
a second's hesitation. Trillian paused, then shrugged and started into 
hers. 

Arthur stared at his feeling slightly ill. 

"Hey, Earthman," said Zaphod with a malicious grin on the face 
that wasn't stuffing itself, "what's eating you?" 

And the band played on. 

All around the Restaurant people and things relaxed and chatted. 
The air was filled with talk of this and that, and with the mingled 
scents of exotic plants, extravagant foods and insidious wines. For an 
infinite number of miles in every direction the universal cataclysm 
was gathering to a stupefying climax. Glancing at his watch. Max 
returned to the stage with a flourish. 

"And now, ladies and gentlemen," he beamed, "is everyone having 
one last wonderful time?" 



"Yes," called out the sort of people who call out "yes" when 
comedians ask them if they're having a wonderful time. 

"That's wonderful," enthused Max, "absolutely wonderful. And as 
the photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing to 
tear apart the last of the red hot suns, I know you're all going to settle 
back and enjoy with me what I know we will find all an immensely 
exciting and terminal experience." 

He paused. He caught the audience with a glittering eye. 

"Believe me, ladies and gentlemen," he said, "there's nothing 
penultimate about this one." 

He paused again. Tonight his timing was immaculate. Time after 
time he had done this show, night after night. Not that the word night 
had any meaning here at the extremity of time. All there was the 
endless repetition of the final moment, as the Restaurant rocked 
slowly forward over the brink of time's furthest edge - and back again. 
This "night" was good though, the audience was writhing in the palm 
of his sickly hand. His voice dropped. They had to strain to hear him. 

"This," he said, "really is the absolute end, the final chilling 
desolation, in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes 
extinct. This ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial 'it'." 

He dropped his voice still lower. In the stillness, a fly would not 
have dared clear its throat. 

"After this," he said, "there is nothing. Void. Emptiness. Oblivion. 
Absolute nothing..." 

His eyes glittered again - or did they twinkle?" 

"Nothing... except of course for the sweet trolley, and a fine 
selection of Aldebaran liqueurs!" 

The band gave him a musical sting. He wished they wouldn't, he 
didn't need it, not an artist of his calibre. He could play the audience 
like his own musical instrument. They were laughing with relief. He 
followed on. 

"And for once," he cried cheerily, "you don't need to worry about 
having a hangover in the morning - because there won't be any more 
mornings!" 

He beamed at his happy, laughing audience. He glanced up at the 
sky, going through the same dead routine every night, but his glance 



was only for a fraction of a second. He trusted it to do its job, as one 
professional trusts another. 

"And now," he said, strutting about the stage, "at the risk of 
putting a damper on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here 
this evening, I would like to welcome a few parties." 

He pulled a card from his pocket. 

"Do we have..." he put up a hand to hold back the cheers, "Do we 
have a party here from the Zansellquasure Flamarion Bridge Club 
from beyond the Vortvoid of Qvarne? Are they here?" 

A rousing cheer came from the back, but he pretended not to hear. 
He peered around trying to find them. 

"Are they here?" he asked again, to elict a louder cheer. 

He got it, as he always did. 

"Ah, there they are. Well, last bids lads - and no cheating, 
remember this is a very solemn moment." 

He lapped up the laughter. 

"And do we also have, do we have... a party of minor deities from 
the Halls of Asgard?" 

Away to his right came a rumble of thunder. Lightning arced across 
the stage. A small group of hairy men with helmets sat looking very 
pleased with themselves, and raised their glasses to him. 

Hasbeens, he thought to himself. 

"Careful with that hammer, sir," he said. 

They did their trick with the lightning again. Max gave them a very 
thin lipped smile. 

"And thirdly," he said, "thirdly a party of Young Conservatives from 
Sirius B, are they here?" 

A party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing rolls at 
each other and started throwing rolls at the stage. They yapped and 
barked unintelligibly. 

"Yes," said Max, "well this is all your fault, you realize that?" 

"And finally," said Max, quieting the audience down and putting on 
his solemn face, "finally I believe we have with us here tonight, a 
party of believers, very devout believers, from the Church of the 
Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon." 



There were about twenty of them, sitting right out on the edge of 
the floor, ascetically dressed, sipping mineral water nervously, and 
staying apart from the festivities. They blinked resentfully as the 
spotlight was turned on them. 

"There they are," said Max, "sitting there, patiently. He said he'd 
come again, and he's kept you waiting a long time, so let's hope he's 
hurrying fellas, because he's only got eight minutes left!" 

The party of Zarquon's followers sat rigid, refusing to be buffeted 
by the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over them. 

Max restrained his audience. 

"No, but seriously though folks, seriously though, no offence meant. 
No, I know we shouldn't make fun of deeply held beliefs, so I think a 
big hand please for the Great Prophet Zarquon..." 

The audience clapped respectfully. 

"... wherever he's got to!" 

He blew a kiss to the stony-faced party and returned to the centre 
of the stage. 

He grabbed a tall stool and sat on it. 

"It's marvellous though," he rattled on, "to see so many of you here 
tonight - no isn't it though? Yes, absolutely marvellous. Because I 
know that so many of you come here time and time again, which I 
think is really wonderful, to come and watch this final end of 
everything, and then return home to your own eras... and raise 
families, strive for new and better societies, fight terrible wars for 
what you know to be right... it really gives one hope for the future of 
all lifekind. Except of course," he waved at the blitzing turmoil above 
and around them, "that we know it hasn't got one..." 

Arthur turned to Ford - he hadn't quite got this place worked out 
in his mind. 

"Look, surely," he said, "if the Universe is about to end... don't we 
go with it?" 

Ford gave him a three-Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blaster look, in other 
words a rather unsteady one. 

"No," he said, "look," he said, "as soon as you come into this dive 
you get held in this sort of amazing force-shielded temporal warp 
thing. I think." 



"Oh," said Arthur. He turned his attention back to a bowl of soup 
he'd managed to get from the waiter to replace his steak. 

"Look," said Ford, "HI show you." 

He grabbed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly with it. 

"Look," he said again, "imagine this napkin, right, as the temporal 
Universe, right? And this spoon as a transductional mode in the 
matter curve..." 

It took him a while to say this last part, and Arthur hated to 
interrupt him. 

"That's the spoon I was eating with," he said. 

"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this spoon..." he found a small 
wooden spoon on a tray of relishes, "this spoon..." but found it rather 
tricky to pick up, "no, better still this fork..." 

"Hey would you let go of my fork?" snapped Zaphod. 

"Alright," said Ford, "alright, alright. Why don't we say... why don't 
we say that this wine glass is the temporal Universe..." 

"What, the one you've just knocked on the floor?" 

"Did I do that?" 

"Yes." 

"Alright," said Ford, "forget that. I mean... I mean, look, do you 
know - do you know how the Universe actually began for a kick off?" 

"Probably not," said Arthur, who wished he'd never embarked on 
any of this. 

"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this. Right. You get this bath. Right. A 
large round bath. And it's made of ebony." 

"Where from?" said Arthur, "Harrods was destroyed by the 
Vogons." 

"Doesn't matter." 

"So you keep saying." 

"Listen." 

"Alright." 

"You get this bath, see? Imagine you've got this bath. And it's 
ebony. And it's conical." 

"Conical?" said Arthur, "What sort of..." 



"Shhh!" said Ford. "It's conical. So what you do is, you see, you fill it 
with fine white sand, alright? Or sugar. Fine white sand, and/or sugar. 
Anything. Doesn't matter. Sugar's fine. And when it's full, you pull the 
plug out... are you listening?" 

"I'm listening." 

"You pull the plug out, and it all just twirls away, twirls away you 
see, out of the plughole." 

"I see." 

"You don't see. You don't see at all. I haven't got to the clever bit 
yet. You want to hear the clever bit?" 

"Tell me the clever bit." 

"I'll tell you the clever bit." 

Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit 
was. 

"The clever bit," he said, "is this. You film it happening." 

"Clever." 

"That's not the clever bit. This is the clever bit, I remember now 
that this is the clever bit. The clever bit is that you then thread the 
film in the projector... backwards!" 

"Backwards?" 

"Yes. Threading it backwards is definitely the clever bit. So then, 
you just sit and watch it, and everything just appears to spiral 
upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath. See?" 

"And that's how the Universe began is it?" said Arthur. 

"No," said Ford, "but it's a marvellous way to relax." 

Fie reached for his wine glass. 

"Where's my wine glass?" he said. 

"It's on the floor." 

"Ah." 

Tipping back his chair to look for it. Ford collided with the small 
green waiter who was approaching the table carrying a portable 
telephone. 

Ford excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because 
he was extremely drunk. 



The waiter said that that was quite alright and that he perfectly 
understood. 

Ford thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence, attempted to tug 
his forelock, missed by six inches and slid under the table. 

"Mr. Zaphod Beeblebrox?" inquired the waiter. 

"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, glancing up from his third steak. 

"There is a phone call for you." 

"Hey, what?" 

"A phone call, sir." 

"For me? Here? Hey, but who knows where I am?" 

One of his minds raced. The other dawdled lovingly over the food it 
was still shovelling in. 

"Excuse me if I carry on, won't you?" said his eating head and 
carried on. 

There were now so many people after him he'd lost count. He 
shouldn't have made such a conspicuous entrance. Hell, why not 
though, he thought. How do you know you're having fun if there's no 
one watching you have it? 

"Maybe someone here tipped off the Galactic Police," said Trillian. 
"Everyone saw you come in." 

"You mean they want to arrest me over the phone?" said Zaphod, 
"Could be. I'm a pretty dangerous dude when I'm concerned." 

"Yeah," said a voice from under the table, "you go to pieces so fast 
people get hit by the shrapnel." 

"Hey, what is this, Judgment Day?" snapped Zaphod. 

"Do we get to see that as well?" asked Arthur nervously. 

"I'm in no hurry," muttered Zaphod, "OK, so who's the cat on the 
phone?" He kicked Ford. "Hey get up there, kid," he said to him, "I 
may need you." 

"I am not," said the waiter, "personally acquainted with the metal 
gentlemen in question, sir..." 

"Metal?" 

"Yes, sir." 


"Did you say metal?" 



"Yes, sir. I said that I am not personally acquainted with the metal 
gentleman in question..." 

"OK, carry on." 

"But I am informed that he has been awaiting your return for a 
considerable number of millennia. It seems you left here somewhat 
precipitately." 

"Left here?" said Zaphod, "are you being strange? We only just 
arrived here." 

"Indeed, sir," persisted the waiter doggedly, "but before you 
arrived here, sir, I understand that you left here." 

Zaphod tried this in one brain, then in the other. 

"You're saying," he said, "that before we arrived here, we left 
here?" 

This is going to be a long night, thought the waiter. 

"Precisely, sir," he said. 

"Put your analyst on danger money, baby," advised Zaphod. 

"No, wait a minute," said Ford, emerging above table level again, 
"where exactly is here?" 

"To be absolutely exact sir, it is Frogstar World B." 

"But we just left there," protested Zaphod, "we left there and came 
to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe." 

"Yes, sir," said the waiter, feeling that he was now into the home 
stretch and running well, "the one was constructed on the ruins of the 
other." 

"Oh," said Arthur brightly, "you mean we've travelled in time but 
not in space." 

"Listen you semi-evolved simian," cut in Zaphod, "go climb a tree 
will you?" 

Arthur bristled. 

"Go bang your heads together four-eyes," he advised Zaphod. 

"No, no," the waiter said to Zaphod, "your monkey has got it right, 
sir." 

Arthur stuttered in fury and said nothing apposite, or indeed 
coherent. 

"You jumped forward... I believe five hundred and seventy-six 
thousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place," 



explained the waiter. He smiled. He had a wonderful feeling that he 
had finally won through against what had seemed to be insuperable 
odds. 

"That's it!" said Zaphod, "I got it. I told the computer to send us to 
the nearest place to eat, that's exactly what it did. Give or take five 
hundred and seventy-six thousand million years, we never moved. 
Neat." 

They all agreed this was very neat. 

"But who," said Zaphod, "is the cat on the phone?" 

"Whatever happened to Marvin?" said Trillian. 

Zaphod clapped his hands to his heads. 

"The Paranoid Android! I left him moping about on Frogstar B." 

"When was this?" 

"Well, er, five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years ago I 
suppose," said Zaphod, "Hey, er, hand me the rap-rod, Plate Captain." 

The little waiter's eyebrows wandered about his forehead in 
confusion. 

"I beg your pardon, sir?" he said. 

"The phone, waiter," said Zaphod, grabbing it off him. "Shee, you 
guys are so unhip it's a wonder your bums don't fall off." 

"Indeed, sir." 

"Hey, Marvin, is that you?" said Zaphod into the phone, "How you 
doing, kid?" 

There was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line. 

"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said. 

Zaphod cupped his hands over the phone. 

"It's Marvin," he said. 

"Hey, Marvin," he said into the phone again, "we're having a great 
time. Food, wine, a little personal abuse and the Universe going foom. 
Where can we find you?" 

Again the pause. 

"You don't have to pretend to be interested in me you know," said 
Marvin at last, "I know perfectly well I'm only a menial robot." 

"OK, OK," said Zaphod, "but where are you?" 



"'Reverse primary thrust, Marvin,' that's what they say to me, 

'open airlock number three, Marvin. Marvin, can you pick up that 
piece of paper?' Can I pick up that piece of paper! Here I am, brain the 
size of a planet and they ask me to..." 

"Yeah, yeah," sympathized Zaphod hardly at all. 

"But I'm quite used to being humiliated," droned Marvin, "I can 
even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like. Would you 
like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water? I've got one 
ready. Wait a minute." 

"Er, hey, Marvin..." interrupted Zaphod, but it was too late. Sad 
little clunks and gurgles came up the line. 

"What's he saying?" asked Trillian. 

"Nothing," said Zaphod, "he just phoned up to wash his head at 
us." 

"There," said Marvin, coming back on the line and bubbling a bit, "I 
hope that gave satisfaction..." 

"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod, "now will you please tell us where you 
are?" 

"I'm in the car park," said Marvin. 

"The car park?" said Zaphod, "what are you doing there?" 

"Parking cars, what else does one do in a car park?" 

"OK, hang in there, we'll be right down." 

In one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw down the phone 
and wrote "Hotblack Desiato" on the bill. 

"Come on guys," he said, "Marvin's in the car park. Let's get on 
down." 

"What's he doing in the car park?" asked Arthur. 

"Parking cars, what else? Dum dum." 

"But what about the End of the Universe? We'll miss the big 
moment." 

"I've seen it. It's rubbish," said Zaphod, "nothing but a gnab gib." 

"A what?" 

"Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let's get zappy." 

Few of the other diners paid them any attention as they weaved 
their way through the Restaurant to the exit. Their eyes were riveted 
on the horror of the skies. 



"An interesting effect to watch for," Max was telling them, "is in 
the upper left-hand quadrant of the sky, where if you look very 
carefully you can see the star system Hastromil boiling away into the 
ultra-violet. Anyone here from Hastromil?" 

There were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere at 
the back. 

"Well," said Max beaming cheerfully at them, "it's too late to worry 
about whether you left the gas on now." 



Chapter 18 


The main reception foyer was almost empty but Ford nevertheless 
weaved his way through it. 

Zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred him into a 
cubicle standing to one side of the entrance hall. 

"What are you doing to him?" asked Arthur. 

"Sobering him up," said Zaphod and pushed a coin into a slot. 

Lights flashed, gases swirled. 

"Hi," said Ford stepping out a moment later, "where are we going?" 

"Down to the car park, come on." 

"What about the personnel Time Teleports?" said Ford, "Get us 
straight back to the Heart of Gold." 

"Yeah, but I've cooled on that ship. Zarniwoop can have it. I don't 
want to play his games. Let's see what we can find." 

A Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter 
took them down deep into the substrata beneath the Restaurant. 
They were glad to see it had been vandalized and didn't try to make 
them happy as well as take them down. 

At the bottom of the shaft the lift doors opened and a blast of cold 
stale air hit them. 

The first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long concrete wall 
with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for all of fifty 
major lifeforms. Nevertheless, like every car park in the Galaxy 
throughout the entire history of car parks, this car park smelt 
predominantly of impatience. 

They turned a corner and found themselves on a moving catwalk 
that traversed a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the dim 
distance. 

It was divided off into bays each of which contained a space ship 
belonging to one of the diners upstairs, some smallish and utilitarian 



mass production models, others vast shining limoships, the playthings 
of the very rich. 

Zaphod's eyes sparkled with something that may or may not have 
been avarice as he passed over them. In fact it's best to be clear on 
this point-avarice is definitely what it was. 

"There he is," said Trillian, "Marvin, down there." 

They looked where she was pointing. Dimly they could see a small 
metal figure listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner of a 
giant silver suncruiser. 

At short intervals along the moving catwalk, wide transparent 
tubes led down to floor level. Zaphod stepped off the catwalk into 
one and floated gently downwards. The others followed. Thinking 
back to this later, Arthur Dent thought it was the single most 
enjoyable experience of his travels in the Galaxy. 

"Hey, Marvin," said Zaphod striding over towards to him, "Hey, kid, 
are we pleased to see you." 

Marvin turned, and in so far as it is possible for a totally inert metal 
face to look reproachfully, this is what it did. 

"No you're not," he said, "no one ever is." 

"Suit yourself," said Zaphod and turned away to ogle the ships. 

Ford went with him. 

Only Trillian and Arthur actually went up to Marvin. 

"No, really we are," said Trillian and patted him in a way that he 
disliked intensely, "hanging around waiting for us all this time." 

"Five hundred and seventy-six thousand million, three thousand 
five hundred and seventy-nine years," said Marvin, "I counted them." 

"Well, here we are now," said Trillian, feeling - quite correctly in 
Marvin's view - that it was a slightly foolish thing to say. 

"The first ten million years were the worst," said Marvin, "and the 
second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third million 
years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of decline." 

He paused just long enough to make them feel they ought to say 
something, and then interrupted. 

"It's the people you meet in this job that really get you down," he 
said and paused again. 

Trillian cleared her throat. 



"Is that..." 


"The best conversation I had was over forty million years ago," 
continued Marvin. 

Again the pause. 

"Oh d..." 

"And that was with a coffee machine." 

He waited. 

"That’s a..." 

"You don't like talking to me do you?" said Marvin in a low desolate 
tone. 

Trillian talked to Arthur instead. 


Further down the chamber Ford Prefect had found something of 
which he very much liked the look, several such things in fact. 

"Zaphod," he said in a quiet voice, "just look at some of these little 
star trolleys..." 

Zaphod looked and liked. 

The craft they were looking at was in fact pretty small but 
extraordinary, and very much a rich kid's toy. It was not much to look 
at. It resembled nothing so much as a paper dart about twenty feet 
long made of thin but tough metal foil. At the rear end was a small 
horizontal two-man cockpit. It had a tiny charm-drive engine, which 
was not capable of moving it at any great speed. The thing it did have, 
however, was a heat-sink. 

The heat-sink had a mass of some two thousand billion tons and 
was contained within a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic 
field situated half-way along the length of the ship, and this heat-sink 
enabled the craft to be manoeuvred to within a few miles of a yellow 
sun, there to catch and ride the solar flares that burst out from its 
surface. 

Flare-riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in 
existence, and those who can dare and afford it are amongst the most 
lionized men in the Galaxy. It is also of course stupefyingly dangerous 
- those who don't die riding invariably die of sexual exhaustion at one 
of the Daedalus Club's Apres-Flare parties. 



Ford and Zaphod looked and passed on. 

"And this baby," said Ford, "the tangerine star buggy with the black 
sunbusters..." 

Again, the star buggy was a small ship - a totally misnamed one in 
fact, because the one thing it couldn't manage was interstellar 
distances. Basically it was a sporty planet hopper dolled up to 
something it wasn't. Nice lines though. They passed on. 

The next one was a big one and thirty yards long - a coach built 
limoship and obviously designed with one aim in mind, that of making 
the beholder sick with envy. The paintwork and accessory detail 
clearly said "Not only am I rich enough to afford this ship, I am also 
rich enough not to take it seriously." It was wonderfully hideous. 

"Just look at it," said Zaphod, "multi-cluster quark drive, perspulex 
running boards. Got to be a Lazlar Lyricon custom job." 

Fie examined every inch. 

"Yes," he said, "look, the infra-pink lizard emblem on the neutrino 
cowling. Lazlar's trade mark. The man has no shame." 

"I was passed by one of these mothers once, out by the Axel 
Nebula," said Ford, "I was going flat out and this thing just strolled 
past me, star drive hardly ticking over. Just incredible." 

Zaphod whistled appreciatively. 

"Ten seconds later", said Ford, "it smashed straight into the third 
moon of Jaglan Beta." 

"Yeah, right?" 

"Amazing looking ship though. Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, 
steers like a cow." 

Ford looked round the other side. 

"Fley, come and see," he called out, "there's a big mural painted on 
this side. A bursting sun - Disaster Area's trade mark. This must be 
Flotblack's ship. Lucky old bugger. They do this terrible song you know 
which ends with a stuntship crashing into the sun. Meant to be an 
amazing spectacle. Expensive in stunt ships though." 

Zaphod's attention however was elsewhere. FHis attention was 
riveted on the ship standing next to Flotblack Desiato's limo. FHis 
mouths hung open. 

"That," he said, "that... is really bad for the eyes..." 



Ford looked. He too stood astonished. 

It was a ship of classic, simple design, like a flattened salmon, 
twenty yards long, very clean, very sleek. There was just one 
remarkable thing about it. 

"It's so... black!" said Ford Prefect, "you can hardly make out its 
shape... light just seems to fall into it!" 

Zaphod said nothing. He had simply fallen in love. 

The blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost impossible to 
tell how close you were standing to it. 

"Your eyes just slide off it..." said Ford in wonder. It was an 
emotional moment. He bit his lip. 

Zaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a man possessed - or 
more accurately like a man who wanted to possess. His hand reached 
out to stroke it. His hand stopped. His hand reached out to stroke it 
again. His hand stopped again. 

"Come and feel the surface," he said in a hushed voice. 

Ford put his hand out to feel it. His hand stopped. 

"You... you can't..." he said. 

"See?" said Zaphod, "it's just totally frictionless. This must be one 
mother of a mover..." 

He turned to look at Ford seriously. At least, one of his heads did - 
the other stayed gazing in awe at the ship. 

"What do you reckon, Ford?" he said. 

"You mean... er..." Ford looked over his shoulder. "You mean stroll 
off with it? You think we should?" 

"No." 

"Nor do I." 

"But we're going to, aren't we?" 

"How can we not?" 

They gazed a little longer, till Zaphod suddenly pulled himself 
together. 

"We better shift soon," he said. "In a moment or so the Universe 
will have ended and all the Captain Creeps will be pouring down here 
to find their bourge-mobiles." 

"Zaphod," said Ford. 



"Yeah?" 

"How do we do it?" 

"Simple," said Zaphod. He turned. "Marvin!" he called. 

Slowly, laboriously, and with a million little clanking and creaking 
noises that he had learned to simulate, Marvin turned round to 
answer the summons. 

"Come on over here," said Zaphod, "We've got a job for you." 

Marvin trudged towards them. 

"I won't enjoy it," he said. 

"Yes you will," enthused Zaphod, "there's a whole new life 
stretching out ahead of you." 

"Oh, not another one," groaned Marvin. 

"Will you shut up and listen!" hissed Zaphod, "this time there's 
going to be excitement and adventure and really wild things." 

"Sounds awful," Marvin said. 

"Marvin! All I'm trying to ask you..." 

"I suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you?" 

"What? Er... yes. Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod jumpily. He was 
keeping at least three eyes on the entrance. Time was short. 

"Well I wish you'd just tell me rather than try to engage my 
enthusiasm," said Marvin, "because I haven't got one." 

He walked on up to the ship, touched it, and a hatchway swung 
open. 

Ford and Zaphod stared at the opening. 

"Don't mention it," said Marvin, "Oh, you didn't." He trudged away 
again. 

Arthur and Trillian clustered round. 

"What's happening?" asked Arthur. 

"Look at this," said Ford, "look at the interior of this ship." 

"Weirder and weirder," breathed Zaphod. 

"It's black," said Ford, "Everything in it is just totally black..." 


In the Restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment after 
which there wouldn't be any more moments. 



All eyes were fixed on the dome, other than those of Hotblack 
Desiato's bodyguard, which were looking intently at Hotblack Desiato, 
and those of Hotblack Desiato himself which the bodyguard had 
closed out of respect. 

The bodyguard leaned forward over the table. Had Hotblack 
Desiato been alive, he probably would have deemed this a good 
moment to lean back, or even go for a short walk. His bodyguard was 
not a man which improved with proximity. On account of his 
unfortunate condition, however, Hotblack Desiato remained totally 
inert. 

"Mr. Desiato, sir?" whispered the bodyguard. Whenever he spoke, 
it looked as if the muscles on either side of his mouth were 
clambering over each other to get out of the way. 

"Mr. Desiato? Can you hear me?" 

Hotblack Desiato, quit naturally, said nothing. 

"Hotblack?" hissed the bodyguard. 

Again, quite naturally, Hotblack Desiato did not reply. 
Supernaturally, however, he did. 

On the table in front of him a wine glass rattled, and a fork rose an 
inch or so and tapped against the glass. It settled on the table again. 

The bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt. 

"It's time we get going, Mr. Desiato," muttered the bodyguard, 
"don't want to get caught in the rush, not in your condition. You want 
to get to the next gig nice and relaxed. There was a really big 
audience for it. One of the best. Kakrafoon. Five-hundred seventy-six 
thousand and two million years ago. Had you will have been looking 
forward to it?" 

The fork rose again, waggled in a non-committal sort of way and 
dropped again. 

"Ah, come on," said the bodyguard, "it's going to have been great. 
You knocked 'em cold." The bodyguard would have given Dr. Dan 
Streetmentioner an apoplectic attack. 

"The black ship going into the sun always gets 'em, and the new 
one's a beauty. Be real sorry to see it go. If we get on down there, I'll 
set the black ship autopilot and we'll cruise off in the limo. OK?" 

The fork tapped once in agreement, and the glass of wine 
mysteriously emptied itself. 



The bodyguard wheeled Hotblack Desiato's chair out of the 
Restaurant. 

"And now," cried Max from the centre of the stage, "the moment 
you've all been waiting for!" He flung his arms into the air. Behind him, 
the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling synthochords. 
Max had argued with them about this but they had claimed it was in 
their contract that that's what they would do. His agent would have 
to sort it out. 

"The skies begin to boil!" he cried. "Nature collapses into the 
screaming void! In twenty seconds' time, the Universe itself will be at 
an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!" 

The hideous fury of destruction blazed about them - and at that 
moment a still small trumpet sounded as from an infinite distance. 
Max's eyes swivelled round to glare at the band. None of them 
seemed to be playing a trumpet. Suddenly a wisp of smoke was 
swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him. The trumpet was 
joined by more trumpets. Over five hundred times Max had done this 
show, and nothing like this had ever happened before. He drew back 
in alarm from the swirling smoke, and as he did so, a figure slowly 
materialized inside, the figure of an ancient man, bearded, robed and 
wreathed in light. In his eyes were stars and on his brow a golden 
crown. 

"What's this?" whispered Max, wild-eyed, "what's happening?" 

At the back of the Restaurant the stony-faced party from the 
Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt 
ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying. 

Max blinked in amazement. He threw up his arms to the audience. 

"A big hand please, ladies and gentlemen," he hollered, "for the 
Great Prophet Zarquon! He has come! Zarquon has come again!" 

Thunderous applause broke out as Max strode across the stage and 
handed his microphone to the Prophet. 

Zarquon coughed. He peered round at the assembled gathering. 

The stars in his eyes blinked uneasily. He handled the microphone 
with confusion. 

"Er..." he said, "hello. Er, look, I'm sorry I'm a bit late. I've had the 
most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up at the last moment." 



He seemed nervous of the expectant awed hush. He cleared his 
throat. 

"Er, how are we for time?" he said, "have I just got a min - " 
And so the Universe ended. 



Chapter 19 


One of the major selling point of that wholly remarkable travel 
book, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, apart from its relative 
cheapness and the fact that it has the words DON'T PANIC written in 
large friendly letters on its cover, is its compendious and occasionally 
accurate glossary. The statistics relating to the geo-social nature of 
the Universe, for instance, are deftly set out between pages nine 
hundred and thirty-eight thousand and twenty-four and nine hundred 
and thirty-eight thousand and twenty-six; and the simplistic style in 
which they are written is partly explained by the fact that the editors, 
having to meet a publishing deadline, copied the information off the 
back of a packet of breakfast cereal, hastily embroidering it with a few 
footnoted in order to avoid prosecution under the incomprehensibly 
tortuous Galactic Copyright laws. 

It is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the book 
backwards in time through a temporal warp, and then successfully 
sued the breakfast cereal company for infringement of the same laws. 

Here is a sample: 

The Universe - some information to help you live in it. 

l~Area: Infinite. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy offers this definition of the 
word "Infinite". 

Infinite: Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some. Much 
bigger than that in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally stunning 
size, "wow, that's big", time. Infinity is just so big that by comparison, 
bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic multiplied by colossal 
multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort of concept we're trying to 
get across here. 



2~lmports: None. 


It is impossible to import things into an infinite area, there being no 
outside to import things in from. 

3~Exports: None. 

See imports. 

4~Population: None. 


It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply 
because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. 
However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must 
be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by 
infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average 
population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. 
From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also 
zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely 
the products of a deranged imagination. 

5~Monetary Units: None. 


In fact there are three freely convertible currencies in the Galaxy, 
but none of them count. The Altairan Dollar has recently collapsed, 
the Flaninian Pobble Bead is only exchangeable for other Flaninian 
Pobble Beads, and the Triganic Pu has its own very special problems. 
Its exchange rate of eight Ningis to one Pu is simple enough, but since 
a Ningi is a triangular rubber coin six thousand eight hundred miles 
across each side, no one has ever collected enough to own one Pu. 
Ningis are not negotiable currency because the Galactibanks refuse to 
deal in fiddling small change. From this basic premise it is very simple 
to prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged 
imagination. 


6~Art: None. 



The function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there 
simply isn't a mirror big enough - see point one. 

7~Sex: None. 

Well, in fact there is an awful lot of this, largely because of the total 
lack of money, trade, banks, art, or anything else that might keep all 
the non-existent people of the Universe occupied. 

However, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now 
because it really is terribly complicated. For further information see 
Guide chapters seven, nine, ten, eleven, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, 
nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four inclusive, and in fact most of the 
rest of the Guide. 



Chapter 20 


The Restaurant continued existing, but everything else had stopped. 
Temporal relastatics held it and protected it in a nothingness that 
wasn't merely a vacuum, it was simply nothing - there was nothing in 
which a vacuum could be said to exist. 

The force-shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque, 
the party was over, the diners were leaving, Zarquon had vanished 
along with the rest of the Universe, the Time Turbines were preparing 
to pull the Restaurant back across the brink of time in readiness for 
the lunch sitting, and Max Quordlepleen was back in his small 
curtained dressing room trying to raise his agent on the tempophone. 

In the car park stood the black ship, closed and silent. 

In to the car park came the late Mr. Hotblack Desiato, propelled 
along the moving catwalk by his bodyguard. 

They descended one of the tubes. As they approached the limoship 
a hatchway swung down from its side, engaged the wheels of the 
wheelchair and drew it inside. The bodyguard followed, and having 
seen his boss safely connected up to his death-support system, 
moved up to the small cockpit. Here he operated the remote control 
system which activated the autopilot in the black ship lying next to 
the limo, thus causing great relief to Zaphod Beeblebrox who had 
been trying to start the thing for over ten minutes. 

The black ship glided smoothly forward out of its bay, turned, and 
moved down the central causeway swiftly and quietly. At the end it 
accelerated rapidly, flung itself into the temporal launch chamber and 
began the long journey back into the distant past. 

The Milliways Lunch Menu quotes, by permission, a passage from 
the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The passage is this: 

The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass 
through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, 



Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and 
Where phases. 

For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question "How 
can we eat?", the second by the question "Why do we eat?" and the 
third by the question, "Where shall we have lunch?" 

The Menu goes on to suggest that Milliways, the Restaurant at the 
End of the Universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated 
answer to that third question. 

What it doesn't go on to say is that though it will usually take a 
large civilization many thousands of years to pass through the How, 
Why and Where phases, small social groupings under stressful 
conditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity. 

"How are we doing?" said Arthur Dent. 

"Badly," said Ford Prefect. 

"Where are we going?" said Trillian. 

"I don't know," said Zaphod Beeblebrox. 

"Why not?" demanded Arthur Dent. 

"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect. 

"Basically, what you're trying to say," said Arthur Dent, ignoring 
this suggestion, "is that we're out of control." 

The ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as Ford and Zaphod 
tried to wrest control from the autopilot. The engined howled and 
whined like tired children in a supermarket. 

"It's the wild colour scheme that freaks me," said Zaphod whose 
love affair with this ship had lasted almost three minutes into the 
flight, "Every time you try to operate on of these weird black controls 
that are labelled in black on a black background, a little black light 
lights up black to let you know you've done it. What is this? Some kind 
of galactic hyperhearse?" 

The walls of the swaying cabin were also black, the ceiling was 
black, the seats - which were rudimentary since the only important 
trip this ship was designed for was supposed to be unmanned - were 
black, the control panel was black, the instruments were black, the 
little screws that held them in place were black, the thin tufted nylon 
floor covering was black, and when they had lifted up a corner of it 
they had discovered that the foam underlay also was black. 



"Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different 
wavelengths," offered Trillian. 

"Or didn't have much imagination," muttered Arthur. 

"Perhaps," said Marvin, "he was feeling very depressed." 

In fact, though they weren't to know it, the decor had been chosen 
in honour of its owner's sad, lamented, and tax-deductible condition. 

The ship gave a particularly sickening lurch. 

"Take it easy," pleaded Arthur, "you're making me space sick." 

"Time sick," said Ford, "we're plummeting backwards through 
time." 

"Thank you," said Arthur, "now I think I really am going to be ill." 

"Go ahead," said Zaphod, "we could do with a little colour about 
this place." 

"This is meant to be a polite after-dinner conversation is it?" 
snapped Arthur. 

Zaphod left the controls for Ford to figure out, and lurched over to 
Arthur. 

"Look, Earthman," he said angrily, "you've got a job to do, right? 
The Question to the Ultimate Answer, right?" 

"What, that thing?" said Arthur, "I thought we'd forgotten about 
that." 

"Not me, baby. Like the mice said, it's worth a lot of money in the 
right quarters. And it's all locked up in that head thing of yours." 

"Yes but..." 

"But nothing! Think about it. The Meaning of Life! We get our 
fingers on that we can hold every shrink in the Galaxy up to ransom, 
and that's worth a bundle. I owe mine a mint." 

Arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm. 

"Alright," he said, "but where do we start? How should I know? 
They say the Ultimate Answer or whatever is Forty-two, how am I 
supposed to know what the question is? It could be anything. I mean, 
what's six times seven?" 

Zaphod looked at him hard for a moment. Then his eyes blazed 
with excitement. 

"Forty-two!" he cried. 

Arthur wiped his palm across his forehead. 



"Yes," he said patiently," I know that." 

Zaphod's faces fell. 

"I'm just saying that the question could be anything at all," said 
Arthur, "and I don't see how I am meant to know." 

"Because," hissed Zaphod, "you were there when your planet did 
the big firework." 

"We have a thing on Earth..." began Arthur. 

"Had," corrected Zaphod. 

"... called tact. Oh never mind. Look, I just don't know." 

A low voice echoed dully round the cabin. 

"I know," said Marvin. 

Ford called out from the controls he was still fighting a losing battle 
with. 

"Stay out of this Marvin," he said, "this is organism talk." 

"It's printed in the Earthman's brainwave patterns," continued 
Marvin, "but I don't suppose you'll be very interested in knowing 
that." 

"You mean," said Arthur, "you mean you can see into my mind?" 

"Yes," said Marvin. 

Arthur stared in astonishment. 

"And...?" he said. 

"It amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small." 

"Ah," said Arthur, "abuse." 

"Yes," confirmed Marvin. 

"Ah, ignore him," said Zaphod, "he's only making it up." 

"Making it up?" said Marvin, swivelling his head in a parody of 
astonishment, "Why should I want to make anything up? Life's bad 
enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it." 

"Marvin," said Trillian in the gentle, kindly voice that only she was 
still capable of assuming in talking to this misbegotten creature, "if 
you knew all along, why then didn't you tell us?" 

Marvin's head swivelled back to her. 

"You didn't ask," he said simply. 

"Well, we're asking you now, metal man," said Ford, turning round 
to look at him. 



At that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying, 
the engine pitch settled down to a gentle hum. 

"Hey, Ford," said Zaphod, "that sounds good. Have you worked out 
the controls of this boat?" 

"No," said Ford, "I just stopped fiddling with them. I reckon we just 
go to wherever this ship is going and get off it fast." 

"Yeah, right," said Zaphod. 

"I could tell you weren't really interested," murmured Marvin to 
himself and slumped into a corner and switched himself off. 

"Trouble is," said Ford, "that the one instrument in this while ship 
that is giving any reading is worrying me. If it is what I think it is, and if 
it's saying what I think it's saying, then we've already gone too far 
back into the past. Maybe as much as two million years before our 
own time." 

Zaphod shrugged. 

"Time is bunk," he said. 

"I wonder who this ship belongs to anyway," said Arthur. 

"Me," said Zaphod. 

"No. Who it really belongs to." 

"Really me," insisted Zaphod, "look, property is theft, right? 
Therefore theft is property. Therefore this ship is mine, OK?" 

"Tell the ship that," said Arthur. 

Zaphod strode over to the console. 

"Ship," he said, banging on the panels, "this is your new owner 
speaking to..." 

He got no further. Several things happened at once. 

The ship dropped out of time travel mode and re-emerged into real 
space. 

All the controls on the console, which had been shut down for the 
time trip now lit up. 

A large vision screen above the console winked into life revealing a 
wide starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead of them. 

None of these things, however, were responsible for the fact that 
Zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the 
rear of the cabin, as were all the others. 



They were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of noise that 
thuddered out of the monitor speakers surrounding the vision screen. 



Chapter 21 


Down on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in the middle of the vast 
Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound system. 

That is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not the stage 
technicians. They had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area's giant 
control ship which hung in orbit some four hundred miles above the 
surface of the planet, and they were testing the sound system from 
there. Anyone within five miles of the speaker silos wouldn't have 
survived the tuning up. 

If Arthur Dent had been within five miles of the speaker silos then 
his expiring thought would have been that in both size and shape the 
sound rig closely resembled Manhattan. Risen out of the silos, the 
neutron phase speaker stacks towered monstrously against the sky, 
obscuring the banks of plutonium reactors and seismic amps behind 
them. 

Buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers lay 
the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship, the 
massive photon-ajuitar, the bass detonator and the Megabang drum 
complex. 

It was going to be a noisy show. 

Aboard the giant control ship, all was activity and bustle. Hotblack 
Desiato's limoship, a mere tadpole beside it, had arrived and docked, 
and the lamented gentleman was being transported down the high 
vaulted corridors to meet the medium who was going to interpret his 
psychic impulses on to the ajuitar keyboard. 

A doctor, a logician and a marine biologist had also just arrived, 
flown in at phenomenal expense from Maximegalon to try to reason 
with the lead singer who had locked himself in the bathroom with a 
bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till it could be proved 
conclusively to him that he wasn't a fish. The bass player was busy 
machine-gunning his bedroom and the drummer was nowhere on 
board. 



Frantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on a 
beach on Santraginus V over a hundred light years away where, he 
claimed, he had been happy over half an hour now and had found a 
small stone that would be his friend. 

The band's manager was profoundly relieved. It meant that for the 
seventeenth time on this tour the drums would be played by a robot 
and that therefore the timing of the cymbalistics would be right. 

The sub-ether was buzzing with the communications of the stage 
technicians testing the speaker channels, and this it was that was 
being relayed to the interior of the black ship. 

Its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the cabin, and 
listened to the voices on the monitor speakers. 

"OK, channel nine on power," said a voice, "testing channel 
fifteen..." 

Another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship. 

"Channel fifteen AOK," said another voice. 

A third voice cut in. 

"The black stunt ship is now in position," it said, "it's looking good. 
Gonna be a great sundive. Stage computer on line?" 

A computer voice answered. 

"On line," it said. 

"Take control of the black ship." 

"Black ship locked into trajectory programme, on standby." 

"Testing channel twenty." 

Zaphod leaped across the cabin and switched frequencies on the 
sub-ether receiver before the next mind-pulverizing noise hit them. 

He stood there quivering. 

"What," said Trillian in a small quiet voice, "does sundive mean?" 

"It means," said Marvin, "that the ship os going to dive into the sun. 
Sun... Dive. It's very simple to understand. What do you expect if you 
steal Hotblack Desiato's stunt ship?" 

"How do you know..." said Zaphod in a voice that would make a 
Vegan snow lizard feel chilly, "that this is Hotblack Desiato's 
stuntship?" 

"Simple," said Marvin, "I parked it for him." 

"The why... didn't... you... tell us!" 



"You said you wanted excitement and adventure and really wild 
things." 

"This is awful," said Arthur unnecessarily in the pause which 
followed. 

"That's what I said," confirmed Marvin. 

On a different frequency, the sub-ether receiver had picked up a 
public broadcast, which now echoed round the cabin. 

"... fine weather for the concert here this afternoon. I'm standing 
here in front of the stage," the reporter lied, "in the middle of the 
Rudlit Desert, and with the aid of hyperbinoptic glasses I can just 
about make out the huge audience cowering there on the horizon all 
around me. Behind me the speaker stacks rise like a sheer cliff face, 
and high above me the sun is shining away and doesn't know what's 
going to hit it. The environmentalist lobby do know what's going to hit 
it, and they claim that the concert will cause earthquakes, tidal waves, 
hurricanes, irreparable damage to the atmosphere, and all the usual 
things that environmentalists usually go on about. 

"But I've just had a report that a representative of Disaster Area 
met with the environmentalists at lunchtime, and had them all shot, 
so nothing now lies in the way of..." 

Zaphod switched it off. He turned to Ford. 

"You know what I'm thinking?" he said. 

"I think so," said Ford. 

"Tell me what you think I'm thinking." 

"I think you're thinking it's time we get off this ship." 

"I think you're right," said Zaphod. 

"I think you're right," said Ford. 

"How?" said Arthur. 

"Quiet," said Ford and Zaphod, "we're thinking." 

"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die." 

"I wish you'd stop saying that," said Ford. 

It is worth repeating at this point the theories that Ford had come 
up with, on his first encounter with human beings, to account for 
their peculiar habit of continually stating and restating the very very 
obvious, as it 'It's a nice day," or "You're very tall," or "So this is it, 
we're going to die." 



His first theory was that if human beings didn't keep exercising 
their lips, their mouths probably seized up. 

After a few months of observation he had come up with a second 
theory, which was this - "If human beings don't keep exercising their 
lips, their brains start working." 

In fact, this second theory is more literally true of the Belcebron 
people of Kakrafoon. 

The Belcebron people used to cause great resentment and 
insecurity amongst neighboring races by being one of the most 
enlightened, accomplished, and above all quiet civilizations in the 
Galaxy. 

As a punishment for this behaviour, which was held to be 
offensively self righteous and provocative, a Galactic Tribunal inflicted 
on them that most cruel of all social diseases, telepathy. 

Consequently, in order to prevent themselves broadcasting every 
slightest thought that crossed their minds to anyone within a five mile 
radius, they now have to talk very loudly and continuously about the 
weather, their little aches and pains, the match this afternoon and 
what a noisy place Kakrafoon had suddenly become. 

Another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play 
host to a Disaster Area concert. 

The timing of the concert was critical. 

The ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in order to 
hit the sun six minutes and thirty-seven seconds before the climax of 
the song to which it related, so that the light of the solar flares had 
time to travel out to Kakrafoon. 

The ship had already been diving for several minutes by the time 
that Ford Prefect had completed his search of the other 
compartments of the black ship. He burst back into the cabin. 

The sun of Kakrafoon loomed terrifyingly large on the vision screen, 
its blazing white inferno of fusing hydrogen nuclei growing moment 
by moment as the ship plunged onwards, unheeding the thumping 
and banging of Zaphod's hands on the control panel. Arthur and 
Trillian had the fixed expressions of rabbits on a night road who think 
that the best way of dealing with approaching headlights is to stare 
them out. 

Zaphod span round, wild-eyed. 



"Ford/ 1 he said, "how many escape capsules are there?" 

"None," said Ford. 

Zaphod gibbered. 

"Did you count them?" he yelled. 

"Twice," said Ford, "did you manage to raise the stage crew on the 
radio?" 

"Yeah," said Zaphod, bitterly, "I said there were a whole bunch of 
people on board, and they said to say 'hi' to everybody." 

Ford goggled. 

"Didn't you tell them who we were?" 

"Oh yeah. They said it was a great honour. That and something 
about a restaurant bill and my executors." 

Ford pushed Arthur aside and leaned forward over the control 
console. 

"Does none of this function?" he said savagely. 

"All overridden." 

"Smash the autopilot." 

"Find it first. Nothing connects." 

There was a moment's cold silence. 

Arthur was stumbling round the back of the cabin. Fie stopped 
suddenly. 

"Incidentally," he said, "what does teleport mean?" 

Another moment passed. 

Slowly, the others turned to face him. 

"Probably the wrong moment to ask," said Arthur, "It's just I 
remember hearing you use the word a short while ago and I only 
bring it up because..." 

"Where," said Ford Prefect quietly, "does it say teleport?" 

"Well, just over here in fact," said Arthur, pointing at a dark control 
box in the rear of the cabin, "Just under the word 'emergency', above 
the word 'system' and beside the sign saying 'out of order'." 

In the pandemonium that instantly followed, the only action to 
follow was that of Ford Prefect lunging across the cabin to the small 
black box that Arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly at the 
single small black button set into it. 



A six-foot square panel slid open beside it revealing a compartment 
which resembled a multiple shower unit that had found a new 
function in life as an electrician's junk store. Half-finished wiring hung 
from the ceiling, a jumble of abandoned components lay strewn on 
the floor, and the programming panel lolled out of the cavity in the 
wall into which it should have been secured. 

A junior Disaster Area accountant, visiting the shipyard where this 
ship was being constructed, had demanded to know of the works 
foreman why the hell they were fitting an extremely expensive 
teleport into a ship which only had one important journey to make, 
and that unmanned. The foreman had explained that the teleport was 
available at a ten percent discount and the accountant had explained 
that this was immaterial; the foreman had explained that it was the 
finest, most powerful and sophisticated teleport that money could 
buy and the accountant had explained that the money did not wish to 
buy it; the foreman had explained that people would still need to 
enter and leave the ship and the accountant had explained that the 
ship sported a perfectly serviceable door; the foreman had explained 
that the accountant could go and boil his head and the accountant 
had explained to the foreman that the thing approaching him rapidly 
from his left was a knuckle sandwich. After the explanations had been 
concluded, work was discontinued on the teleport which 
subsequently passed unnoticed on the invoice as "Sund. explns." at 
five times the price. 

"Hell's donkeys," muttered Zaphod as he and Ford attempted to 
sort through the tangle of wiring. 

After a moment or so Ford told him to stand back. He tossed a coin 
into the teleport and jiggled a switch on the lolling control panel. With 
a crackle and spit of light, the coin vanished. 

"That much of it works," said Ford, "however, there is no guidance 
system. A matter transference teleport without guidance 
programming could put you... well, anywhere." 

The sun of Kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen. 

"Who cares," said Zaphod, "we go where we go." 

"And," said Ford, "there is no autosystem. We couldn't all go. 
Someone would have to stay and operate it." 

A solemn moment shuffled past. The sun loomed larger and larger. 



"Hey, Marvin kid," said Zaphod brightly, "how you doing?" 

"Very badly I suspect," muttered Marvin. 

A shortish while later, the concert on Kakrafoon reached an 
unexpected climax. 

The black ship with its single morose occupant had plunged on 
schedule into the nuclear furnace of the sun. Massive solar flares 
licked out from it millions of miles into space, thrilling and in a few 
cases spilling the dozen or so Flare Riders who had been coasting 
close to the surface of the sun in anticipation of the moment. 

Moments before the flare light reached Kakrafoon the pounding 
desert cracked along a deep faultline. A huge and hitherto undetected 
underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed to the surface 
to be followed seconds later by the eruption of millions of tons of 
boiling lava that flowed hundreds of feet into the air, instantaneously 
vaporizing the river both above and below the surface in an explosion 
that echoed to the far side of the world and back again. 

Those-very few-who witnessed the event and survived swear that 
the whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose into the 
air like a mile-thick pancake, flipped itself over and fell back down. At 
that precise moment the solar radiation from the flares filtered 
through the clouds of vaporized water and struck the ground. 

A year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert was thick 
with flowers. The structure of the atmosphere around the planet was 
subtly altered. The sun blazed less harshly in the summer, the cold bit 
less bitterly in the winter, pleasant rain fell more often, and slowly the 
desert world of Kakrafoon became a paradise. Even the telepathic 
power with which the people of Kakrafoon had been cursed was 
permanently dispersed by the force of the explosion. 

A spokesman for Disaster Area - the one who had had all the 
environmentalists shot - was later quoted as saying that it had been 
"a good gig". 

Many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music. A few 
sceptical scientists examined the records of the events more closely, 
and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a vast 
artificially induced Improbability Field drifting in from a nearby region 
of space. 




Chapter 22 


Arthur woke up and instantly regretted it. Hangovers he'd had, but 
never anything on this scale. This was it, this was the big one, this was 
the ultimate pits. Matter transference beams, he decided, were not 
as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the head. 

Being for the moment unwilling to move on account of a dull 
stomping throb he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought. The 
trouble with most forms of transport, he thought, is basically one of 
them not being worth all the bother. On Earth - when there had been 
an Earth, before it was demolished to make way for a new hyperspace 
bypass - the problem had been with cars. The disadvantages involved 
in pulling lots of black sticky slime from out of the ground where it 
had been safely hidden out of harm's way, turning it into tar to cover 
the land with, smoke to fill the air with and pouring the rest into the 
sea, all seemed to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more 
quickly from one place to another - particularly when the place you 
arrived at had probably become, as a result of this, very similar to the 
place you had left, i.e. covered with tar, full of smoke and short offish 
And what about matter transference beams? Any form of transport 
which involved tearing you apart atom by atom, flinging those atoms 
through the sub-ether, and then jamming them back together again 
just when they were getting their first taste of freedom for years had 
to be bad news. 

Many people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent and had 
even gone to the lengths of writing songs about it. Here is one that 
used regularly to be chanted by huge crowds outside the Sirius 
Cybernetics Corporation Teleport Systems factory on Happi-Werld III: 

Aldebaran's great, OK, 

Algol's pretty neat, 

Betelgeuse's pretty girls, 

Will knock you off your feet. 



They'll do anything you like, 

Real fast and then real slow, 

But if you have to take me apart to get me there, 

Then I don't want to go. 

Singing, 

Take me apart, take me apart. 

What a way to roam. 

And if you have to take me apart to get me there, 

I'd rather stay at home. 

Sirius is paved with gold 
So I've heard it said 
By nuts who then go on to say 
"See Tau before you're dead." 

I'll gladly take the high road 
Or even take the low, 

But if you have to take me apart to get me there, 

Then I, for one, won't go. 

Singing, 

Take me apart, take me apart. You must be off your head, 
And if you try to take me apart to get me there, 

I'll stay right here in bed. 

... and so on. Another favorite song was much shorter: 

I teleported home one night. 

With Ron and Sid and Meg, 

Ron stole Meggie's heart away, 

And I got Sidney's leg. 

Arthur felt the waves of pain slowly receding, though he was 
aware of a dull stomping throb. Slowly, carefully, he stood up. 



"Can you hear a dull stomping throb?" said Ford Prefect. 

Arthur span round and wobbled uncertainly. Ford Prefect was 
approaching looking red eyed and pasty. 

"Where are we?" gasped Arthur. 

Ford looked around. They were standing in a long curving corridor 
which stretched out of sight in both directions. The outer steel wall - 
which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which they use in 
schools, hospitals and mental asylums to keep the inmates subdued - 
curved over the tops of their heads where it met the inner 
perpendicular wall which, oddly enough was covered in dark brown 
hessian wall weave. The floor was of dark green ribbed rubber. 

Ford moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the 
outer wall. It was several layers deep, yet through it he could see 
pinpoints of distant stars. 

"I think we're in a spaceship of some kind," he said. 

Down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb. 

"Trillian?" called Arthur nervously, "Zaphod?" 

Ford shrugged. 

"Nowhere about," he said, "I've looked. They could be anywhere. 
An unprogrammed teleport can throw you light years in any direction. 
Judging by the way I feel I should think we've travelled a very long 
way indeed." 

"Flow do you feel?" 

"Bad." 

"Do you think they're..." 

"Where they are, how they are, there's no way we can know and 
no way we can do anything about it. Do what I do." 

"What?" 

"Don't think about it." 

Arthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw the 
wisdom of it, tucked it up and put it away. Fie took a deep breath. 

"Footsteps!" exclaimed Ford suddenly. 

"Where?" 

"That noise. That stomping throb. Pounding feet. Listen!" 



Arthur listened. The noise echoed round the corridor at them from 
an indeterminate distance. It was the muffled sound of pounding 
footsteps, and it was noticeably louder. 

"Let's move," said Ford sharply. They both moved-in opposite 
directions. 

"Not that way," said Ford, "that's where they're coming from." 

"No it's not," said Arthur, "They're coming from that way." 

"They're not, they're..." 

They both stopped. They both turned. They both listened intently. 
They both agreed with each other. They both set off into opposite 
directions again. 

Fear gripped them. 

From both directions the noise was getting louder. 

A few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to the 
inner wall. They ran to it and hurried along it. It was dark, immensely 
long and, as they passed down it, gave them the impression that it 
was getting colder and colder. Other corridors gave off it to the left 
and right, each very dark and each subjecting them to sharp blasts of 
icy air as they passed. 

They stopped for a moment in alarm. The further down the 
corridor they went, the louder became the sound of pounding feet. 

They pressed themselves back against the cold wall and listened 
furiously. The cold, the dark and the drumming of disembodied feet 
was getting to them badly. Ford shivered, partly with the cold, but 
partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother used to tell 
him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian, ankle high to an 
Arcturan Megagrasshopper: stories of dead ships, haunted hulks that 
roamed restlessly round the obscurer regions of deep space infested 
with demons or the ghosts of forgotten crews; stories too of 
incautious travellers who found and entered such ships; stories of... - 
then Ford remembered the brown hessian wall weave in the first 
corridor and pulled himself together. Flowever ghosts and demons 
may choose to decorate their death hulks, he thought to himself, he 
would lay any money you liked it wasn't with hessian wall weave. Fie 
grasped Arthur by the arm. 

"Back the way we came," he said firmly and they started to retrace 
their steps. 



A moment later they leap like startled lizards down the nearest 
corridor junction as the owners of the drumming feet suddenly hove 
into view directly in front of them. 

Hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two 
dozen overweight men and women pounded past them in track suits 
panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart surgeon 
gibber. 

Ford Prefect stared after them. 

"Joggers!" he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed away up 
and down the network of corridors. 

"Joggers?" whispered Arthur Dent. 

"Joggers," said Ford Prefect with a shrug. 

The corridor they were concealed in was not like the others. It was 
very short, and ended at a large steel door. Ford examined it, 
discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide. 

The first thing that hit their eyes was what appeared to be a coffin. 

And the next four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine things 
that hit their eyes were also coffins. 



Chapter 23 


The vault was low ceilinged, dimly lit and gigantic. At the far end, 
about three hundred yards away an archway let through to what 
appeared to be a similar chamber, similarly occupied. 

Ford Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on to the 
floor of the vault. 

"Wild," he said. 

"What's so great about dead people?" asked Arthur, nervously 
stepping down after him. 

"Dunno," said Ford, "Let's find out shall we?" 

On closer inspection the coffins seemed to be more like sarcophagi. 
They stood about waist high and were constructed of what appeared 
to be white marble, which is almost certainly what it was - something 
that only appeared to be white marble. The tops were semi- 
translucent, and through them could dimly be perceived the features 
of their late and presumably lamented occupants. They were 
humanoid, and had clearly left the troubles of whatever world it was 
they came from far behind them, but beyond that little else could be 
discerned. 

Rolling slowly round the floor between the sarcophagi was a heavy, 
oily white gas which Arthur at first thought might be there to give the 
place a little atmosphere until he discovered that it also froze his 
ankles. The sarcophagi too were intensely cold to the touch. 

Ford suddenly crouched down beside one of them. Fie pulled a 
corner of his towel out of his satchel and started to rub furiously at 
something. 

"Look, there's a plaque on this one," he explained to Arthur, "It's 
frosted over." 

He rubbed the frost clear and examined the engraved characters. 
To Arthur they looked like the footprints of a spider that had had one 
too many of whatever it is that spiders have on a night out, but Ford 
instantly recognized an early form of Galactic Eezeereed. 



"It says 'Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven, Telephone 
Sanitizer Second Class' - and a serial number." 

"A telephone sanitizer?" said Arthur, "a dead telephone sanitizer?" 

"Best kind." 

"But what's he doing here?" 

Ford peered through the top at the figure within. 

"Not a lot," he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins of his 
which always made people think he'd been overdoing things recently 
and should try to get some rest. 

He scampered over to another sarcophagus. A moment's brisk 
towel work and he announced: 

"This one's a dead hairdresser. Hoopy!" 

The next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place of 
an advertising account executive; the one after that contained a 
second-hand car salesman, third class. 

An inspection hatch let into the floor suddenly caught Ford's 
attention, and he squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at the 
clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him. 

A thought occurred to Arthur. 

"If these are just coffins," he said, "Why are they kept so cold?" 

"Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway," said Ford tugging the 
hatchway open. The gas poured down through it. "Why in fact is 
anyone going to all the trouble and expense of carting five thousand 
dead bodies through space?" 

"Ten thousand," said Arthur, pointing at the archway through 
which the next chamber was dimly visible. 

Ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway. He looked 
up again. 

"Fifteen thousand," he said, "there's another lot down there." 

"Fifteen million," said a voice. 

"That's a lot," said Ford, "A lot a lot." 

"Turn around slowly," barked the voice, "and put your hands up. 
Any other move and I blast you into tiny tiny bits." 

"Hello?" said Ford, turning round slowly, putting his hands up and 
not making any other move. 

"Why," said Arthur Dent, "isn't anyone ever pleased to see us?" 



Standing silhouetted in the doorway through which they had 
entered the vault was the man who wasn't pleased to see them. His 
displeasure was communicated partly by the barking hectoring quality 
of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he waved a long 
silver Kill-O-Zap gun at them. The designer of the gun had clearly not 
been instructed to beat about the bush. "Make it evil," he'd been told. 
"Make it totally clear that this gun has a right end and a wrong end. 
Make it totally clear to anyone standing at the wrong end that things 
are going badly for them. If that means sticking all sort of spikes and 
prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it. This is not a gun for 
hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it is a gun 
for going out and making people miserable with." 

Ford and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily. 

The man with the gun moved from the door and circled round 
them. As he came into the light they could see his black and gold 
uniform on which the buttons were so highly polished that they shone 
with an intensity that would have made an approaching motorist flash 
his lights in annoyance. 

He gestured at the door. 

"Out," he said. People who can supply that amount of fire power 
don't need to supply verbs as well. Ford and Arthur went out, closely 
followed by the wrong end of the Kill-O-Zap gun and the buttons. 

Turning into the corridor they were jostled by twenty-four 
oncoming joggers, now showered and changed, who swept on past 
them into the vault. Arthur turned to watch them in confusion. 

"Move!" screamed their captor. 

Arthur moved. 

Ford shrugged and moved. 

In the vault the joggers went to twenty-four empty sarcophagi 
along the side wall, opened them, climbed in, and fell into twenty- 
four dreamless sleeps. 



Chapter 24 


"Er, captain..." 

"Yes, Number One?" 

"Just heard a sort of report thingy from Number Two." 

"Oh, dear." 

High up in the bridge of the ship, the Captain stared out into the 
infinite reaches of space with mild irritation. From where he reclined 
beneath a wide domed bubble he could see before and above them 
the vast panorama of stars through which they were moving - a 
panorama that had thinned out noticably during the course of the 
voyage. Turning and looking backwards, over the vast two-mile bulk 
of the ship he could see the far denser mass of stars behind them 
which seemed to form almost a solid band. This was the view through 
the Galactic centre from which they were travelling, and indeed had 
been travelling for years, at a speed that he couldn't quite remember 
at the moment, but he knew it was terribly fast. It was something 
approaching the speed of something or other, or was it three times 
the speed of something else? Jolly impressive anyway. He peered into 
the bright distance behind the ship, looking for something. He did this 
every few minutes or so, but never found what he was looking for. He 
didn't let it worry him though. The scientist chaps had been very 
insistent that everything was going to be perfectly alright providing 
nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their bit in an orderly 
fashion. 

He wasn't panicking. As far as he was concerned everything was 
going splendidly. He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy 
sponge. It crept back into his mind that he was feeling mildly irritated 
about something. Now what was all that about? A slight cough 
alerted him to the fact that the ship's first officer was still standing 
nearby. 

Nice chap, Number One. Not of the very brightest, had the odd 
spot of difficulty doing up his shoe laces, but jolly good officer 



material for all that. The Captain wasn't a man to kick a chap when he 
was bending over trying to do up his shoe laces, however long it took 
him. Not like that ghastly Number Two, strutting about all over the 
place, polishing his buttons, issuing reports every hour: "Ship's still 
moving, Captain." "Still on course, Captain." "Oxygen levels still being 
maintained, Captain." "Give it a miss," was the Captain's vote. Ah yes, 
that was the thing that had been irritating him. He peered down at 
Number One. 

"Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or other about having 
found some prisoners..." 

The Captain thought about this. Seemed pretty unlikely to him, but 
he wasn't one to stand in his officers' way. 

"Well, perhaps that'll keep him happy for a bit," he said, "He's 
always wanted some." 

Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent trudged onwards up the ship's 
apparently endless corridors. Number Two marched behind them 
barking the occasional order about not making any false moves or 
trying any funny stuff. They seemed to have passed at least a mile of 
continuous brown hessian wall weave. Finally they reached a large 
steel door which slid open when Number Two shouted at it. 

They entered. 

To the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most remarkable 
thing about the ship's bridge was not the fifty foot diameter 
hemispherical dome which covered it, and through which the dazzling 
display of stars shone down on them: to people who have eaten at 
the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, such wonders are 
commonplace. Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments that 
crowded the long circumferential wall around them. To Arthur this 
was exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to look like, 
and to Ford it looked thoroughly antiquated: it confirmed his 
suspicions that Disaster Area's stuntship had taken them back at least 
a million, if not two million, years before their own time. 

No, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath. 

The bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough hewn blue water 
crystal and was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the 
Maximegalon Museum of Diseased Imaginings. An intestinal jumble of 



plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than decently buried 
at midnight in an unmarked grave; the taps and shower attachment 
would have made a gargoyle jump. 

As the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was terribly 
wrong, and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this 
that Number Two approached it. 

"Captain, sir!" he shouted through clenched teeth - a difficult trick 
but he'd had years during which to perfect it. 

A large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up 
above the rim of the monstrous bath. 

"Ah, hello, Number Two," said the Captain, waving a cheery sponge, 
"having a nice day?" 

Number Two snapped even further to attention than he already 
was. 

"I have brought you the prisoners I located in freezer bay seven, 
sir!" he yapped. 

Ford and Arthur coughed in confusion. 

"Er... hello," they said. 

The Captain beamed at them. So Number Two had really found 
some prisoners. Well, good for him, thought the Captain, nice to see a 
chap doing what he's best at. 

"Oh, hello there," he said to them, "Excuse me not getting up, 
having a quick bath. Well, jynnan tonnyx all round then. Look in the 
fridge Number one." 

"Certainly sir." 

It is a curious fact, and one to which no one knows quite how much 
importance to attach, that something like 85% of all known worlds in 
the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have invented a 
drink called jynnan tonnyx, or gee-N'N-T'N-ix, or jinond-o-nicks, or any 
one of a thousand or more variations on the same phonetic theme. 

The drinks themselves are not the same, and vary between the 
Sivolvian "chinanto/mnigs" which is ordinary water server at slightly 
above room temperature, and the Gagrakackan "tzjin-anthony-ks" 
which kills cows at a hundred paces; and in fact the one common 
factor between all of them, beyond the fact that the names sound the 
same, is that they were all invented and named before the worlds 
concerned made contact with any other worlds. 



What can be made of this fact? It exists in total isolation. As far as 
any theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is right off the graph, 
and yet it persists. Old structural linguists get very angry when young 
structural linguists go on about it. Young structural linguists get 
deeply excited about it and stay up late at night convinced that they 
are very close to something of profound importance, and end up 
becoming old structural linguists before their time, getting very angry 
with the young ones. Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided and 
unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend too 
many nights drowning their problems in Ouisghian Zodahs. 

Number Two stood before the Captain's bathtub trembling with 
frustration. 

"Don't you want to interrogate the prisoners sir?" he squealed. 

The Captain peered at him in bemusement. 

"Why on Golgafrincham should I want to do that?" he asked. 

"To get information out of them, sir! To find out why they came 
here!" 

"Oh no, no, no," said the Captain, "I expect they just dropped in for 
a quick jynnan tonnyx, don't you?" 

"But sir, they're my prisoners! I must interrogate them!" 

The Captain looked at them doubtfully. 

"Oh all right," he said, "if you must. Ask them what they want to 
drink." 

A hard cold gleam came into Number Two's eyes. He advanced 
slowly on Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. 

"All right, you scum," he growled, "you vermin..." He jabbed Ford 
with the Kill-O-Zap gun. 

"Steady on. Number Two," admonished the Captain gently. 

"What do you want to drink?!!" NumberTwo screamed. 

"Well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me," said Ford, "What 
about you Arthur?" 

Arthur blinked. 

"What? Oh, er, yes," he said. 

"With ice or without?" bellowed NumberTwo. 

"Oh, with please," said Ford. 

"Lemon??!!" 



"Yes please," said Ford, "and do you have any of those little biscuits? 
You know, the cheesy ones?" 

"I'm asking the questions!!!!" howled Number Two, his body 
quaking with apoplectic fury. 

"Er, Number Two..." said the Captain softly. 

"Sir?!" 

"Push off, would you, there's a good chap. I'm trying to have a 
relaxing bath." 

Number Two's eyes narrowed and became what are known in the 
Shouting and Killing People trade as cold slits, the idea presumably 
being to give your opponent the impression that you have lost your 
glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake. Why this is frightening 
is an, as yet, unresolved problem. 

He advanced on the captain, his (Number Two's) mouth a thin hard 
line. Again, tricky to know why this is understood as fighting 
behaviour. If, whilst wandering through the jungle of Traal, you were 
suddenly to come upon the fabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast, you 
would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard line 
rather than, as it usually is, a gaping mass of slavering fangs. 

"May I remind you sir," hissed Number Two at the Captain, "that 
you have now been in that bath for over three years?!" This final shot 
delivered, Number Two spun on his heel and stalked off to a corner to 
practise darting eye movements in the mirror. 

The Captain squirmed in his bath. He gave Ford Prefect a lame 
smile. 

"Well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine," he said. 

Ford slowly lowered his hands. It provoked no reaction. Arthur 
lowered his. 

Treading very slowly and carefully, Ford moved over to the bath 
pedestal. He patted it. 

"Nice," he lied. 

He wondered if it was safe to grin. Very slowly and carefully, he 
grinned. It was safe. 

"Er..." he said to the Captain. 

"Yes?" said the Captain. 



"I wonder," said Ford, "could I ask you actually what your job is in 
fact?" 

A hand tapped him on the shoulder. He span round. 

It was the first officer. 

"Your drinks," he said. 

"Ah, thank you," said Ford. He and Arthur took their jynnan tonnyx. 
Arthur sipped his, and was surprised to discover it tasted very like a 
whisky and soda. 

"I mean, I couldn't help noticing," said Ford, also taking a sip, "the 
bodies. In the hold." 

"Bodies?" said the Captain in surprise. 

Ford paused and thought to himself. Never take anything for 
granted, he thought. Could it be that the Captain doesn't know he's 
got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship? 

The Captain was nodding cheerfully at him. He also appeared to be 
playing with a rubber duck. 

Ford looked around. Number Two was staring at him in the mirror, 
but only for an instant: his eyes were constantly on the move. The 
first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray and smiling 
benignly. 

"Bodies?" said the Captain again. 

Ford licked his lips. 

"Yes," he said, "All those dead telephone sanitizers and account 
executives, you know, down in the hold." 

The Captain stared at him. Suddenly he threw back his head and 
laughed. 

"Oh they're not dead," he said, "Good Lord no, no they're frozen. 
They're going to be revived." 

Ford did something he very rarely did. He blinked. 

Arthur seemed to come out of a trance. 

"You mean you've got a hold full of frozen hairdressers?" he said. 

"Oh yes," said the Captain, "Millions of them. Hairdressers, tired TV 
producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, 
public relations executives, management consultants, you name them. 
We're going to colonize another planet." 

Ford wobbled very slightly. 



"Exciting isn't it?" said the Captain. 

"What, with that lot?" said Arthur. 

"Ah, now don't misunderstand me," said the Captain, "we're just 
one of the ships in the Ark Fleet. We're the 'B' Ark you see. Sorry, 
could I just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me?" 

Arthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around 
the bath. The Captain let out a sigh of pleasure. 

"Thank you so much my dear fellow. Do help yourselves to more 
drinks of course." 

Ford tossed down his drink, took the bottle from the first officer's 
tray and refilled his glass to the top. 

"What," he said, "is a 'B'Ark?" 

"This is," said the Captain, and swished the foamy water around 
joyfully with the duck. 

"Yes," said Ford, "but..." 

"Well what happened you see was," said the Captain, "our planet, 
the world from which we have come, was, so to speak, doomed." 

"Doomed?" 

"Oh yes. So what everyone thought was, let's pack the whole 
population into some giant spaceships and go and settle on another 
planet." 

Flaving told this much of his story, he settled back with a satisfied 
grunt. 

"You mean a less doomed one?" promoted Arthur. 

"What did you say dear fellow?" 

"A less doomed planet. You were going to settle on." 

"Are going to settle on, yes. So it was decided to build three ships, 
you see, three Arks in Space, and... I'm not boring you am I?" 

"No, no," said Ford firmly, "it's fascinating." 

"You know it's delightful," reflected the Captain, "to have someone 
else to talk to for a change." 

Number Two's eyes darted feverishly about the room again and 
then settled back on the mirror, like a pair of flies briefly distracted 
from their favourite prey of months old meat. 

"Trouble with a long journey like this," continued the Captain, "is 
that you end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets terribly 



boring because half the time you know what you're going to say 
next." 

"Only half the time?" asked Arthur in surprise. 

The Captain thought for a moment. 

"Yes, about half I'd say. Anyway - where's the soap?" He fished 
around and found it. 

"Yes, so anyway," he resumed, "the idea was that into the first ship, 
the 'A' ship, would go all the brilliant leaders, the scientists, the great 
artists, you know, all the achievers; and into the third, or 'C' ship, 
would go all the people who did the actual work, who made things 
and did things, and then into the 'B' ship - that's us - would go 
everyone else, the middlemen you see." 

He smiled happily at them. 

"And we were sent off first," he concluded, and hummed a little 
bathing tune. 

The little bathing tune, which had been composed for him by one 
of his world's most exciting and prolific jingle writer (who was 
currently asleep in hold thirty-six some nine hundred yards behind 
them) covered what would otherwise have been an awkward 
moment of silence. Ford and Arthur shuffled their feet and furiously 
avoided each other's eyes. 

"Er..." said Arthur after a moment, "what exactly was it that was 
wrong with your planet then?" 

"Oh, it was doomed, as I said," said the Captain, "Apparently it was 
going to crash into the sun or something. Or maybe it was that the 
moon was going to crash into us. Something of the kind. Absolutely 
terrifying prospect whatever it was." 

"Oh," said the first officer suddenly, "I thought it was that the 
planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot 
piranha bees. Wasn't that it?" 

Number Two span around, eyes ablaze with a cold hard light that 
only comes with the amount of practise he was prepared to put in. 

"That's not what I was told!" he hissed, "My commanding officer 
told me that the entire planet was in imminent danger of being eaten 
by an enormous mutant star goat!" 

"Oh really..." said Ford Prefect. 



"Yes! A monstrous creature from the pit of hell with scything teeth 
ten thousand miles long, breath that would boil oceans, claws that 
could tear continents from their roots, a thousand eyes that burned 
like the sun, slavering jaws a million miles across, a monster such as 
you have never... never... ever..." 

"And they made sure they sent you lot off first did they?" inquired 
Arthur. 

"Oh yes," said the Captain, "well everyone said, very nicely I 
thought, that it was very important for morale to feel that they would 
be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a good haircut 
and where the phones were clean." 

"Oh yes," agreed Ford, "I can see that would be very important. 

And the other ships, er... they followed on after you did they?" 

For a moment the Captain did not answer. Fie twisted round in his 
bath and gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards the 
bright galactic centre. Fie squinted into the inconceivable distance. 

"Ah. Well it's funny you should say that," he said and allowed 
himself a slight frown at Ford Prefect, "because curiously enough we 
haven't heard a peep out of them since we left five years ago... but 
they must be behind us somewhere." 

Fie peered off into the distance again. 

Ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown. 

"Unless of course," he said softly, "they were eaten by the goat..." 

"Ah yes..." said the Captain with a slight hesitancy creeping into his 
voice, "the goat..." Flis eyes passed over the solid shapes of the 
instruments and computers that lined the bridge. They winked away 
innocently at him. Fie stared out at the stars, but none of them said a 
word. Fie glanced at his first and second officers, but they seemed lost 
in their own thoughts for a moment. Fie glanced at Ford Prefect who 
raised his eyebrows at him. 

"It's a funny thing you know," said the Captain at last, "but now 
that I actually come to tell the story to someone else... I mean does it 
strike you as odd Number Two?" 

"Errrrrrrrrrrr..." said Number Two. 

"Well," said Ford, "I can see that you've got a lot of things you're 
going to talk about, so, thanks for the drinks, and if you could sort of 
drop us off at the nearest convenient planet..." 



"Ah, well that's a little difficult you see," said the Captain, "because 
our trajectory thingy was preset before we left Golgafrincham, I think 
partly because I'm not very good with figures..." 

"You mean we're stuck here on this ship?" exclaimed Ford 
suddenly losing patience with the whole charade, "When are you 
meant to be reaching this planet you're meant to be colonizing?" 

"Oh, we're nearly there I think," said the Captain, "any second now. 
It's probably time I was getting out of this bath in fact. Oh, I don't 
know though, why stop just when I'm enjoying it?" 

"So we're actually going to land in a minute?" 

"Well not so much land, in fact, not actually land as such, no... er..." 

"What are you talking about?" said Ford sharply. 

"Well," said the Captain, picking his way through the words 
carefully, "I think as far as I can remember we were programmed to 
crash on it." 

"Crash?" shouted Ford and Arthur. 

"Er, yes," said the Captain, "yes, it's all part of the plan I think. 

There was a terribly good reason for it which I can't quite remember 
at the moment. It was something to with... er..." 

Ford exploded. 

"You're a load of useless bloody loonies!" he shouted. 

"Ah yes, that was it," beamed the Captain, "that was the reason." 



Chapter 25 


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say about the 
planet of Golgafrincham: It is a planet with an ancient and mysterious 
history, rich in legend, red, and occasionally green with the blood of 
those who sought in times gone by to conquer her; a land of parched 
and barren landscapes, of sweet and sultry air heady with the scent of 
the perfumed springs that trickle over its hot and dusty rocks and 
nourish the dark and musty lichens beneath; a land of fevered brows 
and intoxicated imaginings, particularly amongst those who taste the 
lichens; a land also of cool and shaded thoughts amongst those who 
have learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath; a 
land also of steel and blood and heroism; a land of the body and of 
the spirit. This was its history. 

And in all this ancient and mysterious history, the most mysterious 
figures of all were without doubt those of the Great Circling Poets of 
Arium. These Circling Poets used to live in remote mountain passes 
where they would lie in wait for small bands of unwary travellers, 
circle round them, and throw rocks at them. 

And when the travellers cried out, saying why didn't they go away 
and get on with writing some poems instead of pestering people with 
all this rock-throwing business, they would suddenly stop, and then 
break into one of the seven hundred and ninety-four great Song 
Cycles of Vassilian. These songs were all of extraordinary beauty, and 
even more extraordinary length, and all fell into exactly the same 
pattern. 

The first part of each song would tell how there once went forth 
from the City of Vassilian a party of five sage princes with four horses. 
The princes, who are of course brave, noble and wise, travel widely in 
distant lands, fought giant ogres, pursue exotic philosophies, take tea 
with weird gods and rescue beautiful monsters from ravening 
princesses before finally announcing that they have achieved 
enlightenment and that their wanderings are therefore accomplished. 



The second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of 
all their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk 
back. 

All this lay in the planet's remote past. It was, however, a 
descendant of one of these eccentric poets who invented the 
spurious tales of impending doom which enabled the people of 
Golgafrincham to rid themselves of an entire useless third of their 
population. The other two-thirds stayed firmly at home and lived full, 
rich and happy lives until they were all suddenly wiped out by a 
virulent disease contracted from a dirty telephone. 



Chapter 26 


That night the ship crash-landed on to an utterly insignificant little 
green-blue planet which circled a small unregarded yellow sun in the 
uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western spiral 
arm of the Galaxy. 

In the hours preceding the crash Ford Prefect had fought furiously 
but in vain to unlock the controls of the ship from their pre-ordained 
flight path. It had quickly become apparent to him that the ship had 
been programmed to convey its payload safely, in uncomfortably, to 
its new home but to cripple itself beyond repair in the process. 

Its screaming, blazing descent through the atmosphere had 
stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding, and its 
final inglorious bellyflop into a murky swamp had left its crew only a 
few hours of darkness during which to revive and offload its deep- 
frozen and unwanted cargo for the ship began to settle almost at 
once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the stagnant slime. Once or 
twice during the night it was starkly silhouetted against the sky as 
burning meteors - the detritus of its descent - flashed across the sky. 

In the grey pre-dawn light it let out an obscene roaring gurgle and 
sank for ever into the stinking depths. 

When the sun came up that morning it shed its thin watery light 
over a vast area heaving with wailing hairdressers, public relations 
executives, opinion pollsters and the rest, all clawing their way 
desperately to dry land. 

A less strong minded sun would probably have gone straight back 
down again, but it continued to climb its way through the sky and 
after a while the influence of its warming rays began to have some 
restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures. 

Countless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp in 
the night, and millions more had been sucked down with the ship, but 
those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands and as the 
day wore on they crawled out over the surrounding countryside, each 



looking for a few square feet of solid ground on which to collapse and 
recover from their nightmare ordeal. 

Two figures moved further afield. 

From a nearby hillside Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent watched the 
horror of which they could not feel a part. 

"Filthy dirty trick to pull," muttered Arthur. 

Ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged. 

"An imaginative solution to a problem I'd have thought," he said. 

"Why can't people just learn to live together in peace and 
harmony?" said Arthur. 

Ford gave a loud, very hollow laugh. 

"Forty-two!" he said with a malicious grin, "No, doesn't work. 

Never mind." 

Arthur looked at him as if he'd gone mad and, seeing nothing to 
indicate the contrary, realized that it would be perfectly reasonable to 
assume that this had in fact happened. 

"What do you think will happen to them all?" he said after a while. 

"In an infinite Universe anything can happen," said Ford, "Even 
survival. Strange but true." 

A curious look came into his eyes as they passed over the 
landscape and then settles again on the scene of misery below them. 

"I think they'll manage for a while," he said. 

Arthur looked up sharply. 

"Why do you say that?" he said. 

Ford shrugged. 

"Just a hunch," he said, and refused to be drawn to any further 
questions. 

"Look," he said suddenly. 

Arthur followed his pointing finger. Down amongst the sprawling 
masses a figure was moving - or perhaps lurching would be a more 
accurate description. Fie appeared to be carrying something on his 
shoulder. As he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he 
seemed to wave whatever the something was at them in a drunken 
fashion. After a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a heap. 

Arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him. 



"Movie camera," said Ford. "Recording the historic movement." 

"Well, I don't know about you," said Ford again after a moment, 
"but I'm off." 

Fie sat a while in silence. 

After a while this seemed to require comment. 

"Er, when you say you're off, what do you mean exactly?" said 
Arthur. 

"Good question," said Ford, "I'm getting total silence." 

Looking over his shoulder Arthur saw that he was twiddling with 
knobs on a small box. Ford had already introduced this box as a Sub- 
Etha Sens-O-Matic, but Arthur had merely nodded absently and not 
pursued the matter. In his mind the Universe still divided into two 
parts - the Earth, and everything else. The Earth having been 
demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass meant that 
this view of things was a little lopsided, but Arthur tended to cling to 
that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact with his home. 
Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matics belonged firmly in the "everything else" 
category. 

"Not a sausage," said Ford, shaking the thing. 

Sausage, thought Arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at the 
primitive world about him, what I wouldn't give for a good Earth 
sausage. 

"Would you believe," said Ford in exasperation, "that there are no 
transmissions of any kind within light years of this benighted tip? Are 
you listening to me?" 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"We're in trouble," said Ford. 

"Oh," said Arthur. This sounded like month-old news to him. 

"Until we pick up anything on this machine," said Ford, "our 
chances of getting off this planet are zero. It may be some freak 
standing wave effect in the planet's magnetic field - in which case we 
just travel round and round till we find a clear reception area. 
Coming?" 

He picked up his gear and strode off. 



Arthur looked down the hill. The man with the movie camera had 
struggled back up to his feet just in time to film one of his colleagues 
collapsing. 

Arthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after Ford. 



Chapter 27 


"I trust you had a pleasant meal?" said Zarniwoop to Zaphod and 
Trillian as they rematerialized on the bridge of the starship Heart of 
Gold and lay panting on the floor. 

Zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him. 

"You," he spat. He staggered to his feet and stomped off to find a 
chair to slump into. He found one and slumped into it. 

"I have programmed the computer with the Improbability 
Coordinates pertinent to our journey," said Zarniwoop, "we will arrive 
there very shortly. Meanwhile, why don't you relax and prepare 
yourself for the meeting?" 

Zaphod said nothing. He got up again and marched over to a small 
cabinet from which he pulled a bottle of old Janx spirit. He took a long 
pull at it. 

"And when this is all done," said Zaphod savagely, "it's done, alright? 
I'm free to go and do what the hell I like and lie on beaches and 
stuff?" 

"It depends what transpires from the meeting," said Zarniwoop. 

"Zaphod, who is this man?" said Trillian shakily, wobbling to her 
feet, "What's he doing here? Why's he on our ship?" 

"He's a very stupid man," said Zaphod, "who wants to meet the 
man who rules the Universe." 

"Ah," said Trillian taking the bottle from Zaphod and helping herself, 
"a social climber." 



Chapter 28 


The major problem - one of the major problems, for there are 
several - one of the many major problems with governing people is 
that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get 
people to let them do it to them. 

To summarize: it is a well known fact, that those people who most 
want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To 
summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting 
themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do 
the job. To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a 
problem. 

And so this is the situation we find: a succession of Galactic 
Presidents who so much enjoy the fun and palaver of being in power 
that they very rarely notice that they're not. 

And somewhere in the shadows behind them - who? 

Who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed 
to? 



Chapter 29 


On a small obscure world somewhere in the middle of nowhere in 
particular - nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it is 
protected by a vast field of unprobability to which only six men in this 
galaxy have a key - it was raining. 

It was bucketing down, and had been for hours. It beat the top of 
the sea into a mist, it pounded the trees, it churned and slopped a 
stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath. 

The rain pelted and danced on the corrugated iron roof of the small 
shack that stood in the middle of this patch of scrubby land. It 
obliterated the small rough pathway that led from the shack down to 
the seashore and smashed apart the neat piles of interesting shells 
which had been placed there. 

The noise of the rain on the roof of the shack was deafening within, 
but went largely unnoticed by its occupant, whose attention was 
otherwise engaged. 

He was a tall shambling man with rough straw-coloured hair that 
was damp from the leaking roof. His clothes were shabby, his back 
was hunched, and his eyes, though open, seemed closed. 

In his shack was an old beaten-up armchair, an old scratched table, 
an old mattress, some cushions and a stove that was small but warm. 

There was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten cat, and this was 
currently the focus of the man's attention. He bent his shambling 
form over it. 

"Pussy, pussy, pussy," he said, "coochicoochicoochicoo... pussy 
want his fish? Nice piece of fish... pussy want it?" 

The cat seemed undecided on the matter. It pawed rather 
condescendingly at the piece offish the man was holding out, and 
then got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor. 

"Pussy not eat his fish, pussy get thin and waste away, I think," said 
the man. Doubt crept into his voice. 

"I imagine this is what will happen," he said, "but how can I tell?" 



He proffered the fish again. 

"Pussy think," he said, "eat fish or not eat fish. I think it is better if I 
don't get involved." He sighed. 

"I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who am I to 
judge?" 

He left the fish on the floor for the cat, and retired to his seat. 

"Ah, I seem to see you eating it," he said at last, as the cat 
exhausted the entertainment possibilities of the speck of dust and 
pounced on to the fish. 

"I like it when I see you eat the fish," said the man, "because in my 
mind you will waste away if you don't." 

He picked up from the table a piece of paper and the stub of a 
pencil. He held one in one hand and the other in the other, and 
experimented with the different ways of bringing them together. He 
tried holding the pencil under the paper, then over the paper, then 
next to the paper. He tried wrapping the paper round the pencil, he 
tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the paper and then 
he tried rubbing the sharp end of the pencil against the paper. It 
made a mark, and he was delighted with the discovery, as he was 
every day. He picked up another piece of paper from the table. This 
had a crossword on it. He studied it briefly and filled in a couple of 
clues before losing interest. 

He tried sitting on one of his hands and was intrigued by the feel of 
the bones of his hip. 

"Fish come from far away," he said, "or so I'm told. Or so I imagine 
I'm told. When the men come, or when in my mind the men come in 
their six black ships, do they come in your mind too? What do you see 
pussy?" 

He looked at the cat, which was more concerned with getting the 
fish down as rapidly as possible than it was with these speculations. 

"And when I hear their questions, do you hear questions? What do 
their voices mean to you? Perhaps you just think they're singing songs 
to you." He reflected on this, and saw the flaw in the supposition. 

"Perhaps they are singing songs to you," he said, "and I just think 
they're asking me questions." 

He paused again. Sometimes he would pause for days, just to see 
what it was like. 



"Do you think they came today?" he said, "I do. There's mud on the 
floor, cigarettes and whisky on the table, fish on a plate for you and a 
memory of them in my mind. Hardly conclusive evidence I know, but 
then all evidence is circumstantial. And look what else they've left 
me." 

He reached over to the table and pulled some things off it. 

"Crosswords, dictionaries, and a calculator." 

He played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to 
sleep and the rain outside continued to pour. Eventually he put the 
calculator aside. 

"I think I must be right in thinking they ask me questions," he said, 
"To come all that way and leave all these things for the privilege of 
singing songs to you would be very strange behaviour. Or so it seems 
to me. Who can tell, who can tell." 

From the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with a spill from 
the stove. He inhaled deeply and sat back. 

"I think I saw another ship in the sky today," he said at last. "A big 
white one. I've never seen a big white one, just the six black ones. 

And the six green ones. And the others who say they come from so far 
away. Never a big white one. Perhaps six small black ones can look 
like one big white one at certain times. Perhaps I would like a glass of 
whisky. Yes, that seems more likely." 

He stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by the 
mattress. He poured in a measure from his whisky bottle. He sat again. 

"Perhaps some other people are coming to see me," he said. 

A hundred yards away, pelted by the torrential rain, lay the Heart 
of Gold. 

Its hatchway opened, and three figures emerged, huddling into 
themselves to keep the rain off their faces. 

"In there?" shouted Trillian above the noise of the rain. 

"Yes," said Zarniwoop. 

"That shack?" 

"Yes." 


"Weird," said Zaphod. 



"But it's in the middle of nowhere," said Trillian, "we must have 
come to the wrong place. You can't rule the Universe from a shack." 

They hurried through the pouring rain, and arrived, wet through, at 
the door. They knocked. They shivered. 

The door opened. 

"Hello?" said the man. 

"Ah, excuse me," said Zarniwoop, "I have reason to believe..." 

"Do you rule the Universe?" said Zaphod. 

The man smiled at him. 

"I try not to," he said, "Are you wet?" 

Zaphod looked at him in astonishment. 

"Wet?" he cried, "Doesn't it look as if we're wet?" 

"That's how it looks to me," said the man, "but how you feel about 
it might be an altogether different matter. If you feel warmth makes 
you dry, you'd better come in." 

They went in. 

They looked around the tiny shack, Zarniwoop with slight distaste, 
Trillian with interest, Zaphod with delight. 

"Hey, er..." said Zaphod, "what's your name?" 

The man looked at them doubtfully. 

"I don't know. Why, do you think I should have one? It seems very 
odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name." 

He invited Trillian to sit in the chair. He sat on the edge of the chair, 
Zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the table and Zaphod lay on the 
mattress. 

"Wowee!" said Zaphod, "the seat of power!" He tickled the cat. 

"Listen," said Zarniwoop, "I must ask you some questions." 

"Alright," said the man kindly, "you can sing to my cat if you like." 

"Would he like that?" asked Zaphod. 

"You'd better ask him," said the man. 

"Does he talk?" said Zaphod. 

"I have no memory of him talking," said the man, "but I am very 
unreliable." 

Zarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket. 

"Now," he said, "you do rule the Universe, do you?" 



"How can I tell?" said the man. 

Zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper. 

"How long have you been doing this?" 

"Ah," said the man, "this is a question about the past is it?" 

Zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement. This wasn't exactly what 
he had been expecting. 

"Yes," he said. 

"How can I tell," said the man, "that the past isn't a fiction designed 
to account for the discrepancy between my immediate physical 
sensations and my state of mind?" 

Zarniwoop stared at him. The steam began to rise from his sodden 
clothes. 

"So you answer all questions like this?" he said. 

The man answered quickly. 

"I say what it occurs to me to say when I think I hear people say 
things. More I cannot say." 

Zaphod laughed happily. 

"I'll drink to that," he said and pulled out the bottle of Janx spirit. 

He leaped up and handed the bottle to the ruler of the Universe, who 
took it with pleasure. 

"Good on you, great ruler," he said, "tell it like it is." 

"No, listen to me," said Zarniwoop, "people come to you do they? 

In ships..." 

"I think so," said the man. He handed the bottle to Trillian. 

"And they ask you," said Zarniwoop, "to take decisions for them? 
About people's lives, about worlds, about economies, about wars, 
about everything going on out there in the Universe?" 

"Out there?" said the man, "out where?" 

"Out there!" said Zarniwoop pointing at the door. 

"How can you tell there's anything out there," said the man politely, 
"the door's closed." 

The rain continued to pound the roof. Inside the shack it was warm. 

"But you know there's a whole Universe out there!" cried 
Zarniwoop. "You can't dodge your responsibilities by saying they don't 
exist!" 



The ruler of the Universe thought for a long while whilst Zarniwoop 
quivered with anger. 

"You're very sure of your facts," he said at last, "I couldn't trust the 
thinking of a man who takes the Universe - if there is one - for 
granted." 

Zarniwoop still quivered, but was silent. 

"I only decide about my Universe," continued the man quietly. "My 
Universe is my eyes and my ears. Anything else is hearsay." 

"But don't you believe in anything?" 

The man shrugged and picked up his cat. 

"I don't understand what you mean," he said. 

"You don't understand that what you decide in this shack of yours 
affects the lives and fates of millions of people? This is all monstrously 
wrong!" 

"I don't know. I've never met all these people you speak of. And 
neither, I suspect, have you. They only exist in words we hear. It is 
folly to say you know what is happening to other people. Only they 
know, if they exist. They have their own Universes of their own eyes 
and ears." 

Trillian said: 

"I think I'm just popping outside for a moment." 

She left and walked into the rain. 

"Do you believe other people exist?" insisted Zarniwoop. 

"I have no opinion. How can I say?" 

"I'd better see what's up with Trillian," said Zaphod and slipped out. 

Outside, he said to her: 

"I think the Universe is in pretty good hands, yeah?" 

"Very good," said Trillian. They walked off into the rain. 

Inside, Zarniwoop continued. 

"But don't you understand that people live or die on your word?" 

The ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could. When he 
heard the faint sound of the ship's engines starting he spoke to cover 
it. 

"It's nothing to do with me," he said, "I am not involved with 
people. The Lord knows I am not a cruel man." 



"Ah!" barked Zarniwoop, "you say 'The Lord'. You believe in 
something!" 

"My cat," said the man benignly, picking it up and stroking it, "I call 
him The Lord. I am kind to him." 

"Alright," said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point, "How do you 
know he exists? How do you know he knows you to be kind, or enjoys 
what he thinks of as your kindness?" 

"I don't," said the man with a smile, "I have no idea. It merely 
pleases me to behave in a certain way to what appears to be a cat. Do 
you behave any differently? Please, I think I am tired." 

Zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about. 

"Where are the other two?" he said suddenly. 

"What other two?" said the ruler of the Universe, settling back into 
his chair and refilling his whisky glass. 

"Beeblebrox and the girl! The two who were here!" 

"I remember no one. The past is a fiction to account for..." 

"Stuff it," snapped Zarniwoop and ran out into the rain. There was 
no ship. The rain continued to churn the mud. There was no sign to 
show where the ship had been. He hollered into the rain. He turned 
and ran back to the shack and found it locked. 

The ruler of the Universe dozed lightly in his chair. After a while he 
played with the pencil and the paper again and was delighted when 
he discovered how to make a mark with the one on the other. Various 
noises continued outside, but he didn't know whether they were real 
or not. He then talked to his table for a week to see how it would 
react. 



Chapter 30 


The stars came out that night, dazzling in their brilliance and clarity. 
Ford and Arthur had walked more miles than they had any means of 
judging and finally stopped to rest. The night was cool and balmy, the 
air pure, the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic totally silent. 

A wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical calm which 
combined with the soft fragrances of the woods, the quiet chatter of 
insects and the brilliant light of the stars to soothe their jangled spirits. 
Even Ford Prefect, who had seen more worlds than he could count on 
a long afternoon, was moved to wonder if this was the most beautiful 
he had ever seen. All that day they had passed through rolling green 
hills and valleys, richly covered with grasses, wild scented flowers and 
tall thickly leaved trees, the sun had warmed them, light breezes had 
kept them cool, and Ford Prefect had checked his Sub-Etha Sens-O- 
Matic at less and less frequent intervals, and had exhibited less and 
less annoyance at its continued silence. Fie was beginning to think he 
liked it here. 

Cool though the night air was they slept soundly and comfortably 
in the open and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall feeling 
refreshed but hungry. Ford had stuffed some small rolls into his 
satchel at Milliways and they breakfasted off those before moving on. 

So far they had wandered purely at random, but now they struck 
out firmly eastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore this 
world they should have some clear idea of where they had come from 
and where they were going. 

Shortly before noon they had their first indication that the world 
they had landed on was not an uninhabited one: a half glimpsed face 
amongst the trees, watching them. It vanished at the moment they 
both saw it, but the image they were both left with was of a 
humanoid creature, curious to see them but not alarmed. Flalf an 
hour later they glimpsed another such face, and ten minutes after 
that another. 



A minute later they stumbled into a wide clearing and stopped 
short. 

Before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of about 
two dozen men and women. They stood still and quiet facing Ford 
and Arthur. Around some of the women huddled some small children 
and behind the group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings made 
of mud and branches. 

Ford and Arthur held their breath. 

The tallest of the men stood a little over five feet high, they all 
stooped forward slightly, had longish arms and lowish foreheads, and 
clear bright eyes with which they stared intently at the strangers. 

Seeing that they carried no weapons and made no move towards 
them. Ford and Arthur relaxed slightly. 

For a while the two groups simply stared at each other, neither side 
making any move. The natives seemed puzzled by the intruders, and 
whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were quite clearly not 
issuing any invitations. 

For a full two minutes nothing continued to happen. 

After two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened. 

"Flello," he said. 

The women drew their children slightly closer to them. 

The men made hardly any discernible move and yet their whole 
disposition made it clear that the greeting was not welcome - it was 
not resented in any great degree, it was just not welcome. 

One of the men, who had been standing slightly forward of the rest 
of the group and who might therefore have been their leader, 
stepped forward. His face was quiet and calm, almost serene. 

"Ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh," he said quietly. 

This caught Arthur by surprise. Fie had grown so used to receiving 
an instantaneous and unconscious translation of everything he heard 
via the Babel Fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased to be aware of 
it, and he was only reminded of its presence now by the fact that it 
didn't seem to be working. Vague shadows of meaning had flickered 
at the back of his mind, but there was nothing he could get any firm 
grasp on. Fie guessed, correctly as it happens, that these people had 
as yet evolved no more than the barest rudiments of language, and 



that the Babel Fish was therefore powerless to help. He glanced at 
Ford, who was infinitely more experienced in these matters. 

"I think," said Ford out of the corner of his mouth, "he's asking us if 
we'd mind walking on round the edge of the village." 

A moment later, a gesture from the man-creature seemed to 
confirm this. 

"Ruurgggghhhh urrgggh; urgh urgh (uh ruh) rruurruuh ug," 
continued the man-creature. 

"The general gist," said Ford, "as far as I can make out, is that we 
are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if we 
would walk round his village rather than through it would make them 
all very happy." 

"So what do we do?" 

"I think we make them happy," said Ford. 

Slowly and watchfully they walked round the perimeter of the 
clearing. This seemed to go down very well with the natives who 
bowed to them very slightly and then went about their business. 

Ford and Arthur continued their journey through the wood. A few 
hundred yards past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small pile 
of fruit lying in their path - berries that looked remarkably like 
raspberries and blackberries, and pulpy, green skinned fruit that 
looked remarkably like pears. 

So far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries they had seen, 
though the trees and bushed were laden with them. 

"Look at it this way," Ford Prefect had said, "fruit and berries on 
strange planets either make you live or make you die. Therefore the 
point at which to start toying with them is when you're going to die if 
you don't. That way you stay ahead. The secret of healthy hitch-hiking 
is to eat junk food." 

They looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion. It 
looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger. 

"Look at it this way," said Ford, "er..." 

"Yes?" said Arthur. 

"I'm trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get to 
eat it," said Ford. 



The leaf-dappled sun gleamed on the pulp skins of the things which 
looked like pears. The things which looked like raspberries and 
strawberries were fatter and riper than any Arthur had ever seen, 
even in ice cream commercials. 

"Why don't we eat them and think about it afterwards?" he said. 

"Maybe that's what they want us to do." 

"Alright, look at it this way..." 

"Sounds good so far." 

"It's there for us to eat. Either it's good or it's bad, either they want 
to feed us or to poison us. If it's poisonous and we don't eat it they'll 
just attack us some other way. If we don't eat, we lose out either 
way." 

"I like the way you're thinking," said Ford, "Now eat one." 

Hesitantly, Arthur picked up one of those things that looked like 
pears. 

"I always thought that about the Garden of Eden story," said Ford. 

"Eh?" 

"Garden of Eden. Tree. Apple. That bit, remember?" 

"Yes of course I do." 

"Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and 
says do what you like guys, oh, but don't eat the apple. Surprise 
surprise, they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting 
'Gotcha'. It wouldn't have made any difference if they hadn't eaten 
it." 

"Why not?" 

"Because if you're dealing with somebody who has the sort of 
mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under 
them you know perfectly well they won't give up. They'll get you in 
the end." 

"What are you talking about?" 

"Never mind, eat the fruit." 

"You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden." 

"Eat the fruit." 

"Sounds quite like it too." 

Arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear. 



"It's a pear," he said. 

A few moments later, when they had eaten the lot, Ford Prefect 
turned round and called out. 

"Thank you. Thank you very much," he called, "you're very kind." 

They went on their way. 

For the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they kept on 
finding the occasional gift of fruit lying in their path, and though they 
once or twice had a quick glimpse of a native man-creature amongst 
the trees, they never again made direct contact. They decided they 
rather liked a race of people who made it clear that they were 
grateful simply to be left alone. 

The fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles, because that was 
where the sea started. 

Flaving no pressing calls on their time they built a raft and crossed 
the sea. It was reasonably calm, only about sixty miles wide and they 
had a reasonably pleasant crossing, landing in a country that was at 
least as beautiful as the one they had left. 

Life was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a while at least they 
were able to cope with the problems of aimlessness and isolation by 
deciding to ignore them. When the craving for company became too 
great they would know where to find it, but for the moment they 
were happy to feel that the Golgafrinchans were hundreds of miles 
behind them. 

Nevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic 
more often again. Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was so 
faint and from such enormous distance that it depressed him more 
than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken. 

On a whim they turned northwards. After weeks of travelling they 
came to another sea, built another raft and crossed it. This time it was 
harder going, the climate was getting colder. Arthur suspected a 
streak of masochism in Ford Prefect - the increasing difficulty of the 
journey seemed to give him a sense of purpose that was otherwise 
lacking. Fie strode onwards relentlessly. 

Their journey northwards brought them into steep mountainous 
terrain of breathtaking sweep and beauty. The vast, jagged, snow 



covered peaks ravished their senses. The cold began to bite into their 
bones. 

They wrapped themselves in animal skins and furs which Ford 
Prefect acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of ex- 
Pralite monks running a Mind-Surfing resort in the Hills of Hunian. 

The galaxy is littered with ex-Pralite monks, all on the make, 
because the mental control techniques the Order have evolved as a 
form of devotional discipline are, frankly, sensational - and 
extraordinary numbers of monks leave the Order just after they have 
finished their devotional training and just before they take their final 
vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives. 

Ford's technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a 
while and smiling. 

After a while an animal - a deer perhaps - would appear from out 
of the trees and watch him cautiously. Ford would continue to smile 
at it, his eyes would soften and shine, and he would seem to radiate a 
deep and universal love, a love which reached out to embrace all of 
creation. A wonderful quietness would descend on the surrounding 
countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from this transfigured 
man. Slowly the deer would approach, step by step, until it was 
almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect would reach out to it 
and break its neck. 

"Pheromone control," he said it was, "you just have to know how 
to generate the right smell." 



Chapter 31 


A few days after landing in this mountainous land they hit a 
coastline which swept diagonally before them from the south-west to 
the north-east, a coastline of monumental grandeur: deep majestic 
ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice-fjords. 

For two further days they scrambled and climbed over the rocks 
and glaciers, awe-struck with beauty. 

"Arthur!" yelled Ford suddenly. 

It was the afternoon of the second day. Arthur was sitting on a high 
rock watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the craggy 
promontories. 

"Arthur!" yelled Ford again. 

Arthur looked to where Ford's voice had come from, carried faintly 
in the wind. 

Ford had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur found him there 
crouching by the solid wall of blue ice. Fie was tense with excitement 
- his eyes darted up to meet Arthur's. 

"Look," he said, "look!" 

Arthur looked. Fie saw the solid wall of blue ice. 

"Yes," he said, "it's a glacier. I've already seen it." 

"No," said Ford, "you've looked at it, you haven't seen it. Look!" 

Ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice. 

Arthur peered - he saw nothing but vague shadows. 

"Move back from it," insisted Ford, "look again." 

Arthur moved back and looked again. 

"No," he said, and shrugged. "What am I supposed to be looking 
for?" 

And suddenly he saw it. 

"You see it?" 


Fie saw it. 



His mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it hadn't got 
anything to say yet and shut it again. His brain then started to 
contend with the problem of what his eyes told it they were looking 
at, but in doing so relinquished control of the mouth which promptly 
fell open again. Once more gathering up the jaw, his brain lost control 
of his left hand which then wandered around in an aimless fashion. 

For a second or so the brain tried to catch the left hand without 
letting go of the mouth and simultaneously tried to think about what 
was buried in the ice, which is probably why the legs went and Arthur 
dropped restfully to the ground. 

The thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a network 
of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the surface. 
Looked at it from the right angle they resolved into the solid shapes of 
letters from an alien alphabet, each about three feet high; and for 
those, like Arthur, who couldn't read Magrathean there was above 
the letters the outline of a face hanging in the ice. 

It was an old face, thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind. 

It was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the 
coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on. 



Chapter 32 


A thin whine filled the air. It whirled and howled through the trees 
upsetting the squirrels. A few birds flew off in disgust. The noise 
danced and skittered round the clearing. It whooped, it rasped, it 
generally offended. 

The Captain, however, regarded the lone bagpiper with an 
indulgent eye. Little could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once he 
had got over the loss of his gorgeous bath during that unpleasantness 
in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to find his new life 
remarkably congenial. A hollow had been scooped out of a large rock 
which stood in the middle of the clearing, and in this he would bask 
daily whilst attendants sloshed water over him. Not particularly warm 
water, it must be said, as they hadn't yet worked out a way of heating 
it. Never mind, that would come, and in the meantime search parties 
were scouring the countryside far and wide for a hot spring, 
preferably one in a nice leafy glade, and if it was near a soap mine - 
perfection. To those who said that they had a feeling soap wasn't 
found in mines, the Captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps 
that was because no one had looked hard enough, and this possibility 
had been reluctantly acknowledged. 

No, life was very pleasant, and the greatest thing about it was that 
when the hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en suite, 
and when in the fullness of time the cry came reverberating across 
the hills that the soap mine had been located and was producing five 
hundred cakes a day it would be more pleasant still. It was very 
important to have things to look forward to. 

Wail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the bagpipes, 
increasing the Captain's already considerable pleasure at the thought 
that any moment now they might stop. That was something he 
looked forward to as well. 

What else was pleasant, he asked himself? Well, so many things: 
the red and gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching; the 
peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a couple of 



hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing art director and 
his assistant; the sunlight gleaming off the six shiny telephones lined 
up along the edge of his rock-hewn bath. The only thing nicer than a 
phone that didn't ring all the time (or indeed at all) was six phones 
that didn't ring all the time (or indeed at all). 

Nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of people 
slowly assembling in the clearing around him to watch the afternoon 
committee meeting. 

The Captain punched his rubber duck playfully on the beak. The 
afternoon committee meetings were his favourite. 

Other eyes watched the assembling crowds. High in a tree on the 
edge of the clearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from 
foreign climes. After his six month journey he was lean and healthy, 
his eyes gleamed, he wore a reindeer-skin coat; his beard was as thick 
and his face as bronzed as a country-rock singer's. 

He and Arthur Dent had been watching the Golgafrinchans for 
almost a week now, and Ford had decided to stir things up a bit. 

The clearing was now full. Hundreds of men and women lounged 
around, chatting, eating fruit, playing cards and generally having a 
fairly relaxed time of it. Their track suits were now all dirty and even 
torn, but they all had immaculately styled hair. Ford was puzzled to 
see that many of them had stuffed their track suits full of leaves and 
wondered if this was meant to be some form of insulation against the 
coming winter. Ford's eyes narrowed. They couldn't be interested in 
botany of a sudden could they? 

In the middle of these speculations the Captain's voice rose above 
the hubbub. 

"Alright," he said, "I'd like to call this meeting to some sort of order 
if that's at all possible. Is that alright with everybody?" He smiled 
genially. "In a minute. When you're all ready." 

The talking gradually died away and the clearing fell silent, except 
for the bagpiper who seemed to be in some wild and uninhabitable 
musical world of his own. A few of those in his immediate vicinity 
threw some leaves to him. If there was any reason for this then it 
escaped Ford Prefect for the moment. 



A small group of people had clustered round the Captain and one 
of them was clearly beginning to speak. He did this by standing up, 
clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance as if to signify 
to the crowd that he would be with them in a minute. 

The crowd of course were riveted and all turned their eyes on him. 

A moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be the right 
dramatic moment to make his entry. The man turned to speak. 

Ford dropped down out of the tree. 

"Hi there," he said. 

The crowd swivelled round. 

"Ah my dear fellow," called out the Captain, "Got any matches on 
you? Or a lighter? Anything like that?" 

"No," said Ford, sounding a little deflated. It wasn't what he'd 
prepared. He decided he'd better be a little stronger on the subject. 

"No I haven't," he continued, "No matches. Instead I bring you 
news..." 

"Pity," said the Captain, "We've all run out you see. Haven't had a 
hot bath in weeks." 

Ford refused to be headed off. 

"I bring you news," he said, "of a discovery that might interest 
you." 

"Is it on the agenda?" snapped the man whom Ford had 
interrupted. 

Ford smiled a broad country-rock singer smile. 

"Now, come on," he said. 

"Well I'm sorry," said the man huffily, "but speaking as a 
management consultant of many years' standing, I must insist on the 
importance of observing the committee structure." 

Ford looked round the crowd. 

"He's mad you know," he said, "this is a prehistoric planet." 

"Address the chair!" snapped the management consultant. 

"There isn't chair," explained Ford, "there's only a rock." 

The management consultant decided that testiness was what the 
situation now called for. 

"Well, call it a chair," he said testily. 



"Why not call it a rock?" asked Ford. 

"You obviously have no conception," said the management 
consultant, not abandoning testiness in favour of good old fashioned 
hauteur, "of modern business methods." 

"And you have no conception of where you are," said Ford. 

A girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it. 

"Shut up, you two," she said, "I want to table a motion." 

"You mean boulder a motion," tittered a hairdresser. 

"Order, order!" yapped the management consultant. 

"Alright," said Ford, "let's see how you are doing." Fie plonked 
himself down on the ground to see how long he could keep his 
temper. 

The Captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise. 

"I would like to call to order," he said pleasantly, "the five hundred 
and seventy-third meeting of the colonization committee of 
Fintlewoodlewix..." 

Ten seconds, thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again. 

"This is futile," he exclaimed, "five hundred and seventy-three 
committee meetings and you haven't even discovered fire yet!" 

"If you would care," said the girl with the strident voice, "to 
examine the agenda sheet..." 

"Agenda rock," trilled the hairdresser happily. 

"Thank you, I've made that point," muttered Ford. 

"... you... will... see..." continued the girl firmly, "that we are having 
a report from the hairdressers' Fire Development Sub-Committee 
today." 

"Oh... ah - " said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which is 
recognized the whole Galaxy over as meaning "Er, will next Tuesday 
do?" 

"Alright," said Ford, rounding on him, "what have you done? What 
are you going to do? What are your thoughts on fire development?" 

"Well I don't know," said the hairdresser, "All they gave me was a 
couple of sticks..." 

"So what have you done with them?" 

Nervously, the hairdresser fished in his track suit top and handed 
over the fruits of his labour to Ford. 



Ford held them up for all to see. 

"Curling tongs," he said. 

The crowd applauded. 

"Never mind," said Ford, "Rome wasn't burnt in a day." 

The crowd hadn't the faintest idea what he was talking about, but 
they loved it nevertheless. They applauded. 

"Well, you're obviously being totally naive of course," said the girl, 
"When you've been in marketing as long as I have you'll know that 
before any new product can be developed it has to be properly 
researched. We've got to find out what people want from fire, how 
they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them." 

The crowd were tense. They were expecting something wonderful 
from Ford. 

"Stick it up your nose," he said. 

"Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know," insisted the 
girl, "Do people want fire that can be applied nasally?" 

"Do you?" Ford asked the crowd. 

"Yes!" shouted some. 

"No!" shouted others happily. 

They didn't know, they just thought it was great. 

"And the wheel," said the Captain, "What about this wheel thingy? 
It sounds a terribly interesting project." 

"Ah," said the marketing girl, "Well, we're having a little difficulty 
there." 

"Difficulty?" exclaimed Ford, "Difficulty? What do you mean, 
difficulty? It's the single simplest machine in the entire Universe!" 

The marketing girl soured him with a look. 

"Alright, Mr. Wiseguy," she said, "you're so clever, you tell us what 
colour it should have." 

The crowd went wild. One up to the home team, they thought. 

Ford shrugged his shoulders and sat down again. 

"Almighty Zarquon," he said, "have none of you done anything?" 

As if in answer to his question there was a sudden clamour of noise 
from the entrance to the clearing. The crowd couldn't believe the 
amount of entertainment they were getting this afternoon: in 
marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the remnants of 



their Golgafrincham 3rd Regiment dress uniforms. About half of them 
still carried Kill-O-Zap guns, the rest now carried spears which they 
struck together as they marched. They looked bronzed, healthy, and 
utterly exhausted and bedraggled. They clattered to a halt and 
banged to attention. One of them fell over and never moved again. 

"Captain, sir!" cried Number Two - for he was their leader - 
"Permission to report sir!" 

"Yes, alright Number Two, welcome back and all that. Find any hot 
springs?" said the Captain despondently. 

"No sir!" 

"Thought you wouldn't." 

Number Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before 
the bath. 

"We have discovered another continent!" 

"When was this?" 

"It lies across the sea..." said Number Two, narrowing his eyes 
significantly, "to the east!" 

"Ah." 

Number Two turned to face the crowd. He raised his gun above his 
head. This is going to be great, thought the crowd. 

"We have declared war on it!" 

Wild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the clearing - 
this was beyond all expectation. 

"Wait a minute," shouted Ford Prefect, "wait a minute!" 

He leapt to his feet and demanded silence. After a while he got it, 
or at least the best silence he could hope for under the circumstances: 
the circumstances were that the bagpiper was spontaneously 
composing a national anthem. 

"Do we have to have the piper?" demanded Ford. 

"Oh yes," said the Captain, "we've given him a grant." 

Ford considered opening this idea up for debate but quickly 
decided that that way madness lay. Instead he slung a well judged 
rock at the piper and turned to face Number Two. 

"War?" he said. 

"Yes!" Number Two gazed contemptuously at Ford Prefect. 

"On the next continent?" 



"Yes! Total warfare! The war to end all wars!" 

"But there's no one even living there yet!" 

Ah, interesting, thought the crowd, nice point. 

Number Two's gaze hovered undisturbed. In this respect his eyes 
were like a couple of mosquitos that hover purposefully three inches 
from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes, fly swats 
or rolled newspapers. 

"I know that," he said, "but there will be one day! So we have left 
an open-ended ultimatum." 

"What?" 

"And blown up a few military installations." 

The Captain leaned forward out of his bath. 

"Military installations Number Two?" he said. 

For a moment the eyes wavered. 

"Yes sir, well potential military installations. Alright... trees." 

The moment of uncertainty passed - his eyes flickered like whips 
over his audience. 

"And," he roared, "we interrogated a gazelle!" 

He flipped his Kill-O-Zap gun smartly under his arm and marched 
off through the pandemonium that had now erupted throughout the 
ecstatic crowd. A few steps was all he managed before he was caught 
up and carried shoulder high for a lap of honour round the clearing. 

Ford sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together. 

"So what else have you done?" he inquired after the celebrations 
had died down. 

"We have started a culture," said the marketing girl. 

"Oh yes?" said Ford. 

"Yes. One of our film producers is already making a fascinating 
documentary about the indigenous cavemen of the area." 

"They're not cavemen." 

"They look like cavemen." 

"Do they live in caves?" 

"Well..." 


"They live in huts." 



"Perhaps they're having their caves redecorated," called out a wag 
from the crowd. 

Ford rounded on him angrily. 

"Very funny," he said, "but have you noticed that they're dying 
out?" 

On their journey back. Ford and Arthur had come across two 
derelict villages and the bodies of many natives in the woods, where 
they had crept away to die. Those that still lived were stricken and 
listless, as if they were suffering some disease of the spirit rather than 
the body. They moved sluggishly and with an infinite sadness. Their 
future had been taken away from them. 

"Dying out!" repeated Ford. "Do you know what that means?" 

"Er... we shouldn't sell them any life insurance?" called out the wag 
again. 

Ford ignored him, and appealed to the whole crowd. 

"Can you try and understand," he said, "that it's just since we've 
arrived that they've started dying out!" 

"In fact that comes over terribly well in this film," said the 
marketing girl, "and just gives it that poignant twist which is the 
hallmark of the really great documentary. The producer's very 
committed." 

"Fie should be," muttered Ford. 

"I gather," said the girl, turning to address the Captain who was 
beginning to nod off, "that he wants to make one about you next, 
Captain." 

"Oh really?" he said, coming to with a start, "that's awfully nice." 

"Fle's got a very strong angle on it, you know, the burden of 
responsibility, the loneliness of command..." 

The Captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment. 

"Well, I wouldn't overstress that angle, you know," he said finally, 
"one's never alone with a rubber duck." 

Fie held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from the 
crowd. 

All the while, the Management Consultant had been sitting in stony 
silence, his finger tips pressed to his temples to indicate that he was 
waiting and would wait all day if it was necessary. 



At this point he decided he would not wait all day after all, he 
would merely pretend that the last half hour hadn't happened. 

He rose to his feet. 

"If," he said tersely, "we could for a moment move on to the 
subject of fiscal policy..." 

"Fiscal policy!" whooped Ford Prefect, "Fiscal policy!" 

The Management Consultant gave him a look that only a lungfish 
could have copied. 

"Fiscal policy..." he repeated, "that is what I said." 

"How can you have money," demanded Ford, "if none of you 
actually produces anything? It doesn't grow on trees you know." 

"If you would allow me to continue..." 

Ford nodded dejectedly. 

"Thank you. Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as 
legal tender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich." 

Ford stared in disbelief at the crowd who were murmuring 
appreciatively at this and greedily fingering the wads of leaves with 
which their track suits were stuffed. 

"But we have also," continued the Management Consultant, "run 
into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf 
availability, which means that, I gather, the current going rate has 
something like three deciduous forests buying one ship's peanut." 

Murmurs of alarm came from the crowd. The Management 
Consultant waved them down. 

"So in order to obviate this problem," he continued, "and 
effectively revaluate the leaf, we are about to embark on a massive 
defoliation campaign, and... er, burn down all the forests. I think you'll 
all agree that's a sensible move under the circumstances." 

The crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or two 
until someone pointed out how much this would increase the value of 
the leaves in their pockets whereupon they let out whoops of delight 
and gave the Management Consultant a standing ovation. The 
accountants amongst them looked forward to a profitable Autumn. 

"You're all mad," explained Ford Prefect. 

"You're absolutely barmy," he suggested. 

"You're a bunch of raving nutters," he opined. 



The tide of opinion started to turn against him. What had started 
out as excellent entertainment had now, in the crowd's view, 
deteriorated into mere abuse, and since this abuse was in the main 
directed at them they wearied of it. 

Sensing this shift in the wind, the marketing girl turned on him. 

"Is it perhaps in order," she demanded, "to inquire what you've 
been doing all these months then? You and that other interloper have 
been missing since the day we arrived." 

"We've been on a journey," said Ford, "We went to try and find out 
something about this planet." 

"Oh," said the girl archly, "doesn't sound very productive to me." 

"No? Well have I got news for you, my love. We have discovered 
this planet's future." 

Ford waited for this statement to have its effect. It didn't have any. 
They didn't know what he was talking about. 

He continued. 

"It doesn't matter a pair of fetid dingo's kidneys what you all 
choose to do from now on. Burn down the forests, anything, it won't 
make a scrap of difference. Your future history has already happened. 
Two million years you've got and that's it. At the end of that time your 
race will be dead, gone and good riddance to you. Remember that, 
two million years!" 

The crowd muttered to itself in annoyance. People as rich as they 
had suddenly become shouldn't be obliged to listen to this sort of 
gibberish. Perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and he 
would go away. 

They didn't need to bother. Ford was already stalking out of the 
clearing, pausing only to shake his head at Number Two who was 
already firing his Kill-O-Zap gun into some neighbouring trees. 

Fie turned back once. 

"Two million years!" he said and laughed. 

"Well," said the Captain with a soothing smile, "still time for a few 
more baths. Could someone pass me the sponge? I just dropped it 
over the side." 



Chapter 33 


A mile or so away through the wood, Arthur Dent was too busily 
engrossed with what he was doing to hear Ford Prefect approach. 

What he was doing was rather curious, and this is what it was: on a 
wide flat piece of rock he had scratched out the shape of a large 
square, subdivided into one hundred and sixty-nine smaller squares, 
thirteen to a side. 

Furthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish 
stones and scratched the shape of a letter on to each. Sitting 
morosely round the rock were a couple of the surviving local native 
men whom Arthur Dent was trying to introduce the curious concept 
embodied in these stones. 

So far they had not done well. They had attempted to eat some of 
them, bury others and throw the rest of them away. Arthur had finally 
encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones on the board he 
had scratched out, which was not even as far as he'd managed to get 
the day before. Along with the rapid deterioration in the morale of 
these creatures, there seemed to be a corresponding deterioration in 
their actual intelligence. 

In an attempt to egg them along, Arthur set out a number of letters 
on the board himself, and then tried to encourage the natives to add 
some more themselves. 

It was not going well. 

Ford watched quietly from beside a nearby tree. 

"No," said Arthur to one of the natives who had just shuffled some 
of the letters round in a fit of abysmal dejection, "Q scores ten you 
see, and it's on a triple word score, so... look. I've explained the rules 
to you... no no, look please, put down that jawbone... alright, we'll 
start again. And try to concentrate this time." 

Ford leaned his elbow against the tree and his hand against his 
head. 

"What are you doing, Arthur?" he asked quietly. 



Arthur looked up with a start. He suddenly had a feeling that all 
this might look slightly foolish. All he knew was that it had worked like 
a dream on him when he was a child. But things were different then, 
or rather would be. 

"I'm trying to teach the cavemen to play Scrabble," he said. 

"They're not cavemen," said Ford. 

"They look like cavemen." 

Ford let it pass. 

"I see," he said. 

"It's uphill work," said Arthur wearily, "the only word they know is 
grunt and they can't spell it." 

He sighed and sat back. 

"What's that supposed to achieve?" asked Ford. 

"We've got to encourage them to evolve! To develop!" Arthur 
burst out angrily. He hoped that the weary sigh and then the anger 
might do something to counteract the overriding feeling of 
foolishness from which he was currently suffering. It didn't. He 
jumped to his feet. 

"Can you imagine what a world would be like descended from 
those... cretins we arrived with?" he said. 

"Imagine?" said Ford, rising his eyebrows. "We don't have to 
imagine. We've seen it." 

"But..." Arthur waved his arms about hopelessly. 

"We've seen it," said Ford, "there's no escape." 

Arthur kicked at a stone. 

"Did you tell them what we've discovered?" he asked. 

"Hmmmm?" said Ford, not really concentrating. 

"Norway," said Arthur, "Slartibartfast's signature in the glacier. Did 
you tell them?" 

"What's the point?" said Ford, "What would it mean to them?" 

"Mean?" said Arthur, "Mean? You know perfectly well what it 
means. It means that this planet is the Earth! It's my home! It's where 
I was born!" 

"Was?" said Ford. 

"Alright, will be." 



"Yes, in two million years' time. Why don't you tell them that? Go 
and say to them, 'Excuse me, I'd just like to point out that in two 
million years' time I will be born just a few miles from here.' See what 
they say. They'll chase you up a tree and set fire to it." 

Arthur absorbed this unhappily. 

"Face it," said Ford, "those zeebs over there are your ancestors, not 
these poor creatures here." 

Fie went over to where the apemen creatures were rummaging 
listlessly with the stone letters. Fie shook his head. 

"Put the Scrabble away, Arthur," he said, "it won't save the human 
race, because this lot aren't going to be the human race. The human 
race is currently sitting round a rock on the other side of this hill 
making documentaries about themselves." 

Arthur winced. 

"There must be something we can do," he said. A terrible sense of 
desolation thrilled through his body that he should be here, on the 
Earth, the Earth which had lost its future in a horrifying arbitrary 
catastrophe and which now seemed set to lose its past as well. 

"No," said Ford, "there's nothing we can do. This doesn't change 
the history of the Earth, you see, this is the history of the Earth. Like it 
or leave it, the Golgafrinchans are the people you are descended from. 
In two million years they get destroyed by the Vogons. FHistory is 
never altered you see, it just fits together like a jigsaw. Funny old 
thing, life, isn't it?" 

Fie picked up the letter Q and hurled it into a distant pivet bush 
where it hit a young rabbit. The rabbit hurtled off in terror and didn't 
stop till it was set upon and eaten by a fox which choked on one of its 
bones and died on the bank of a stream which subsequently washed 
it away. 

During the following weeks Ford Prefect swallowed his pride and 
struck up a relationship with a girl who had been a personnel officer 
on Golgafrincham, and he was terribly upset when she suddenly 
passed away as a result of drinking water from a pool that had been 
polluted by the body of a dead fox. The only moral it is possible to 
draw from this story is that one should never throw the letter Q into a 
pivet bush, but unfortunately there are times when it is unavoidable. 



Like most of the really crucial things in life, this chain of events was 
completely invisible to Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. They were 
looking sadly at one of the natives morosely pushing the other letters 
around. 

"Poor bloody caveman," said Arthur. 

"They're not..." 

"What?" 

"Oh never mind." 

The wretched creature let out a pathetic howling noise and banged 
on the rock. 

"It's all been a bit of waste of time for them, hasn't it?" said Arthur. 

"Uh uh urghhhhh," muttered the native and banged on the rock 
again. 

"They've been outevolved by telephone sanitizers." 

"Urgh, gr gr, gruh!" insisted the native, continuing to bang on the 
rock. 

"Why does he keep banging on the rock?" said Arthur. 

"I think he probably wants you to Scrabble with him again," said 
Ford, "he's pointing at the letters." 

"Probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again, poor bastard. I keep on 
telling him there's only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc." 

The native banged on the rock again. 

They looked over his shoulder. 

Their eyes popped. 

There amongst the jumble of letters were eight that had been laid 
out in a clear straight line. 

They spelt two words. 

The words were these: 

"Forty-Two." 

"Grrrurgh guh guh," explained the native. He swept the letters 
angrily away and went and mooched under a nearby tree with his 
colleague. 

Ford and Arthur stared at him. Then they stared at each other. 

"Did that say what I thought it said?" they both said to each other. 

"Yes," they both said. 



"Forty-two," said Arthur. 

"Forty-two," said Ford. 

Arthur ran over to the two natives. 

"What are you trying to tell us?" he shouted. "What's it supposed 
to mean?" 

One of them rolled over on the ground, kicked his legs up in the air, 
rolled over again and went to sleep. 

The other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts at Ford 
Prefect. Whatever it was they had to say, they had already said it. 

"You know what this means," said Ford. 

"Not entirely." 

"Forty-two is the number Deep Thought gave as being the Ultimate 
Answer." 

"Yes." 

And the Earth is the computer Deep Thought designed and built to 
calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer." 

"So we are led to believe." 

"And organic life was part of the computer matrix." 

"If you say so." 

"I do say so. That means that these natives, these apemen are an 
integral part of the computer program, and that we and the 
Golgafrinchans are not." 

"But the cavemen are dying out and the Golgafrinchans are 
obviously set to replace them." 

"Exactly. So do you see what this means?" 

"What?" 

"Cock up," said Ford Prefect. 

Arthur looked around him. 

"This planet is having a pretty bloody time of it," he said. 

Ford puzzled for a moment. 

"Still, something must have come out of it," he said at last, 

"because Marvin said he could see the Question printed in your brain 
wave patterns." 

"But..." 



"Probably the wrong one, or a distortion of the right one. It might 
give us a clue though if we could find it. I don't see how we can 
though." 

They moped about for a bit. Arthur sat on the ground and started 
pulling up bits of grass, but found that it wasn't an occupation he 
could get deeply engrossed in. It wasn't grass he could believe in, the 
trees seemed pointless, the rolling hills seemed to be rolling to 
nowhere and the future seemed just a tunnel to be crawled through. 

Ford fiddled with his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It was silent. He 
sighed and put it away. 

Arthur picked up one of the letter stones from his home-made 
Scrabble set. It was a T. He sighed and out it down again. The letter he 
put down next to it was an I. That spelt IT. He tossed another couple 
of letters next to them They were an S and an H as it happened. By a 
curious coincidence the resulting word perfectly expressed the way 
Arthur was feeling about things just then. He stared at it for a 
moment. He hadn't done it deliberately, it was just a random chance. 
His brain got slowly into first gear. 

"Ford," he said suddenly, "look, if that Question is printed in my 
brain wave patterns but I'm not consciously aware of it it must be 
somewhere in my unconscious." 

"Yes, I suppose so." 

"There might be a way of bringing that unconscious pattern 
forward." 

"Oh yes?" 

"Yes, by introducing some random element that can be shaped by 
that pattern." 

"Like how?" 

"Like by pulling Scrabble letters out of a bag blindfolded." 

Ford leapt to his feet. 

"Brilliant!" he said. He tugged his towel out of his satchel and with 
a few deft knots transformed it into a bag. 

"Totally mad," he said, "utter nonsense. But we'll do it because it's 
brilliant nonsense. Come on, come on." 

The sun passed respectfully behind a cloud. A few small sad 
raindrops fell. 



They piled together all the remaining letters and dropped them 
into the bag. They shook them up. 

"Right," said Ford, "close your eyes. Pull them out. Come on come 
on, come on." 

Arthur closed his eyes and plunged his hand into the towelful of 
stones. He jiggled them about, pulled out four and handed them to 
Ford. Ford laid them along the ground in the order he got them. 

"W," said Ford, "H, A, T... What!" 

He blinked. 

"I think it's working!" he said. 

Arthur pushed three more at him. 

"D, O, Y... Doy. Oh perhaps it isn't working," said Ford. 

"Here's the next three." 

"O, U, G... Doyoug... It's not making sense I'm afraid." 

Arthur pulled another two from the bag. Ford put them in place. 

"E, T, doyouget... Do you get!" shouted Ford, "it is working! This is 
amazing, it really is working!" 

"More here." Arthur was throwing them out feverishly as fast as he 
could go. 

"I, F," said Ford, "Y, O, U,... M, U, L, T, I, P, L, Y,... What do you get if 
you multiply,... S, I, X,... six, B, Y, by, six by... what do you get if you 
multiply six by... N, I, N, E,... six by nine..." He paused. "Come on, 
where's the next one?" 

"Er, that's the lot," said Arthur, "that's all there were." 

He sat back, nonplussed. 

He rooted around again in the knotted up towel but there were no 
more letters. 

"You mean that's it?" said Ford. 

"That's it." 

"Six by nine. Forty-two." 

"That's it. That's all there is." 



Chapter 34 


The sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them. A bird sang. A 
warm breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the 
flowers, carrying their scent away through the woods. An insect 
droned past on its way to do whatever it is that insects do in the late 
afternoon. The sound of voices lilted through the trees followed a 
moment later by two girls who stopped in surprise at the sight of Ford 
Prefect and Arthur Dent apparently lying on the ground in agony, but 
in fact rocking with noiseless laughter. 

"No, don't go," called Ford Prefect between gasps, "we'll be with 
you in a moment." 

"What's the matter?" asked one of the girls. She was the taller and 
slimmer of the two. On Golgafrincham she had been a junior 
personnel officer, but hadn't liked it much. 

Ford pulled himself together. 

"Excuse me," he said, "hello. My friend and I were just 
contemplating the meaning of life. Frivolous exercise." 

"Oh it's you," said the girl, "you made a bit of a spectacle of 
yourself this afternoon. You were quite funny to begin with but you 
did bang on a bit." 

"Did I? Oh yes." 

"Yes, what was all that for?" asked the other girl, a shorter round- 
faced girl who had been an art director for a small advertising 
company on Golgafrincham. Whatever the privations of this world 
were, she went to sleep every night profoundly grateful for the fact 
that whatever she had to face in the morning it wouldn't be a 
hundred almost identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of 
toothpaste. 

"For? For nothing. Nothing's for anything," said Ford Prefect 
happily. "Come and join us. I'm Ford, this is Arthur. We were just 
about to do nothing at all for a while but it can wait." 

The girls looked at them doubtfully. 



"I'm Agda," said the tall one, "this is Mella." 

"Hello Agda, hello Mella," said Ford. 

"Do you talk at all?" said Mella to Arthur. 

"Oh, eventually," said Arthur with a smile, "but not as much as 
Ford." 

"Good." 

There was a slight pause. 

"What did you mean," asked Agda, "about only having two million 
years? I couldn't make sense of what you were saying." 

"Oh that," said Ford, "it doesn't matter." 

"It's just that the world gets demolished to make way for a 
hyperspace bypass," said Arthur with a shrug, "but that's two million 
years away, and anyway it's just Vogons doing what Vogons do." 

"Vogons?" said Mella. 

"Yes, you wouldn't know them." 

"Where'd you get this idea from?" 

"It really doesn't matter. It's just like a dream from the past, or the 
future." Arthur smiled and looked away. 

"Does it worry you that you don't talk any kind of sense?" asked 
Agda. 

"Listen, forget it," said Ford, "forget all of it. Nothing matters. Look, 
it's a beautiful day, enjoy it. The sun, the green of the hills, the river 
down in the valley, the burning trees." 

"Even if it's only a dream, it's a pretty horrible idea," said Mella, 
"destroying a world just to make a bypass." 

"Oh, I've heard of worse," said Ford, "I read of one planet off in the 
seventh dimension that got used as a ball in a game of intergalactic 
bar billiards. Got potted straight into a black hole. Killed ten billion 
people." 

"That's mad," said Mella. 

"Yes, only scored thirty points too." 

Agda and Mella exchanged glances. 

"Look," said Agda, "there's a party after the committee meeting 
tonight. You can come along if you like." 


"Yeah, OK," said Ford. 



"I'd like to," said Arthur. 


Many hours later Arthur and Mella sat and watched the moon rise 
over the dull red glow of the trees. 

"That story about the world being destroyed..." began Mella. 

"In two million years, yes." 

"You say it as if you really think it's true." 

"Yes, I think it is. I think I was there." 

She shook her head in puzzlement. 

"You're very strange," she said. 

"No, I'm very ordinary," said Arthur, "but some very strange things 
have happened to me. You could say I'm more differed from than 
differing." 

"And that other world your friend talked about, the one that got 
pushed into a black hole." 

"Ah, that I don't know about. It sounds like something from the 
book." 

"What book?" 

Arthur paused. 

"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," he said at last. 

"What's that?" 

"Oh, just something I threw into the river this evening. I don't think 
I'll be wanting it any more," said Arthur Dent. 



DOUGLAS ADAMS 


LIFE, THE UNIVERSE AND 
EVERYTHING 

for Sally 



Chapter 1 


The regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of Arthur 
Dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was. 

It wasn't just that the cave was cold, it wasn't just that it was damp 
and smelly. It was the fact that the cave was in the middle of Islington 
and there wasn't a bus due for two million years. 

Time is the worst place, so to speak, to get lost in, as Arthur Dent 
could testify, having been lost in both time and space a good deal. At 
least being lost in space kept you busy. 

He was stranded in prehistoric Earth as the result of a complex 
sequence of events which had involved him being alternately blown 
up and insulted in more bizarre regions of the Galaxy than he ever 
dreamt existed, and though his life had now turned very, very, very 
quiet, he was still feeling jumpy. 

He hadn't been blown up now for five years. 

Since he had hardly seen anyone since he and Ford Prefect had 
parted company four years previously, he hadn't been insulted in all 
that time either. 

Except just once. 

It had happened on a spring evening about two years previously. 

He was returning to his cave just a little after dusk when he 
became aware of lights flashing eerily through the clouds. He turned 
and stared, with hope suddenly clambering through his heart. Rescue. 
Escape. The castaway's impossible dream - a ship. 

And as he watched, as he stared in wonder and excitement, a long 
silver ship descended through the warm evening air, quietly, without 
fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology. 

It alighted gently on the ground, and what little hum it had 
generated died away, as if lulled by the evening calm. 

A ramp extended itself. 

Light streamed out. 



A tall figure appeared silhouetted in the hatchway. It walked down 
the ramp and stood in front of Arthur. 

"You're a jerk. Dent," it said simply. 

It was alien, very alien. It had a peculiar alien tallness, a peculiar 
alien flattened head, peculiar slitty little alien eyes, extravagantly 
draped golden ropes with a peculiarly alien collar design, and pale 
grey-green alien skin which had about it that lustrous shine which 
most grey-green faces can only acquire with plenty of exercise and 
very expensive soap. 

Arthur boggled at it. 

It gazed levelly at him. 

Arthur's first sensations of hope and trepidation had instantly been 
overwhelmed by astonishment, and all sorts of thoughts were battling 
for the use of his vocal chords at this moment. 

"Whh...?" he said. 

"Bu... hu... uh..." he added. 

"Ru... ra... wah... who?" he managed finally to say and lapsed into a 
frantic kind of silence. He was feeling the effects of having not said 
anything to anybody for as long as he could remember. 

The alien creature frowned briefly and consulted what appeared to 
be some species of clipboard which he was holding in his thin and 
spindly alien hand. 

"Arthur Dent?" it said. 

Arthur nodded helplessly. 

"Arthur Philip Dent?" pursued the alien in a kind of efficient yap. 

"Er... er... yes... er... er," confirmed Arthur. 

"You're a jerk," repeated the alien, "a complete asshole." 

"Er..." 

The creature nodded to itself, made a peculiar alien tick on its 
clipboard and turned briskly back towards the ship. 

"Er..." said Arthur desperately, "er..." 

"Don't give me that!" snapped the alien. It marched up the ramp, 
through the hatchway and disappeared into the ship. The ship sealed 
itself. It started to make a low throbbing hum. 

"Er, hey!" shouted Arthur, and started to run helplessly towards it. 

"Wait a minute!" he called. "What is this? What? Wait a minute!" 



The ship rose, as if shedding its weight like a cloak to the ground, 
and hovered briefly. It swept strangely up into the evening sky. It 
passed up through the clouds, illuminating them briefly, and then was 
gone, leaving Arthur alone in an immensity of land dancing a 
helplessly tiny little dance. 

"What?" he screamed. "What? What? Hey, what? Come back here 
and say that!" 

He jumped and danced until his legs trembled, and shouted till his 
lungs rasped. There was no answer from anyone. There was no one to 
hear him or speak to him. 

The alien ship was already thundering towards the upper reaches 
of the atmosphere, on its way out into the appalling void which 
separates the very few things there are in the Universe from each 
other. 

Its occupant, the alien with the expensive complexion, leaned back 
in its single seat. His name was Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged. 

He was a man with a purpose. Not a very good purpose, as he would 
have been the first to admit, but it was at least a purpose and it did at 
least keep him on the move. 

Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was - indeed, is - one of the 
Universe's very small number of immortal beings. 

Those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with 
it, but Wowbagger was not one of them. Indeed he had come to hate 
them, the load of serene bastards. He had had his immortality thrust 
upon him by an unfortunate accident with an irrational particle 
accelerator, a liquid lunch and a pair of rubber bands. The precise 
details of the accident are not important because no one has ever 
managed to duplicate the exact circumstances under which it 
happened, and many people have ended up looking very silly, or dead, 
or both, trying. 

Wowbagger closed his eyes in a grim and weary expression, put 
some light jazz on the ship's stereo, and reflected that he could have 
made it if it hadn't been for Sunday afternoons, he really could have 
done. 



To begin with it was fun, he had a ball, living dangerously, taking 
risks, cleaning up on high-yield long-term investments, and just 
generally outliving the hell out of everybody. 

In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn't cope with, and 
that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 2.55, when you 
know that you've had all the baths you can usefully have that day, 
that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you 
will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning 
technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands 
will move relentlessly on to four o'clock, and you will enter the long 
dark teatime of the soul. 

So things began to pall for him. The merry smiles he used to wear 
at other people's funerals began to fade. He began to despise the 
Universe in general, and everyone in it in particular. 

This was the point at which he conceived his purpose, the thing 
which would drive him on, and which, as far as he could see, would 
drive him on forever. It was this. 

He would insult the Universe. 

That is, he would insult everybody in it. Individually, personally, 
one by one, and (this was the thing he really decided to grit his teeth 
over) in alphabetical order. 

When people protested to him, as they sometimes had done, that 
the plan was not merely misGuided but actually impossible because 
of the number of people being born and dying all the time, he would 
merely fix them with a steely look and say, "A man can dream can't 
he?" 

And so he started out. He equipped a spaceship that was built to 
last with the computer capable of handling all the data processing 
involved in keeping track of the entire population of the known 
Universe and working out the horrifically complicated routes involved. 

His ship fled through the inner orbits of the Sol star system, 
preparing to slingshot round the sun and fling itself out into 
interstellar space. 

"Computer," he said. 

"Here," yipped the computer. 

"Where next?" 


"Computing that." 



Wowbagger gazed for a moment at the fantastic jewellery of the 
night, the billions of tiny diamond worlds that dusted the infinite 
darkness with light. Every one, every single one, was on his itinerary. 
Most of them he would be going to millions of times over. 

He imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots 
in the sky like a child's numbered dots puzzle. He hoped that from 
some vantage point in the Universe it might be seen to spell a very, 
very rude word. 

The computer beeped tunelessly to indicate that it had finished its 
calculations. 

"Folfanga," it said. It beeped. 

"Fourth world of the Folfanga system," it continued. It beeped 
again. 

"Estimated journey time, three weeks," it continued further. It 
beeped again. 

"There to meet with a small slug," it beeped, "of the genus A-Rth- 
Urp-Hil-lpdenu." 

"I believe," it added, after a slight pause during which it beeped, 
"that you had decided to call it a brainless prat." 

Wowbagger grunted. He watched the majesty of creation outside 
his window for a moment or two. 

"I think I'll take a nap," he said, and then added, "what network 
areas are we going to be passing through in the next few hours?" 

The computer beeped. 

"Cosmovid, Thinkpix and Home Brain Box," it said, and beeped. 

"Any movies I haven't seen thirty thousand times already?" 

"No." 

"Uh." 

"There's Angst in Space. You've only seen that thirty-three 
thousand five hundred and seventeen times." 

"Wake me for the second reel." 

The computer beeped. 

"Sleep well," it said. 

The ship fled on through the night. 



Meanwhile, on Earth, it began to pour with rain and Arthur Dent 
sat in his cave and had one of the most truly rotten evenings of his 
entire life, thinking of things he could have said to the alien and 
swatting flies, who also had a rotten evening. 

The next day he made himself a pouch out of rabbit skin because 
he thought it would be useful to keep things in. 



Chapter 2 


This morning, two years later than that, was sweet and fragrant as 
he emerged from the cave he called home until he could think of a 
better name for it or find a better cave. 

Though his throat was sore again from his early morning yell of 
horror, he was suddenly in a terrifically good mood. He wrapped his 
dilapidated dressing gown tightly around him and beamed at the 
bright morning. 

The air was clear and scented, the breeze flitted lightly through the 
tall grass around his cave, the birds were chirruping at each other, the 
butterflies were flitting about prettily, and the whole of nature 
seemed to be conspiring to be as pleasant as it possibly could. 

It wasn't all the pastoral delights that were making Arthur feel so 
cheery, though. He had just had a wonderful idea about how to cope 
with the terrible lonely isolation, the nightmares, the failure of all his 
attempts at horticulture, and the sheer futurelessness and futility of 
his life here on prehistoric Earth, which was that he would go mad. 

He beamed again and took a bite out of a rabbit leg left over from 
his supper. He chewed happily for a few moments and then decided 
formally to announce his decision. 

He stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the fields 
and hills. To add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit bone in his 
hair. He spread his arms out wide. 

"I will go mad!" he announced. 

"Good idea," said Ford Prefect, clambering down from the rock on 
which he had been sitting. 

Arthur's brain somersaulted. His jaw did press-ups. 

"I went mad for a while," said Ford, "did me no end of good." 

"You see," said Ford, 

"Where have you been?" interrupted Arthur, now that his head 
had finished working out. 



"Around," said Ford, "around and about." He grinned in what he 
accurately judged to be an infuriating manner. "I just took my mind 
off the hook for a bit. I reckoned that if the world wanted me badly 
enough it would call back. It did." 

He took out of his now terribly battered and dilapidated satchel his 
Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. 

"At least," he said, "I think it did. This has been playing up a bit." He 
shook it. "If it was a false alarm I shall go mad," he said, "again." 

Arthur shook his head and sat down. He looked up. 

"I thought you must be dead..." he said simply. 

"So did I for a while," said Ford, "and then I decided I was a lemon 
for a couple of weeks. A kept myself amused all that time jumping in 
and out of a gin and tonic." 

Arthur cleared his throat, and then did it again. 

"Where," he said, "did you...?" 

"Find a gin and tonic?" said Ford brightly. "I found a small lake that 
thought it was a gin and tonic, and jumped in and out of that. At least, 
I think it thought it was a gin and tonic." 

"I may," he added with a grin which would have sent sane men 
scampering into trees, "have been imagining it." 

He waited for a reaction from Arthur, but Arthur knew better than 
that. 

"Carry on," he said levelly. 

"The point is, you see," said Ford, "that there is no point in driving 
yourself mad trying to stop yourself going mad. You might just as well 
give in and save your sanity for later." 

"And this is you sane again, is it?" said Arthur. "I ask merely for 
information." 

"I went to Africa," said Ford. 

"Yes?" 

"Yes." 

"What was that like?" 

"And this is your cave is it?" said Ford. 

"Er, yes," said Arthur. He felt very strange. After nearly four years 
of total isolation he was so pleased and relieved to see Ford that he 



could almost cry. Ford was, on the other hand, an almost immediately 
annoying person. 

"Very nice," said Ford, in reference to Arthur's cave. "You must 
hate it." 

Arthur didn't bother to reply. 

"Africa was very interesting," said Ford, "I behaved very oddly 
there." 

Fie gazed thoughtfully into the distance. 

"I took up being cruel to animals," he said airily. "But only," he 
added, "as a hobby." 

"Oh yes," said Arthur, warily. 

"Yes," Ford assured him. "I won't disturb you with the details 
because they would - " 

"What?" 

"Disturb you. But you may be interested to know that I am 
singlehandedly responsible for the evolved shape of the animal you 
came to know in later centuries as a giraffe. And I tried to learn to fly. 
Do you believe me?" 

"Tell me," said Arthur. 

"I'll tell you later. I'll just mention that the Guide says..." 

"The...?" 

"Guide. The FHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. You remember?" 

"Yes. I remember throwing it in the river." 

"Yes," said Ford, "but I fished it out." 

"You didn't tell me." 

"I didn't want you to throw it in again." 

"Fair enough," admitted Arthur. "It says?" 

"What?" 

"The Guide says?" 

"The Guide says there is an art to flying," said Ford, "or rather a 
knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground 
and miss." FHe smiled weakly. Fie pointed at the knees of his trousers 
and held his arms up to show the elbows. They were all torn and worn 
through. 



"I haven't done very well so far," he said. He stuck out his hand. 
"I'm very glad to see you again, Arthur," he added. 

Arthur shook his head in a sudden access of emotion and 
bewilderment. 

"I haven't seen anyone for years," he said, "not anyone. I can 
hardly even remember how to speak. I keep forgetting words. I 
practise you see. I practise by talking to... talking to... what are those 
things people think you're mad if you talk to? Like George the Third." 

"Kings?" suggested Ford. 

"No, no," said Arthur. "The things he used to talk to. We're 
surrounded by them for heaven's sake. I've planted hundreds myself. 
They all died. Trees! I practise by talking to trees. What's that for?" 

Ford still had his hand stuck out. Arthur looked at it with 
incomprehension. 

"Shake," prompted Ford. 

Arthur did, nervously at first, as if it might turn out to be a fish. 
Then he grasped it vigorously with both hands in an overwhelming 
flood of relief. He shook it and shook it. 

After a while Ford found it necessary to disengage. They climbed to 
the top of a nearby outcrop of rock and surveyed the scene around 
them. 

"What happened to the Golgafrinchans?" asked Ford. 

Arthur shrugged. 

"A lot of them didn't make it through the winter three years ago," 
he said, "and the few who remained in the spring said they needed a 
holiday and set off on a raft. History says that they must have 
survived..." 

"Huh," said Ford, "well well." He stuck his hands on his hips and 
looked round again at the empty world. Suddenly, there was about 
Ford a sense of energy and purpose. 

"We're going," he said excitedly, and shivered with energy. 

"Where? How?" said Arthur. 

"I don't know," said Ford, "but I just feel that the time is right. 
Things are going to happen. We're on our way." 

He lowered his voice to a whisper. 

"I have detected," he said, "disturbances in the wash." 



He gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite 
like the wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point, but the 
wind was busy fooling around with some leaves a little way off. 

Arthur asked him to repeat what he had just said because he 
hadn't quite taken his meaning. Ford repeated it. 

"The wash?" said Arthur. 

"The space-time wash," said Ford, and as the wind blew briefly past 
at that moment, he bared his teeth into it. 

Arthur nodded, and then cleared his throat. 

"Are we talking about," he asked cautiously, "some sort of Vogon 
laundromat, or what are we talking about?" 

"Eddies," said Ford, "in the space-time continuum." 

"Ah," nodded Arthur, "is he? Is he?" He pushed his hands into the 
pocket of his dressing gown and looked knowledgeably into the 
distance. 

"What?" said Ford. 

"Er, who," said Arthur, "is Eddy, then, exactly?" 

Ford looked angrily at him. 

"Will you listen?" he snapped. 

"I have been listening," said Arthur, "but I'm not sure it's helped." 

Ford grasped him by the lapels of his dressing gown and spoke to 
him as slowly and distinctly and patiently as if he were somebody 
from a telephone company accounts department. 

"There seem..." he said, "to be some pools..." he said, "of 
instability..." he said, "in the fabric..." he said... 

Arthur looked foolishly at the cloth of his dressing gown where 
Ford was holding it. Ford swept on before Arthur could turn the 
foolish look into a foolish remark. 

"... in the fabric of space-time," he said. 

"Ah, that," said Arthur. 

"Yes, that," confirmed Ford. 

They stood there alone on a hill on prehistoric Earth and stared 
each other resolutely in the face. 

"And it's done what?" said Arthur. 

"It," said Ford, "has developed pools of instability." 



"Has it?" said Arthur, his eyes not wavering for a moment. 

"It has," said Ford with a similar degree of ocular immobility. 

"Good," said Arthur. 

"See?" said Ford. 

"No," said Arthur. 

There was a quiet pause. 

"The difficulty with this conversation," said Arthur after a sort of 
pondering look had crawled slowly across his face like a mountaineer 
negotiating a tricky outcrop, "is that it's very different from most of 
the ones I've had of late. Which, as I explained, have mostly been with 
trees. They weren't like this. Except perhaps some of the ones I've 
had with elms which sometimes get a bit bogged down." 

"Arthur," said Ford. 

"Hello? Yes?" said Arthur. 

"Just believe everything I tell you, and it will all be very, very 
simple." 

"Ah, well I'm not sure I believe that." 

They sat down and composed their thoughts. 

Ford got out his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It was making vague 
humming noises and a tiny light on it was flickering faintly. 

"Flat battery?" said Arthur. 

"No," said Ford, "there is a moving disturbance in the fabric of 
space-time, an eddy, a pool of instability, and it's somewhere in our 
vicinity." 

"Where?" 

Ford moved the device in a slow lightly bobbing semi-circle. 
Suddenly the light flashed. 

"There!" said Ford, shooting out his arm. "There, behind that sofa!" 

Arthur looked. Much to his surprise, there was a velvet paisley- 
covered Chesterfield sofa in the field in front of them. He boggled 
intelligently at it. Shrewd questions sprang into his mind. 

"Why," he said, "is there a sofa in that field?" 

"I told you!" shouted Ford, leaping to his feet. "Eddies in the space- 
time continuum!" 



"And this is his sofa, is it?" asked Arthur, struggling to his feet and, 
he hoped, though not very optimistically, to his senses. 

"Arthur!" shouted Ford at him, "that sofa is there because of the 
space-time instability I've been trying to get your terminally softened 
brain to get to grips with. It's been washed out of the continuum, it's 
space-time jetsam, it doesn't matter what it is, we've got to catch it, 
it's our only way out of here!" 

He scrambled rapidly down the rocky outcrop and made off across 
the field. 

"Catch it?" muttered Arthur, then frowned in bemusement as he 
saw that the Chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across 
the grass. 

With a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock 
and plunged off in hectic pursuit of Ford Prefect and the irrational 
piece of furniture. 

They careered wildly through the grass, leaping, laughing, shouting 
instructions to each other to head the thing off this way or that way. 
The sun shone dreamily on the swaying grass, tiny field animals 
scattered crazily in their wake. 

Arthur felt happy. He was terribly pleased that the day was for 
once working out so much according to plan. Only twenty minutes 
ago he had decided he would go mad, and now he was already 
chasing a Chesterfield sofa across the fields of prehistoric Earth. 

The sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to 
be as solid as the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as a 
billowing dream as it floated like a ghost through others. 

Ford and Arthur pounded chaotically after it, but it dodged and 
weaved as if following its own complex mathematical topography, 
which it was. Still they pursued, still it danced and span, and suddenly 
turned and dipped as if crossing the lip of a catastrophe graph, and 
they were practically on top of it. With a heave and a shout they leapt 
on it, the sun winked out, they fell through a sickening nothingness, 
and emerged unexpectedly in the middle of the pitch at Lord's Cricked 
Ground, St John's Wood, London, towards the end of the last Test 
Match of the Australian Series in the year 198-, with England needing 
only twenty-eight runs to win.

Chapter 3 


It was a charming and delightful day at Lord's as Ford and Arthur 
tumbled haphazardly out of a space-time anomaly and hit the 
immaculate turf rather hard. 

The applause of the crowd was tremendous. It wasn't for them, but 
instinctively they bowed anyway, which was fortunate because the 
small red heavy ball which the crowd actually had been applauding 
whistled mere millimetres over Arthur's head. In the crowd a man 
collapsed. 

They threw themselves back to the ground which seemed to spin 
hideously around them. 

"What was that?" hissed Arthur. 

"Something red," hissed Ford back at him. 

"Where are we?" 

"Er, somewhere green." 

"Shapes," muttered Arthur. "I need shapes." 

The applause of the crowd had been rapidly succeeded by gasps of 
astonishment, and the awkward titters of hundreds of people who 
could not yet make up their minds about whether to believe what 
they had just seen or not. 

"This your sofa?" said a voice. 

"What was that?" whispered Ford. 

Arthur looked up. 

"Something blue," he said. 

"Shape?" said Ford. 

Arthur looked again. 

"It is shaped," he hissed at Ford, with his brow savagely furrowing, 
"like a policeman." 



They remained crouched there for a few moments, frowning 
deeply. The blue thing shaped like a policeman tapped them both on 
the shoulders. 

"Come on, you two," the shape said, "let's be having you." 

These words had an electrifying effect on Arthur. He leapt to his 
feet like an author hearing the phone ring and shot a series of startled 
glanced at the panorama around him which had suddenly settled 
down into something of quite terrifying ordinariness. 

"Where did you get this from?" he yelled at the policeman shape. 

"What did you say?" said the startled shape. 

"This is Lord's Cricket Ground, isn't it?" snapped Arthur. "Where did 
you find it, how did you get it here? I think," he added, clasping his 
hand to his brow, "that I had better calm down." He squatted down 
abruptly in front of Ford. 

"It is a policeman," he said, "What do we do?" 

Ford shrugged. 

"What do you want to do?" he said. 

"I want you," said Arthur, "to tell me that I have been dreaming for 
the last five years." 

Ford shrugged again, and obliged. 

"You've been dreaming for the last five years," he said. 

Arthur got to his feet. 

"It's all right, officer," he said. "I've been dreaming for the last five 
years. Ask him," he added, pointing at Ford, "he was in it." 

Having said this, he sauntered off towards the edge of the pitch, 
brushing down his dressing gown. He then noticed his dressing gown 
and stopped. He stared at it. He flung himself at the policeman. 

"So where did I get these clothes from?" he howled. 

He collapsed and lay twitching on the grass. 

Ford shook his head. 

"He's had a bad two million years," he said to the policeman, and 
together they heaved Arthur on to the sofa and carried him off the 
pitch and were only briefly hampered by the sudden disappearance of 
the sofa on the way. 



Reaction to all this from the crowd were many and various. Most of 
them couldn't cope with watching it, and listened to it on the radio 
instead. 

"Well, this is an interesting incident, Brian," said one radio 
commentator to another. "I don't think there have been any 
mysterious materializations on the pitch since, oh since, well I don't 
think there have been any - have there? - that I recall?" 

"Edgbaston, 1932?" 

"Ah, now what happened then..." 

"Well, Peter, I think it was Canter facing Willcox coming up to bowl 
from the pavilion end when a spectator suddenly ran straight across 
the pitch." 

There was a pause while the first commentator considered this. 

"Ye... e... s..." he said, "yes, there's nothing actually very mysterious 
about that, is there? He didn't actually materialize, did he? Just ran 
on." 

"No, that's true, but he did claim to have seen something 
materialize on the pitch." 

"Ah, did he?" 

"Yes. An alligator, I think, of some description." 

"Ah. And had anyone else noticed it?" 

"Apparently not. And no one was able to get a very detailed 
description from him, so only the most perfunctory search was 
made." 

"And what happened to the man?" 

"Well, I think someone offered to take him off and give him some 
lunch, but he explained that he'd already had a rather good one, so 
the matter was dropped and Warwickshire went on to win by three 
wickets." 

"So, not very like this current instance. For those of you who've just 
tuned in, you may be interested to know that, er... two men, two 
rather scruffily attired men, and indeed a sofa - a Chesterfield I 
think?" 


"Yes, a Chesterfield." 



"Have just materialized here in the middle of Lord's Cricket Ground. 
But I don't think they meant any harm, they've been very good- 
natured about it, and..." 

"Sorry, can I interrupt you a moment Peter and say that the sofa 
has just vanished." 

"So it has. Well, that's one mystery less. Still, it's definitely one for 
the record books I think, particularly occurring at this dramatic 
moment in play, England now needing only twenty-four runs to win 
the series. The men are leaving the pitch in the company of a police 
officer, and I think everyone's settling down now and play is about to 
resume." 

"Now, sir," said the policeman after they had made a passage 
through the curious crowd and laid Arthur's peacefully inert body on a 
blanket, "perhaps you'd care to tell me who you are, where you come 
from, and what that little scene was all about?" 

Ford looked at the ground for a moment as if steadying himself for 
something, then he straightened up and aimed a look at the 
policeman which hit him with the full force of every inch of the six 
hundred light-years' distance between Earth and Ford's home near 
Betelgeuse. 

"All right," said Ford, very quietly, "I'll tell you." 

"Yes, well, that won't be necessary," said the policeman hurriedly, 
"just don't let whatever it was happen again." The policeman turned 
around and wandered off in search of anyone who wasn't from 
Betelgeuse. Fortunately, the ground was full of them. 

Arthur's consciousness approached his body as from a great 
distance, and reluctantly. It had had some bad times in there. Slowly, 
nervously, it entered and settled down in to its accustomed position. 

Arthur sat up. 

"Where am I?" he said. 

"Lord's Cricket Ground," said Ford. 

"Fine," said Arthur, and his consciousness stepped out again for a 
quick breather. His body flopped back on the grass. 

Ten minutes later, hunched over a cup of tea in the refreshment 
tent, the colour started to come back to his haggard face. 


"How're you feeling?" said Ford. 



"I'm home," said Arthur hoarsely. He closed his eyes and greedily 
inhaled the steam from his tea as if it was-well, as far as Arthur was 
concerned, as if it was tea, which it was. 

"I'm home," he repeated, "home. It's England, it's today, the 
nightmare is over." He opened his eyes again and smiled serenely. 

"I'm where I belong," he said in an emotional whisper. 

"There are two things I fell which I should tell you," said Ford, 
tossing a copy of the Guardian over the table at him. 

"I'm home," said Arthur. 

"Yes," said Ford. "One is," he said pointing at the date at the top of 
the paper, "that the Earth will be demolished in two days' time." 

"I'm home," said Arthur. "Tea," he said, "cricket," he added with 
pleasure, "mown grass, wooden benches, white linen jackets, beer 
cans..." 

Slowly he began to focus on the newspaper. He cocked his head on 
one side with a slight frown. 

"I've seen that one before," he said. His eyes wandered slowly up 
to the date, which Ford was idly tapping at. His face froze for a second 
or two and then began to do that terribly slow crashing trick which 
Arctic ice - floes do so spectacularly in the spring. 

"And the other thing," said Ford, "is that you appear to have a bone 
in your beard." He tossed back his tea. 

Outside the refreshment tent, the sun was shining on a happy 
crowd. It shone on white hats and red faces. It shone on ice lollies and 
melted them. It shone on the tears of small children whose ice lollies 
had just melted and fallen off the stick. It shone on the trees, it 
flashed off whirling cricket bats, it gleamed off the utterly 
extraordinary object which was parked behind the sight-screens and 
which nobody appeared to have noticed. It beamed on Ford and 
Arthur as they emerged blinking from the refreshment tent and 
surveyed the scene around them. 

Arthur was shaking. 

"Perhaps," he said, "I should..." 

"No," said Ford sharply. 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"Don't try and phone yourself up at home." 



"How did you know...?" 

Ford shrugged. 

"But why not?" said Arthur. 

"People who talk to themselves on the phone," said Ford, "never 
learn anything to their advantage." 

"But..." 

"Look," said Ford. He picked up an imaginary phone and dialled an 
imaginary dial. 

"Hello?" he said into the imaginary mouthpiece. "Is that Arthur 
Dent? Ah, hello, yes. This is Arthur Dent speaking. Don't hang up." 

He looked at the imaginary mouthpiece in disappointment. 

"He hung up," he said, shrugged, and put the imaginary phone 
neatly back on its imaginary hook. 

"This is not my first temporal anomaly," he added. 

A glummer look replaced the already glum look on Arthur Dent's 
face. 

"So we're not home and dry," he said. 

"We could not even be said," replied Ford, "to be home and 
vigorously towelling ourselves off." 

The game continued. The bowler approached the wicket at a lope, 
a trot, and then a run. He suddenly exploded in a flurry of arms and 
legs, out of which flew a ball. The batsman swung and thwacked it 
behind him over the sight-screens. Ford's eyes followed the trajectory 
of the ball and jogged momentarily. He stiffened. He looked along the 
flight path of the ball again and his eyes twitched again. 

"This isn't my towel," said Arthur, who was rummaging in his 
rabbit-skin bag. 

"Shhh," said Ford. He screwed his eyes up in concentration. 

"I had a Golgafrinchan jogging towel," continued Arthur, "it was 
blue with yellow stars on it. This isn't it." 

"Shhh," said Ford again. He covered one eye and looked with the 
other. 

"This one's pink," said Arthur, "it isn't yours is it?" 

"I would like you to shut up about your towel," said Ford. 

"It isn't my towel," insisted Arthur, "that is the point I am trying 



"And the time at which I would like you to shut up about it," 
continued Ford in a low growl, "is now." 

"All right," said Arthur, starting to stuff it back into the primitively 
stitched rabbit-skin bag. "I realize that it is probably not important in 
the cosmic scale of things, it's just odd, that's all. A pink towel 
suddenly, instead of a blue one with yellow stars." 

Ford was beginning to behave rather strangely, or rather not 
actually beginning to behave strangely but beginning to behave in a 
way which was strangely different from the other strange ways in 
which he more regularly behaved. What he was doing was this. 
Regardless of the bemused stares it was provoking from his fellow 
members of the crowd gathered round the pitch, he was waving his 
hands in sharp movements across his face, ducking down behind 
some people, leaping up behind others, then standing still and 
blinking a lot. After a moment or two of this he started to stalk 
forward slowly and stealthily wearing a puzzled frown of 
concentration, like a leopard that's not sure whether it's just seen a 
half-empty tin of cat food half a mile away across a hot and dusty 
plain. 

"This isn't my bag either," said Arthur suddenly. 

Ford's spell of concentration was broken. Fie turned angrily on 
Arthur. 

"I wasn't talking about my towel," said Arthur. "We've established 
that that isn't mine. It's just that the bag into which I was putting the 
towel which is not mine is also not mine, though it is extraordinarily 
similar. Now personally I think that that is extremely odd, especially 
as the bag was one I made myself on prehistoric Earth. These are also 
not my stones," he added, pulling a few flat grey stones out of the bag. 
"I was making a collection of interesting stones and these are clearly 
very dull ones." 

A roar of excitement thrilled through the crowd and obliterated 
whatever it was that Ford said in reply to this piece of information. 

The cricket ball which had excited this reaction fell out of the sky and 
dropped neatly into Arthur's mysterious rabbit-skin bag. 

"Now I would say that that was also a very curious event," said 
Arthur, rapidly closing the bag and pretending to look for the ball on 
the ground. 



"I don't think it's here," he said to the small boys who immediately 
clustered round him to join in the search, "it probably rolled off 
somewhere. Over there I expect." He pointed vaguely in the direction 
in which he wished they would push off. One of the boys looked at 
him quizzically. 

"You all right?" said the boy. 

"No," said Arthur. 

"Then why you got a bone in your beard?" said the boy. 

"I'm training it to like being wherever it's put." Arthur prided 
himself on saying this. It was, he thought, exactly the sort of thing 
which would entertain and stimulate young minds. 

"Oh," said the small boy, putting his head to one side and thinking 
about it. "What's your name?" 

"Dent," said Arthur, "Arthur Dent." 

"You're a jerk. Dent," said the boy, "a complete asshole." The boy 
looked past him at something else, to show that he wasn't in any 
particular hurry to run away, and then wandered off scratching his 
nose. Suddenly Arthur remembered that the Earth was going to be 
demolished again in two days' time, and just this once didn't feel too 
bad about it. 

Play resumed with a new ball, the sun continued to shine and Ford 
continued to jump up and down shaking his head and blinking. 

"Something's on your mind, isn't it?" said Arthur. 

"I think," said Ford in a tone of voice which Arthur by now 
recognized as one which presaged something utterly unintelligible, 
"that there's an SEP over there." 

He pointed. Curiously enough, the direction he pointed in was not 
the one in which he was looking. Arthur looked in the one direction, 
which was towards the sight-screens, and in the other which was at 
the field of play. He nodded, he shrugged. He shrugged again. 

"A what?" he said. 

"An SEP." 

"AnS...?" 

"... EP." 

"And what's that?" 


"Somebody Else's Problem." 



"Ah, good," said Arthur and relaxed. He had no idea what all that 
was about, but at least it seemed to be over. It wasn't. 

"Over there," said Ford, again pointing at the sight-screens and 
looking at the pitch. 

"Where?" said Arthur. 

"There!" said Ford. 

"I see," said Arthur, who didn't. 

"You do?" said Ford. 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"Can you see," said Ford patiently, "the SEP?" 

"I thought you said that was somebody else's problem." 

"That's right." 

Arthur nodded slowly, carefully and with an air of immense 
stupidity. 

"And I want to know," said Ford, "if you can see it." 

"You do?" 

"Yes." 

"What," said Arthur, "does it look like?" 

"Well, how should I know, you fool?" shouted Ford. "If you can see 
it, you tell me." 

Arthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind the 
temples which was a hallmark of so many of his conversations with 
Ford. His brain lurked like a frightened puppy in its kennel. Ford took 
him by the arm. 

"An SEP," he said, "is something that we can't see, or don't see, or 
our brain doesn't let us see, because we think that it's somebody 
else's problem. That's what SEP means. Somebody Else's Problem. 

The brain just edits it out, it's like a blind spot. If you look at it directly 
you won't see it unless you know precisely what it is. Your only hope 
is to catch it by surprise out of the corner of your eye." 

"Ah," said Arthur, "then that's why..." 

"Yes," said Ford, who knew what Arthur was going to say. 

"... you've been jumping up and..." 

"Yes." 


"... down, and blinking..." 



"Yes." 

"...and..." 

"I think you've got the message." 

"I can see it," said Arthur, "it's a spaceship." 

For a moment Arthur was stunned by the reaction this revelation 
provoked. A roar erupted from the crowd, and from every direction 
people were running, shouting, yelling, tumbling over each other in a 
tumult of confusion. He stumbled back in astonishment and glanced 
fearfully around. Then he glanced around again in even greater 
astonishment. 

"Exciting, isn't it?" said an apparition. The apparition wobbled in 
front of Arthur's eyes, though the truth of the matter is probably that 
Arthur's eyes were wobbling in front of the apparition. His mouth 
wobbled as well. 

"W... w... w... w..." his mouth said. 

"I think your team have just won," said the apparition. 

"W... w... w... w..." repeated Arthur, and punctuated each wobble 
with a prod at Ford Prefect's back. Ford was staring at the tumult in 
trepidation. 

"You are English, aren't you?" said the apparition. 

"W... w... w... w... yes" said Arthur. 

"Well, your team, as I say, have just won. The match. It means they 
retain the Ashes. You must be very pleased. I must say, I'm rather 
fond of cricket, though I wouldn't like anyone outside this planet to 
hear me saying that. Oh dear no." 

The apparition gave what looked as if it might have been a 
mischievous grin, but it was hard to tell because the sun was directly 
behind him, creating a blinding halo round his head and illuminating 
his silver hair and beard in a way which was awesome, dramatic and 
hard to reconcile with mischievous grins. 

"Still," he said, "it'll all be over in a couple of days, won't it? Though 
as I said to you when we last met, I was very sorry about that. Still, 
whatever will have been, will have been." 

Arthur tried to speak, but gave up the unequal struggle. He 
prodded Ford again. 



"I thought something terrible had happened," said Ford, "but it's 
just the end of the game. We ought to get out. Oh, hello, 

Slartibartfast, what are you doing here?" 

"Oh, pottering, pottering," said the old man gravely. 

"That your ship? Can you give us a lift anywhere?" 

"Patience, patience," the old man admonished. 

"OK," said Ford. "It's just that this planet's going to be demolished 
pretty soon." 

"I know that," said Slartibartfast. 

"And, well, I just wanted to make that point," said Ford. 

"The point is taken." 

And if you feel that you really want to hang around a cricket pitch 
at this point..." 

"I do." 

"Then it's your ship." 

"It is." 

"I suppose." Ford turned away sharply at this point. 

"Flello, Slartibartfast," said Arthur at last. 

"Hello, Earthman," said Slartibartfast. 

"After all," said Ford, "we can only die once." 

The old man ignored this and stared keenly on to the pitch, with 
eyes that seemed alive with expressions that had no apparent bearing 
on what was happening out there. What was happening was that the 
crowd was gathering itself into a wide circle round the centre of the 
pitch. What Slartibartfast saw in it, he alone knew. 

Ford was humming something. It was just one note repeated at 
intervals. He was hoping that somebody would ask him what he was 
humming, but nobody did. If anybody had asked him he would have 
said he was humming the first line of a Noel Coward song called "Mad 
About the Boy" over and over again. It would then have been pointed 
out to him that he was only singing one note, to which he would have 
replied that for reasons which he hoped would be apparent, he was 
omitting the "about the boy" bit. Fie was annoyed that nobody asked. 

"It's just," he burst out at last, "that if we don't go soon, we might 
get caught in the middle of it all again. And there's nothing that 
depresses me more than seeing a planet being destroyed. Except 



possibly still being on it when it happens. Or," he added in an 
undertone, "hanging around cricket matches." 

"Patience," said Slartibartfast again. "Great things are afoot." 

"That's what you said last time we met," said Arthur. 

"They were," said Slartibartfast. 

"Yes, that's true," admitted Arthur. 

All, however, that seemed to be afoot was a ceremony of some 
kind. It was being specially staged for the benefit of tv rather than the 
spectators, and all they could gather about it from where they were 
standing was what they heard from a nearby radio. Ford was 
aggressively uninterested. 

He fretted as he heard it explained that the Ashes were about to be 
presented to the Captain of the English team out there on the pitch, 
fumed when told that this was because they had now won them for 
the nth time, positively barked with annoyance at the information 
that the Ashes were the remains of a cricket stump, and when, 
further to this, he was asked to contend with the fact that the cricket 
stump in question had been burnt in Melbourne, Australia, in 1882, to 
signify the "death of English cricket", he rounded on Slartibartfast, 
took a deep breath, but didn't have a chance to say anything because 
the old man wasn't there. He was marching out on to the pitch with 
terrible purpose in his gait, his hair, beard and robes swept behind 
him, looking very much as Moses would have looked if Sinai had been 
a well-cut lawn instead of, as it is more usually represented, a fiery 
smoking mountain. 

"He said to meet him at his ship," said Arthur. 

"What in the name of zarking fardwarks is the old fool doing?" 
exploded Ford. 

"Meeting us at his ship in two minutes," said Arthur with a shrug 
which indicated total abdication of thought. They started off towards 
it. Strange sounds reached their ears. They tried not to listen, but 
could not help noticing that Slartibartfast was querulously demanding 
that he be given the silver urn containing the Ashes, as they were, he 
said, "vitally important for the past, present and future safety of the 
Galaxy", and that this was causing wild hilarity. They resolved to 
ignore it. 



What happened next they could not ignore. With a noise like a 
hundred thousand people saying "wop", a steely white spaceship 
suddenly seemed to create itself out of nothing in the air directly 
above the cricket pitch and hung there with infinite menace and a 
slight hum. 

Then for a while it did nothing, as if it expected everybody to go 
about their normal business and not mind it just hanging there. 

Then it did something quite extraordinary. Or rather, it opened up 
and let something quite extraordinary come out of it, eleven quite 
extraordinary things. 

They were robots, white robots. 

What was most extraordinary about them was that they appeared 
to have come dressed for the occasion. Not only were they white, but 
they carried what appeared to be cricket bats, and not only that, but 
they also carried what appeared to be cricket balls, and not only that 
but they wore white ribbing pads round the lower parts of their legs. 
These last were extraordinary because they appeared to contain jets 
which allowed these curiously civilized robots to fly down from their 
hovering spaceship and start to kill people, which is what they did 

"Hello," said Arthur, "something seems to be happening." 

"Get to the ship," shouted Ford. "I don't want to know, I don't want 
to see, I don't want to hear," he yelled as he ran, "this is not my 
planet, I didn't choose to be here, I don't want to get involved, just 
get me out of here, and get me to a party, with people I can relate 
to!" 

Smoke and flame billowed from the pitch. 

"Well, the supernatural brigade certainly seems to be out in force 
here today..." burbled a radio happily to itself. 

"What I need," shouted Ford, by way of clarifying his previous 
remarks, "is a strong drink and a peer-group." He continued to run, 
pausing only for a moment to grab Arthur's arm and drag him along 
with him. Arthur had adopted his normal crisis role, which was to 
stand with his mouth hanging open and let it all wash over him. 

"They're playing cricket," muttered Arthur, stumbling along after 
Ford. "I swear they are playing cricket. I do not know why they are 
doing this, but that is what they are doing. They're not just killing 



people, they're sending them up," he shouted, "Ford, they're sending 
us up!" 

It would have been hard to disbelieve this without knowing a great 
deal more Galactic history than Arthur had so far managed to pick up 
in his travels. The ghostly but violent shapes that could be seen 
moving within the thick pall of smoke seemed to be performing a 
series of bizarre parodies of batting strokes, the difference being that 
every ball they struck with their bats exploded wherever it landed. 

The very first one of these had dispelled Arthur's initial reaction, that 
the whole thing might just be a publicity stunt by Australian 
margarine manufacturers. 

And then, as suddenly as it had all started, it was over. The eleven 
white robots ascended through the seething cloud in a tight 
formation, and with a few last flashes of flame entered the bowels of 
their hovering white ship, which, with the noise of a hundred 
thousand people saying "foop", promptly vanished into the thin air 
out of which it had wopped. 

For a moment there was a terrible stunned silence, and then out of 
the drifting smoke emerged the pale figure of Slartibartfast looking 
even more like Moses because in spite of the continued absence of 
the mountain he was at least now striding across a fiery and smoking 
well-mown lawn. 

Fie stared wildly about him until he saw the hurrying figures of 
Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect forcing their way through the frightened 
crowd which was for the moment busy stampeding in the opposite 
direction. The crowd was clearly thinking to itself about what an 
unusual day this was turning out to be, and not really knowing which 
way, if any, to turn. 

Slartibartfast was gesturing urgently at Ford and Arthur and 
shouting at them, as the three of them gradually converged on his 
ship, still parked behind the sight-screens and still apparently 
unnoticed by the crowd stampeding past it who presumably had 
enough of their own problems to cope with at that time. 

"They've garble warble farble!" shouted Slartibartfast in his thin 
tremulous voice. 

"What did he say?" panted Ford as he elbowed his way onwards. 

Arthur shook his head. 



"'They've...' something or other," he said. 

"They've table warble farble!" shouted Slartibartfast again. 

Ford and Arthur shook their heads at each other. 

"It sounds urgent," said Arthur. He stopped and shouted. 

"What?" 

"They've garble warble fashes!" cried Slartibartfast, still waving at 
them. 

"He says," said Arthur, "that they've taken the Ashes. That is what I 
think he says." They ran on. 

"The...?" said Ford. 

"Ashes," said Arthur tersely. "The burnt remains of a cricket stump. 
It's a trophy. That..." he was panting, "is... apparently... what they... 
have come and taken." He shook his head very slightly as if he was 
trying to get his brain to settle down lower in his skull. 

"Strange thing to want to tell us," snapped Ford. 

"Strange thing to take." 

"Strange ship." 

They had arrived at it. The second strangest thing about the ship 
was watching the Somebody Else's Problem field at work. They could 
now clearly see the ship for what it was simply because they knew it 
was there. It was quite apparent, however, that nobody else could. 
This wasn't because it was actually invisible or anything hyper¬ 
impossible like that. The technology involved in making anything 
invisible is so infinitely complex that nine hundred and ninety-nine 
thousand million, nine hundred and ninety-nine million, nine hundred 
and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine times out of 
a billion it is much simpler and more effective just to take the thing 
away and do without it. The ultra-famous sciento-magician Effrafax of 
Wug once bet his life that, given a year, he could render the great 
megamountain Magramal entirely invisible. 

Having spent most of the year jiggling around with immense Lux-O- 
Valves and Refracto-Nullifiers and Spectrum-Bypass-O-Matics, he 
realized, with nine hours to go, that he wasn't going to make it. 

So, he and his friends, and his friends' friends, and his friends' 
friends' friends, and his friends' friends' friends' friends, and some 
rather less good friends of theirs who happened to own a major 
stellar trucking company, put in what now is widely recognized as 



being the hardest night's work in history, and, sure enough, on the 
following day, Magramal was no longer visible. Effrafax lost his bet - 
and therefore his life - simply because some pedantic adjudicating 
official noticed (a) that when walking around the area that Magramal 
ought to be he didn't trip over or break his nose on anything, and (b) 
a suspicious-looking extra moon. 

The Somebody Else's Problem field is much simpler and more 
effective, and what's more can be run for over a hundred years on a 
single torch battery. This is because it relies on people's natural 
disposition not to see anything they don't want to, weren't expecting, 
or can't explain. If Effrafax had painted the mountain pink and erected 
a cheap and simple Somebody Else's Problem field on it, then people 
would have walked past the mountain, round it, even over it, and 
simply never have noticed that the thing was there. 

And this is precisely what was happening with Slartibartfast's ship. 

It wasn't pink, but if it had been, that would have been the least of its 
visual problems and people were simply ignoring it like anything. 

The most extraordinary thing about it was that it looked only partly 
like a spaceship with guidance fins, rocket engines and escape 
hatches and so on, and a great deal like a small upended Italian bistro. 

Ford and Arthur gazed up at it with wonderment and deeply 
offended sensibilities. 

"Yes, I know," said Slartibartfast, hurrying up to them at that point, 
breathless and agitated, "but there is a reason. Come, we must go. 
The ancient nightmare is come again. Doom confronts us all. We must 
leave at once." 

"I fancy somewhere sunny," said Ford. 

Ford and Arthur followed Slartibartfast into the ship and were so 
perplexed by what they saw inside it that they were totally unaware 
of what happened next outside. 

A spaceship, yet another one, but this one sleek and silver, 
descended from the sky on to the pitch, quietly, without fuss, its long 
legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology. 

It landed gently. It extended a short ramp. A tall grey-green figure 
marched briskly out and approached the small knot of people who 
were gathered in the centre of the pitch tending to the casualties of 
the recent bizarre massacre. It moved people aside with quiet. 



understated authority, and came at last to a man lying in a desperate 
pool of blood, clearly now beyond the reach of any Earthly medicine, 
breathing, coughing his last. The figure knelt down quietly beside him. 

"Arthur Philip Deodat?" asked the figure. 

The man, with horrified confusion in eyes, nodded feebly. 

"You're a no-good dumbo nothing," whispered the creature. "I 
thought you should know that before you went." 


Important facts from Galactic history, number two: 

(Reproduced from the Siderial Daily Mentioner's Book of popular 
Galactic History.) 

Since this Galaxy began, vast civilizations have risen and fallen, 
risen and fallen, risen and fallen so often that it's quite tempting to 
think that life in the Galaxy must be: 

(a) something akin to seasick - space-sick, time sick, history sick or 
some such thing, and 

(b) stupid. 



Chapter 4 


It seemed to Arthur as if the whole sky suddenly just stood aside 
and let them through. 

It seemed to him that the atoms of his brain and the atoms of the 
cosmos were streaming through each other. 

It seemed to him that he was blown on the wind of the Universe, 
and that the wind was him. 

It seemed to him that he was one of the thoughts of the Universe 
and that the Universe was a thought of his. 

It seemed to the people at Lord's Cricket Ground that another 
North London restaurant had just come and gone as they so often do, 
and that this was Somebody Else's Problem. 

"What happened?" whispered Arthur in considerable awe. 

"We took off," said Slartibartfast. 

Arthur lay in startled stillness on the acceleration couch. He wasn't 
certain whether he had just got space-sickness or religion. 

"Nice mover," said Ford in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise the 
degree to which he had been impressed by what Slartibartfast's ship 
had just done, "shame about the decor." 

For a moment or two the old man didn't reply. He was staring at 
the instruments with the air of one who is trying to convert 
fahrenheit to centigrade in his head whilst his house is burning down. 
Then his brow cleared and he stared for a moment at the wide 
panoramic screen in front of him, which displayed a bewildering 
complexity of stars streaming like silver threads around them. 

His lips moved as if he was trying to spell something. Suddenly his 
eyes darted in alarm back to his instruments, but then his expression 
merely subsided into a steady frown. He looked back up at the screen. 
He felt his own pulse. His frown deepened for a moment, then he 
relaxed. 



"It's a mistake to try and understand mathematics," he said, "they 
only worry me. What did you say?" 

"Decor," said Ford. "Pity about it." 

"Deep in the fundamental heart of mind and Universe," said 
Slartibartfast, "there is a reason." 

Ford glanced sharply around. Fie clearly thought this was taking an 
optimistic view of things. 

The interior of the flight deck was dark green, dark red, dark brown, 
cramped and moodily lit. Inexplicably, the resemblance to a small 
Italian bistro had failed to end at the hatchway. Small pools of light 
picked out pot plants, glazed tiles and all sorts of little unidentifiable 
brass things. 

Rafia-wrapped bottles lurked hideously in the shadows. 

The instruments which had occupied Slartibartfast's attention 
seemed to be mounted in the bottom of bottles which were set in 
concrete. 

Ford reached out and touched it. 

Fake concrete. Plastic. Fake bottles set in fake concrete. 

The fundamental heart of mind and Universe can take a running 
jump, he thought to himself, this is rubbish. On the other hand, it 
could not be denied that the way the ship had moved made the Fleart 
of Gold seem like an electric pram. 

Fie swung himself off the couch. Fie brushed himself down. Fie 
looked at Arthur who was singing quietly to himself. Fie looked at the 
screen and recognized nothing. Fie looked at Slartibartfast. 

"Flow far did we just travel?" he said. 

"About..." said Slartibartfast, "about two thirds of the way across 
the Galactic disc, I would say, roughly. Yes, roughly two thirds, I 
think." 

"It's a strange thing," said Arthur quietly, "that the further and 
faster one travels across the Universe, the more one's position in it 
seems to be largely immaterial, and one is filled with a profound, or 
rather emptied of a..." 

"Yes, very strange," said Ford. "Where are we going?" 

"We are going," said Slartibartfast, "to confront an ancient 
nightmare of the Universe." 



"And where are you going to drop us off?" 

"I will need your help." 

"Tough. Look, there's somewhere you can take us where we can 
have fun. I'm trying to think of it, we can get drunk and maybe listen 
to some extremely evil music. Hold on. I'll look it up." He dug out his 
copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and tipped through 
those parts of the index primarily concerned with sex and drugs and 
rock and roll. 

"A curse has arisen from the mists of time," said Slartibartfast. 

"Yes, I expect so," said Ford. "Hey," he said, lighting accidentally on 
one particular reference entry, "Eccentrica Gallumbits, did you ever 
meet her? The triple-breasted whore of Eroticon Six. Some people say 
her erogenous zones start some four miles from her actual body. Me, 

I disagree, I say five." 

"A curse," said Slartibartfast, "which will engulf the Galaxy in fire 
and destruction, and possibly bring the Universe to a premature 
doom. I mean it," he added. 

"Sounds like a bad time," said Ford, "with luck I'll be drunk enough 
not to notice. Here," he said, stabbing his finger at the screen of the 
Guide, "would be a really wicked place to go, and I think we should. 
What do you say, Arthur? Stop mumbling mantras and pay attention. 
There's important stuff you're missing here." 

Arthur pushed himself up from his couch and shook his head. 

"Where are we going?" he said. 

"To confront an ancient night - " 

"Can it," said Ford. "Arthur, we are going out into the Galaxy to 
have some fun. Is that an idea you can cope with?" 

"What's Slartibartfast looking so anxious about?" said Arthur. 

"Nothing," said Ford. 

"Doom," said Slartibartfast. "Come," he added, with sudden 
authority, "there is much I must show and tell you." 

He walked towards a green wrought-iron spiral staircase set 
incomprehensibly in the middle of the flight deck and started to 
ascend. Arthur, with a frown, followed. 

Ford slung the Guide sullenly back into his satchel. 



"My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland and a 
natural deficiency in moral fibre," he muttered to himself, "and that I 
am therefore excused from saving Universes." 

Nevertheless, he stomped up the stairs behind them. 

What they found upstairs was just stupid, or so it seemed, and Ford 
shook his head, buried his face in his hands and slumped against a pot 
plant, crushing it against the wall. 

"The central computational area," said Slartibartfast unperturbed, 
"this is where every calculation affecting the ship in any way is 
performed. Yes I know what it looks like, but it is in fact a complex 
four-dimensional topographical map of a series of highly complex 
mathematical functions." 

"It looks like a joke," said Arthur. 

"I know what it looks like," said Slartibartfast, and went into it. As 
he did so, Arthur had a sudden vague flash of what it might mean, but 
he refused to believe it. The Universe could not possibly work like that, 
he thought, cannot possibly. That, he thought to himself, would be as 
absurd as... he terminated that line of thinking. Most of the really 
absurd things he could think of had already happened. 

And this was one of them. 

It was a large glass cage, or box-in fact a room. 

In it was a table, a long one. Around it were gathered about a 
dozen chairs, of the bentwood style. On it was a tablecloth - a grubby, 
red and white check tablecloth, scarred with the occasional cigarette 
burn, each, presumably, at a precise calculated mathematical position. 

And on the tablecloth sat some half-eaten Italian meals, hedged 
about with half-eaten breadsticks and half-drunk glasses of wine, and 
toyed with listlessly by robots. 

It was all completely artificial. The robot customers were attended 
by a robot waiter, a robot wine waiter and a robot maetre d'. The 
furniture was artificial, the tablecloth artificial, and each particular 
piece of food was clearly capable of exhibiting all the mechanical 
characteristics of, say, a polio sorpreso, without actually being one. 

And all participated in a little dance together - a complex routine 
involving the manipulation of menus, bill pads, wallets, cheque books, 
credit cards, watches, pencils and paper napkins, which seemed to be 



hovering constantly on the edge of violence, but never actually 
getting anywhere. 

Slartibartfast hurried in, and then appeared to pass the time of day 
quite idly with the maetre d', whilst one of the customer robots, an 
autorory, slid slowly under the table, mentioning what he intended to 
do to some guy over some girl. 

Slartibartfast took over the seat which had been thus vacated and 
passed a shrewd eye over the menu. The tempo of the routine round 
the table seemed somehow imperceptibly to quicken. Arguments 
broke out, people attempted to prove things on napkins. They waved 
fiercely at each other, and attempted to examine each other's pieces 
of chicken. The waiter's hand began to move on the bill pad more 
quickly than a human hand could manage, and then more quickly 
than a human eye could follow. The pace accelerated. Soon, an 
extraordinary and insistent politeness overwhelmed the group, and 
seconds later it seemed that a moment of consensus was suddenly 
achieved. A new vibration thrilled through the ship. 

Slartibartfast emerged from the glass room. 

"Bistromathics," he said. "The most powerful computational force 
known to parascience. Come to the Room of Informational Illusions." 

He swept past and carried them bewildered in his wake. 



Chapter 5 


The Bistromatic Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast 
interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about with 
Improbability Factors. 

Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of 
understanding the behaviour of numbers. Just as Einstein observed 
that time was not an absolute but depended on the observer's 
movement in space, and that space was not an absolute, but 
depended on the observer's movement in time, so it is now realized 
that numbers are not absolute, but depend on the observer's 
movement in restaurants. 

The first non-absolute number is the number of people for whom 
the table is reserved. This will vary during the course of the first three 
telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent relation 
to the number of people who actually turn up, or to the number of 
people who subsequently join them after the show/match/party/gig, 
or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has 
turned up. 

The second non-absolute number is the given time of arrival, which 
is now known to be one of those most bizarre of mathematical 
concepts, a recipriversexcluson, a number whose existence can only 
be defined as being anything other than itself. In other words, the 
given time of arrival is the one moment of time at which it is 
impossible that any member of the party will arrive. 
Recipriversexclusons now play a vital part in many branches of maths, 
including statistics and accountancy and also form the basic equations 
used to engineer the Somebody Else's Problem field. 

The third and most mysterious piece of non-absoluteness of all lies 
in the relationship between the number of items on the bill, the cost 
of each item, the number of people at the table, and what they are 
each prepared to pay for. (The number of people who have actually 
brought any money is only a sub-phenomenon in this field.) 



The baffling discrepancies which used to occur at this point 
remained uninvestigated for centuries simply because no one took 
them seriously. They were at the time put down to such things as 
politeness, rudeness, meanness, flashness, tiredness, emotionality, or 
the lateness of the hour, and completely forgotten about on the 
following morning. They were never tested under laboratory 
conditions, of course, because they never occurred in laboratories - 
not in reputable laboratories at least. 

And so it was only with the advent of pocket computers that the 
startling truth became finally apparent, and it was this: 

Numbers written on restaurant bills within the confines of 
restaurants do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers 
written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the 
Universe. 

This single fact took the scientific world by storm. It completely 
revolutionized it. So many mathematical conferences got held in such 
good restaurants that many of the finest minds of a generation died 
of obesity and heart failure and the science of maths was put back by 
years. 

Slowly, however, the implications of the idea began to be 
understood. To begin with it had been too stark, too crazy, too much 
what the man in the street would have said, "Oh yes, I could have told 
you that," about. Then some phrases like "Interactive Subjectivity 
Frameworks" were invented, and everybody was able to relax and get 
on with it. 

The small groups of monks who had taken up hanging around the 
major research institutes singing strange chants to the effect that the 
Universe was only a figment of its own imagination were eventually 
given a street theatre grant and went away. 



Chapter 6 


"In space travel, you see," said Slartibartfast, as he fiddled with 
some instruments in the Room of Informational Illusions, "in space 
travel..." 

He stopped and looked about him. 

The Room of Informational Illusions was a welcome relief after the 
visual monstrosities of the central computational area. There was 
nothing in it. No information, no illusions, just themselves, white walls 
and a few small instruments which looked as if they were meant to 
plug into something which Slartibartfast couldn't find. 

"Yes?" urged Arthur. He had picked up Slartibartfast's sense of 
urgency but didn't know what to do with it. 

"Yes what?" said the old man. 

"You were saying?" 

Slartibartfast looked at him sharply. 

"The numbers," he said, "are awful." He resumed his search. 

Arthur nodded wisely to himself. After a while he realized that this 
wasn't getting him anywhere and decided that he would say "what?" 
after all. 

"In space travel," repeated Slartibartfast, "all the numbers are 
awful." 

Arthur nodded again and looked round to Ford for help, but Ford 
was practising being sullen and getting quite good at it. 

"I was only," said Slartibartfast with a sigh, "trying to save you the 
trouble of asking me why all the ship's computations were being done 
on a waiter's bill pad." 

Arthur frowned. 

"Why," he said, "were all the ship's computations being done on a 
wait-" 

He stopped. 



Slartibartfast said, "Because in space travel all the numbers are 
awful." 

He could tell that he wasn't getting his point across. 

"Listen," he said. "On a waiter's bill pad numbers dance. You must 
have encountered the phenomenon." 

"Well..." 

"On a waiter's bill pad," said Slartibartfast, "reality and unreality 
collide on such a fundamental level that each becomes the other and 
anything is possible, within certain parameters." 

"What parameters?" 

"It's impossible to say," said Slartibartfast. "That's one of them. 
Strange but true. At least, I think it's strange," he added, "and I'm 
assured that it's true." 

At that moment he located the slot in the wall for which he had 
been searching, and clicked the instrument he was holding into it. 

"Do not be alarmed," he said, and then suddenly darted an 
alarmed look at himself, and lunged back, "it's..." 

They didn't hear what he said, because at that moment the ship 
winked out of existence around them and a starbattle-ship the size of 
a small Midlands industrial city plunged out of the sundered night 
towards them, star lasers ablaze. 

They gaped, pop-eyed, and were unable to scream. 



Chapter 7 


Another world, another day, another dawn. 

The early morning's thinnest sliver of light appeared silently. 

Several billion trillion tons of superhot exploding hydrogen nuclei 
rose slowly above the horizon and managed to look small, cold and 
slightly damp. 

There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there is the 
possibility of magic. Creation holds its breath. 

The moment passed as it regularly did on Squornshellous Zeta, 
without incident. 

The mist clung to the surface of the marshes. The swamp trees 
were grey with it, the tall reeds indistinct. It hung motionless like held 
breath. 

Nothing moved. 

There was silence. 

The sun struggled feebly with the mist, tried to impart a little 
warmth here, shed a little light there, but clearly today was going to 
be just another long haul across the sky. 

Nothing moved. 

Again, silence. 

Nothing moved. 

Silence. 

Very often on Squornshellous Zeta, whole days would go on like 
this, and this was indeed going to be one of them. 

Fourteen hours later the sun sank hopelessly beneath the opposite 
horizon with a sense of totally wasted effort. 

And a few hours later it reappeared, squared its shoulders and 
started on up the sky again. 

This time, however, something was happening. A mattress had just 
met a robot. 



"Hello, robot," said the mattress. 

"Bleah," said the robot and continued what it was doing, which was 
walking round very slowly in a very tiny circle. 

"Happy?" said the mattress. 

The robot stopped and looked at the mattress. It looked at it 
quizzically. It was clearly a very stupid mattress. It looked back at him 
with wide eyes. 

After what it had calculated to ten significant decimal places as 
being the precise length of pause most likely to convey a general 
contempt for all things mattressy, the robot continued to walk round 
in tight circles. 

"We could have a conversation," said the mattress, "would you like 
that?" 

It was a large mattress, and probably one of quite high quality. 

Very few things actually get manufactured these days, because in an 
infinitely large Universe such as, for instance, the one in which we live, 
most things one could possibly imagine, and a lot of things one would 
rather not, grow somewhere. A forest was discovered recently in 
which most of the trees grew ratchet screwdrivers as fruit. The life 
cycle of ratchet screwdriver fruit it quite interesting. Once picked it 
needs a dark dusty drawer in which it can lie undisturbed for years. 
Then one night it suddenly hatches, discards its outer skin which 
crumbles into dust, and emerges as a totally unidentifiable little metal 
object with flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a sort of hole 
for a screw. This, when found, will get thrown away. No one knows 
what it is supposed to gain from this. Nature, in her infinite wisdom, is 
presumably working on it. 

No one really knows what mattresses are meant to gain from their 
lives either. They are large, friendly, pocket-sprung creatures which 
live quiet private lives in the marshes of Squornshellous Zeta. Many of 
them get caught, slaughtered, dried out, shipped out and slept on. 
None of them seem to mind and all of them are called Zem. 

"No," said Marvin. 

"My name," said the mattress, "is Zem. We could discuss the 
weather a little." 

Marvin paused again in his weary circular plod. 



"The dew," he observed, "has clearly fallen with a particularly 
sickening thud this morning." 

He resumed his walk, as if inspired by this conversational outburst 
to fresh heights of gloom and despondency. He plodded tenaciously. 

If he had had teeth he would have gritted them at this point. He 
hadn't. He didn't. The mere plod said it all. 

The mattress flolloped around. This is a thing that only live 
mattresses in swamps are able to do, which is why the word is not in 
more common usage. It flolloped in a sympathetic sort of way, 
moving a fairish body of water as it did so. It blew a few bubbles up 
through the water engagingly. Its blue and white stripes glistened 
briefly in a sudden feeble ray of sun that had unexpectedly made it 
through the mist, causing the creature to bask momentarily. 

Marvin plodded. 

"You have something on your mind, I think," said the mattress 
floopily. 

"More than you can possibly imagine," dreaded Marvin. "My 
capacity for mental activity of all kinds is as boundless as the infinite 
reaches of space itself. Except of course for my capacity for 
happiness." 

Stomp, stomp, he went. 

"My capacity for happiness," he added, "you could fit into a 
matchbox without taking out the matches first." 

The mattress globbered. This is the noise made by a live, swamp¬ 
dwelling mattress that is deeply moved by a story of personal tragedy. 
The word can also, according to the Ultra-Complete Maximegalon 
Dictionary of Every Language Ever, mean the noise made by the Lord 
High Sanvalvwag of Hollop on discovering that he has forgotten his 
wife's birthday for the second year running. Since there was only ever 
one Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop, and he never married, the word 
is only ever used in a negative or speculative sense, and there is an 
ever-increasing body of opinion which holds that the Ultra-Complete 
Maximegalon Dictionary is not worth the fleet of lorries it takes to 
cart its microstored edition around in. Strangely enough, the 
dictionary omits the word "floopily", which simply means "in the 
manner of something which is floopy". 

The mattress globbered again. 



"I sense a deep dejection in your diodes," it vollued (for the 
meaning of the word "vollue", buy a copy of Squornshellous 
Swamptalk at any remaindered bookshop, or alternatively buy the 
Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary, as the University will be very 
glad to get it off their hands and regain some valuable parking lots), 
"and it saddens me. You should be more mattresslike. We live quiet 
retired lives in the swamp, where we are content to flollop and vollue 
and regard the wetness in a fairly floopy manner. Some of us are 
killed, but all of us are called Zem, so we never know which and 
globbering is thus kept to a minimum. Why are you walking in 
circles?" 

"Because my leg is stuck," said Marvin simply. 

"It seems to me," said the mattress eyeing it compassionately, 

"that it is a pretty poor sort of leg." 

"You are right," said Marvin, "it is." 

"Voon," said the mattress. 

"I expect so," said Marvin, "and I also expect that you find the idea 
of a robot with an artificial leg pretty amusing. You should tell your 
friends Zem and Zem when you see them later; they'll laugh, if I know 
them, which I don't of course - except insofar as I know all organic life 
forms, which is much better than I would wish to. Ha, but my life is 
but a box of wormgears." 

He stomped around again in his tiny circle, around his thin steel 
peg-leg which revolved in the mud but seemed otherwise stuck. 

"But why do you just keep walking round and round?" said the 
mattress. 

"Just to make the point," said Marvin, and continued, round and 
round. 

"Consider it made, my dear friend," flurbled the mattress, 

"consider it made." 

"Just another million years," said Marvin, "just another quick 
million. Then I might try it backwards. Just for the variety, you 
understand." 

The mattress could feel deep in his innermost spring pockets that 
the robot dearly wished to be asked how long he had been trudging in 
this futile and fruitless manner, and with another quiet flurble he did 
so. 



"Oh, just over the one-point-five-million mark, just over," said 
Marvin airily. "Ask me if I ever get bored, go on, ask me." 

The mattress did. 

Marvin ignored the question, he merely trudged with added 
emphasis. 

"I gave a speech once," he said suddenly, and apparently 
unconnectedly. "You may not instantly see why I bring the subject up, 
but that is because my mind works so phenomenally fast, and I am at 
a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you. Let me 
give you an example. Think of a number, any number." 

"Er, five," said the mattress. 

"Wrong," said Marvin. "You see?" 

The mattress was much impressed by this and realized that it was 
in the presence of a not unremarkable mind. It willomied along its 
entire length, sending excited little ripples through its shallow algae- 
covered pool. 

It gupped. 

"Tell me," it urged, "of the speech you once made, I long to hear 
it." 

"It was received very badly," said Marvin, "for a variety of reasons. 

I delivered it," he added, pausing to make an awkward humping sort 
of gesture with his not-exactly-good arm, but his arm which was 
better than the other one which was dishearteningly welded to his 
left side, "over there, about a mile distance." 

He was pointing as well as he could manage, and he obviously 
wanted to make it totally clear that this was as well as he could 
manage, through the mist, over the reeds, to a part of the marsh 
which looked exactly the same as every other part of the marsh. 

"There," he repeated. "I was somewhat of a celebrity at the time." 

Excitement gripped the mattress. It had never heard of speeches 
being delivered on Squornshellous Zeta, and certainly not by 
celebrities. Water spattered off it as a thrill glurried across its back. 

It did something which mattresses very rarely bother to do. 
Summoning every bit of its strength, it reared its oblong body, heaved 
it up into the air and held it quivering there for a few seconds whilst it 
peered through the mist over the reeds at the part of the marsh 
which Marvin had indicated, observing, without disappointment, that 



it was exactly the same as every other part of the marsh. The effort 
was too much, and it flodged back into its pool, deluging Marvin with 
smelly mud, moss and weeds. 

"I was a celebrity," droned the robot sadly, "for a short while on 
account of my miraculous and bitterly resented escape from a fate 
almost as good as death in the heart of a blazing sun. You can guess 
from my condition," he added, "how narrow my escape was. I was 
rescued by a scrap-metal merchant, imagine that. Here I am, brain the 
size of... never mind." 

He trudged savagely for a few seconds. 

"He it was who fixed me up with this leg. Hateful, isn't it? He sold 
me to a Mind Zoo. I was the star exhibit. I had to sit on a box and tell 
my story whilst people told me to cheer up and think positive. 'Give 
us a grin, little robot,' they would shout at me, 'give us a little 
chuckle.' I would explain to them that to get my face to grin would 
take a good couple of hours in a workshop with a wrench, and that 
went down very well." 

"The speech," urged the mattress. "I long to hear of the speech you 
gave in the marshes." 

"There was a bridge built across the marshes. A cyberstructured 
hyperbridge, hundreds of miles in length, to carry ion-buggies and 
freighters over the swamp." 

"A bridge?" quirruled the mattress. "Here in the swamp?" 

"A bridge," confirmed Marvin, "here in the swamp. It was going to 
revitalize the economy of the Squornshellous System. They spent the 
entire economy of the Squornshellous System building it. They asked 
me to open it. Poor fools." 

It began to rain a little, a fine spray slid through the mist. 

"I stood on the platform. For hundreds of miles in front of me, and 
hundreds of miles behind me, the bridge stretched." 

"Did it glitter?" enthused the mattress. 

"It glittered." 

"Did it span the miles majestically?" 

"It spanned the miles majestically." 

"Did it stretch like a silver thread far out into the invisible mist?" 

"Yes," said Marvin. "Do you want to hear this story?" 



"I want to hear your speech," said the mattress. 

"This is what I said. I said, 'I would like to say that it is a very great 
pleasure, honour and privilege for me to open this bridge, but I can't 
because my lying circuits are all out of commission. I hate and despise 
you all. I now declare this hapless cyberstructure open to the 
unthinkable abuse of all who wantonly cross her.' And I plugged 
myself into the opening circuits." 

Marvin paused, remembering the moment. 

The mattress flurred and glurried. It flolloped, gupped and 
willomied, doing this last in a particularly floopy way. 

"Voon," it wurfed at last. "And it was a magnificent occasion?" 

"Reasonably magnificent. The entire thousand-mile-long bridge 
spontaneously folded up its glittering spans and sank weeping into 
the mire, taking everybody with it." 

There was a sad and terrible pause at this point in the conversation 
during which a hundred thousand people seemed unexpectedly to say 
"wop" and a team of white robots descended from the sky like 
dandelion seeds drifting on the wind in tight military formation. For a 
sudden violent moment they were all there, in the swamp, wrenching 
Marvin's false leg off, and then they were gone again in their ship, 
which said "foop". 

"You see the sort of thing I have to contend with?" said Marvin to 
the gobbering mattress. 

Suddenly, a moment later, the robots were back again for another 
violent incident, and this time when they left, the mattress was alone 
in the swamp. He flolloped around in astonishment and alarm. He 
almost lurgled in fear. He reared himself to see over the reeds, but 
there was nothing to see, just more reeds. He listened, but there was 
no sound on the wind beyond the now familiar sound of half-crazed 
etymologists calling distantly to each other across the sullen mire. 



Chapter 8 


The body of Arthur Dent span. 

The Universe shattered into a million glittering fragments around it, 
and each particular shard span silently through the void, reflecting on 
its silver surface some single searing holocaust of fire and destruction. 

And then the blackness behind the Universe exploded, and each 
particular piece of blackness was the furious smoke of hell. 

And the nothingness behind the blackness behind the Universe 
erupted, and behind the nothingness behind the blackness behind the 
shattered Universe was at last the dark figure of an immense man 
speaking immense words. 

"These, then," said the figure, speaking from an immensely 
comfortable chair, "were the Krikkit Wars, the greatest devastation 
ever visited upon our Galaxy. What you have experienced..." 

Slartibartfast floated past, waving. 

"It's just a documentary," he called out. "This is not a good bit. 
Terribly sorry, trying to find the rewind control..." 

"... is what billions of billions of innocent..." 

"Do not," called out Slartibartfast floating past again, and fiddling 
furiously with the thing that he had stuck into the wall of the Room of 
Informational Illusions and which was in fact still stuck there, "agree 
to buy anything at this point." 

"... people, creatures, your fellow beings..." 

Music swelled - again, it was immense music, immense chords. 

And behind the man, slowly, three tall pillars began to emerge out of 
the immensely swirling mist. 

"... experienced, lived through - or, more often, failed to live 
through. Think of that, my friends. And let us not forget - and in just a 
moment I shall be able to suggest a way which will help us always to 
remember - that before the Krikkit Wars, the Galaxy was that rare 
and wonderful thing a happy Galaxy!" 



The music was going bananas with immensity at this point. 

"A Happy Galaxy, my friends, as represented by the symbol of the 
WikkitGate!" 

The three pillars stood out clearly now, three pillars topped with 
two cross pieces in a way which looked stupefyingly familiar to 
Arthur's addled brain. 

"The three pillars," thundered the man. "The Steel Pillar which 
represented the Strength and Power of the Galaxy!" 

Searchlights seared out and danced crazy dances up and down the 
pillar on the left which was, clearly, made of steel or something very 
like it. The music thumped and bellowed. 

"The Perspex Pillar," announced the man, "representing the forces 
of Science and Reason in the Galaxy!" 

Other searchlights played exotically up and down the righthand, 
transparent pillar creating dazzling patterns within it and a sudden 
inexplicable craving for ice-cream in the stomach of Arthur Dent. 

"And," the thunderous voice continued, "the Wooden Pillar, 
representing..." and here his voice became just very slightly hoarse 
with wonderful sentiments, "the forces of Nature and Spirituality." 

The lights picked out the central pillar. The music moved bravely up 
into the realms of complete unspeakability. 

"Between them supporting," the voice rolled on, approaching its 
climax, "the Golden Bail of Prosperity and the Silver Bail of Peace!" 

The whole structure was now flooded with dazzling lights, and the 
music had now, fortunately, gone far beyond the limits of the 
discernible. At the top of the three pillars the two brilliantly gleaming 
bails sat and dazzled. There seemed to be girls sitting on top of them, 
or maybe they were meant to be angels. Angels are usually 
represented as wearing more than that, though. 

Suddenly there was a dramatic hush in what was presumably 
meant to be the Cosmos, and a darkening of the lights. 

"There is not a world," thrilled the man's expert voice, "not a 
civilized world in the Galaxy where this symbol is not revered even 
today. Even in primitive worlds it persists in racial memories. This it 
was that the forces of Krikkit destroyed, and this it is that now locks 
their world away till the end of eternity!" 



And with a flourish, the man produced in his hands a model of the 
Wikkit gate. Scale was terribly hard to judge in this whole 
extraordinary spectacle, but the model looked as if it must have been 
about three feet high. 

"Not the original key, of course. That, as everyone knows, was 
destroyed, blasted into the ever-whirling eddies of the space-time 
continuum and lost for ever. This is a remarkable replica, hand-tooled 
by skilled craftsmen, lovingly assembled using ancient craft secrets 
into a memento you will be proud to own, in memory of those who 
fell, and in tribute to the Galaxy - our Galaxy - which they died to 
defend..." 

Slartibartfast floated past again at this moment. 

"Found it," he said. "We can lose all this rubbish. Just don't nod, 
that's all." 

"Now, let us bow our heads in payment," intoned the voice, and 
then said it again, much faster and backwards. 

Lights came and went, the pillars disappeared, the man gabled 
himself backwards into nothing, the Universe snappily reassembled 
itself around them. 

"You get the gist?" said Slartibartfast. 

"I'm astonished," said Arthur, "and bewildered." 

"I was asleep," said Ford, who floated into view at this point. "Did I 
miss anything?" 

They found themselves once again teetering rather rapidly on the 
edge of an agonizingly high cliff. The wind whipped out from their 
faces and across a bay on which the remains of one of the greatest 
and most powerful space battle-fleets ever assembled in the Galaxy 
was briskly burning itself back into existence. The sky was a sullen 
pink, darkening via a rather curious colour to blue and upwards to 
black. Smoke billowed down out of it at an incredible lick. 

Events were now passing back by them almost too quickly to be 
distinguished, and when, a short while later, a huge starbattle-ship 
rushed away from them as if they'd said "boo", they only just 
recognized it as the point at which they had come in. 

But now things were too rapid, a video-tactile blur which brushed 
and jiggled them through centuries of galactic history, turning, 
twisting, flickering. The sound was a mere thin thrill. 



Periodically through the thickening jumble of events they sensed 
appalling catastrophes, deep horrors, cataclysmic shocks, and these 
were always associated with certain recurring images, the only images 
which ever stood out clearly from the avalance of tumbling history: a 
wicket gate, a small hard red ball, hard white robots, and also 
something less distinct, something dark and cloudy. 

But there was also another sensation which rose clearly out of the 
thrilling passage of time. 

Just as a slow series of clicks when speeded up will lose the 
definition of each individual click and gradually take on the quality of 
a sustained and rising tone, so a series of individual impressions here 
took on the quality of a sustained emotion - and yet not an emotion. 

If it was an emotion, it was a totally emotionless one. It was hatred, 
implacable hatred. It was cold, not like ice is cold, but like a wall is 
cold. It was impersonal, not as a randomly flung fist in a crowd is 
impersonal, but like a computer-issued parking summons is 
impersonal. And it was deadly - again, not like a bullet or a knife is 
deadly, but like a brick wall across a motorway is deadly. 

And just as a rising tone will change in character and take on 
harmonics as it rises, so again, this emotionless emotion seemed to 
rise to an unbearable if unheard scream and suddenly seemed to be a 
scream of guilt and failure. 

And suddenly it stopped. 


They were left standing on a quiet hilltop on a tranquil evening. 

The sun was setting. 

All around them softly undulating green countryside rolled off 
gently into the distance. Birds sang about what they thought of it all, 
and the general opinion seemed to be good. A little way away could 
be heard the sound of children playing, and a little further away than 
the apparent source of that sound could be seen in the dimming 
evening light the outlines of a small town. 

The town appeared to consist mostly of fairly low buildings made 
of white stone. The skyline was of gentle pleasing curves. 

The sun had nearly set. 



As if out of nowhere, music began. Slartibartfast tugged at a switch 
and it stopped. 

A voice said, "This..." Slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it 
stopped. 

"I will tell you about it," he said quietly. 

The place was peaceful. Arthur felt happy. Even Ford seemed 
cheerful. They walked a short way in the direction of the town, and 
the Informational Illusion of the grass was pleasant and springy under 
their feet, and the Informational Illusion of the flowers smelt sweet 
and fragrant. Only Slartibartfast seemed apprehensive and out of 
sorts. 

He stopped and looked up. 

It suddenly occurred to Arthur that, coming as this did at the end, 
so to speak, or rather the beginning of all the horror they had just 
blurredly experienced, something nasty must be about to happen. He 
was distressed to think that something nasty could happen to 
somewhere as idyllic as this. He too glanced up. There was nothing in 
the sky. 

"They're not about to attack here, are they?" he said. He realized 
that this was merely a recording he was walking through, but he still 
felt alarmed. 

"Nothing is about to attack here," said Slartibartfast in a voice 
which unexpectedly trembled with emotion. "This is where it all 
started. This is the place itself. This is Krikkit." 

He stared up into the sky. 

The sky, from one horizon to another, from east to west, from 
north to south, was utterly and completely black. 



Chapter 9 


Stomp stomp. 

Whirrr. 

"Pleased to be of service." 

"Shut up." 

"Thank you." 

Stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp. 

Whirrr. 

"Thank you for making a simple door very happy." 

"Hope your diodes rot." 

"Thank you. Have a nice day." 

Stomp stomp stomp stomp. 

Whirrr. 

"It is my pleasure to open for you..." 

"Zark off." 

"... and my satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job 
well done." 

"I said zark off." 

"Thank you for listening to this message." 

Stomp stomp stomp stomp. 

"Wop." 

Zaphod stopped stomping. He had been stomping around the 
Heart of Gold for days, and so far no door had said "wop" to him. He 
was fairly certain that no door had said "wop" to him now. It was not 
the sort of thing doors said. Too concise. Furthermore, there were not 
enough doors. It sounded as if a hundred thousand people had said 
"wop", which puzzled him because he was the only person on the ship. 

It was dark. Most of the ship's non-essential systems were closed 
down. It was drifting in a remote area of the Galaxy, deep in the inky 



blackness of space. So which particular hundred thousand people 
would turn up at this point and say a totally unexpected "wop"? 

He looked about him, up the corridor and down the corridor. It was 
all in deep shadow. There were just the very dim pinkish outlines of 
the doors which glowed in the dark and pulsed whenever they spoke, 
though he had tried every way he could think of stopping them. 

The lights were off so that his heads could avoid looking at each 
other, because neither of them was currently a particularly engaging 
sight, and nor had they been since he had made the error of looking 
into his soul. 

It had indeed been an error. It had been late one night - of course. 

It had been a difficult day - of course. 

There had been soulful music playing on the ship's sound system - 
of course. 

And he had, of course, been slightly drunk. 

In other words, all the usual conditions which bring on a bout of 
soul-searching had applied, but it had, nevertheless, clearly been an 
error. 

Standing now, silent and alone in the dark corridor he remembered 
the moment and shivered. His one head looked one way and his other 
the other and each decided that the other was the way to go. 

He listened but could hear nothing. 

All there had been was the "wop". 

It seemed an awfully long way to bring an awfully large number of 
people just to say one word. 

He started nervously to edge his way in the direction of the bridge. 
There at least he would feel in control. He stopped again. The way he 
was feeling he didn't think he was an awfully good person to be in 
control. 

The first shock of that moment, thinking back, had been 
discovering that he actually had a soul. 

In fact he'd always more or less assumed that he had one as he had 
a full complement of everything else, and indeed two of somethings, 
but suddenly actually to encounter the thing lurking there deep 
within him had giving him a severe jolt. 



And then to discover (this was the second shock) that it wasn't the 
totally wonderful object which he felt a man in his position had a 
natural right to expect had jolted him again. 

Then he had thought about what his position actually was and the 
renewed shock had nearly made him spill his drink. He drained it 
quickly before anything serious happened to it. He then had another 
quick one to follow the first one down and check that it was all right. 

"Freedom," he said aloud. 

Trillian came on to the bridge at that point and said several 
enthusiastic things on the subject of freedom. 

"I can't cope with it," he said darkly, and sent a third drink down to 
see why the second hadn't yet reported on the condition of the first. 
He looked uncertainly at both of her and preferred the one on the 
right. 

He poured a drink down his other throat with the plan that it would 
head the previous one off at the pass, join forces with it, and together 
they would get the second to pull itself together. Then all three would 
go off in search of the first, give it a good talking to and maybe a bit of 
a sing as well. 

He felt uncertain as to whether the fourth drink had understood all 
that, so he sent down a fifth to explain the plan more fully and a sixth 
for moral support. 

"You're drinking too much," said Trillian. 

His heads collided trying to sort out the four of her he could now 
see into a whole position. He gave up and looked at the navigation 
screen and was astonished to see a quite phenomenal number of 
stars. 

"Excitement and adventure and really wild things," he muttered. 

"Look," she said in a sympathetic tone of voice, and sat down near 
him, "it's quite understandable that you're going to feel a little 
aimless for a bit." 

He boggled at her. He had never seen anyone sit on their own lap 
before. 

"Wow," he said. He had another drink. 

"You've finished the mission you've been on for years." 

"I haven't been on it. I've tried to avoid being on it." 



"You’ve still finished it." 

He grunted. There seemed to be a terrific party going on in his 
stomach. 

"I think it finished me," he said. "Here I am, Zaphod Beeblebrox, I 
can go anywhere, do anything. I have the greatest ship in the know 
sky, a girl with whom things seem to be working out pretty well..." 

"Are they?" 

"As far as I can tell I'm not an expert in personal relationships..." 

Trillian raised her eyebrows. 

"I am," he added, "one hell of a guy, I can do anything I want only I 
just don’t have the faintest idea what." 

He paused. 

"One thing," he further added, "has suddenly ceased to lead to 
another" - in contradiction of which he had another drink and slid 
gracelessly off his chair. 

Whilst he slept it off, Trillian did a little research in the ship's copy 
of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It had some advice to offer on 
drunkenness. 

"Go to it," it said, "and good luck." 

It was cross-referenced to the entry concerning the size of the 
Universe and ways of coping with that. 

Then she found the entry on Han Wavel, an exotic holiday planet, 
and one of the wonders of the Galaxy. 

Han Wavel is a world which consists largely of fabulous ultra-luxury 
hotels and casinos, all of which have been formed by the natural 
erosion of wind and rain. 

The chances of this happening are more or less one to infinity 
against. Little is known of how this came about because none of the 
geophysicists, probability statisticians, meteoranalysts or 
bizzarrologists who are so keen to research it can afford to stay there. 

Terrific, thought Trillian to herself, and within a few hours the great 
white running-shoe ship was slowly powering down out of the sky 
beneath a hot brilliant sun towards a brightly coloured sandy 
spaceport. The ship was clearly causing a sensation on the ground, 
and Trillian was enjoying herself. She heard Zaphod moving around 
and whistling somewhere in the ship. 



"How are you?" she said over the general intercom. 

"Fine," he said brightly, "terribly well." 

"Where are you?" 

"In the bathroom." 

"What are you doing?" 

"Staying here." 

After an hour or two it became plain that he meant it and the ship 
returned to the sky without having once opened its hatchway. 

"Heigh ho," said Eddie the Computer. 

Trillian nodded patiently, tapped her fingers a couple of times and 
pushed the intercom switch. 

"I think that enforced fun is probably not what you need at this 
point." 

"Probably not," replied Zaphod from wherever he was. 

"I think a bit of physical challenge would help draw you out of 
yourself." 

"Whatever you think, I think," said Zaphod. 

"RECREATIONAL IMPOSSIBILITIES" was a heading which caught 
Trillian's eye when, a short while later, she sat down to flip through 
the Guide again, and as the Heart of Gold rushed at improbable 
speeds in an indeterminate direction, she sipped a cup of something 
undrinkable from the Nutrimatic Drink Dispenser and read about how 
to fly. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say on the subject 
of flying. 

There is an art, it says, or rather a knack to flying. 

The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and 
miss. 

Pick a nice day, it suggests, and try it. 

The first part is easy. 

All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all 
your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it's going to hurt. 

That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground. 

Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying 
properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard. 



Clearly, it's the second point, the missing, which presents the 
difficulties. 

One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It's 
no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't. 
You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something 
else when you're halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking 
about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it's going to 
hurt if you fail to miss it. 

It is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these 
three things during the split second you have at your disposal. Hence 
most people's failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this 
exhilarating and spectacular sport. 

If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention 
momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair 
of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and/or personal 
inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly 
spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby 
twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely 
and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to 
be a slightly foolish manner. 

This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration. 

Bob and float, float and bob. 

Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let 
yourself waft higher. 

Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because 
they are unlikely to say anything helpful. 

They are most likely to say something along the lines of, "Good God, 
you can't possibly be flying!" 

It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be 
right. 

Waft higher and higher. 

Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops 
breathing regularly. 

DO NOT WAVE AT ANYBODY. 

When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of 
distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve. 



You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your 
flight, your speed, your manoeuvrability, and the trick usually lies in 
not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do, but just 
allowing it to happen as if it was going to anyway. 

You will also learn how to land properly, which is something you 
will almost certainly cock up, and cock up badly, on your first attempt. 

There are private flying clubs you can join which help you achieve 
the all-important moment of distraction. They hire people with 
surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and 
exhibit and/or explain them at the crucial moments. Few genuine 
hitch-hikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but some may 
be able to get temporary employment at them. 

Trillian read this longingly, but reluctantly decided that Zaphod 
wasn't really in the right frame of mind for attempting to fly, or for 
walking through mountains or for trying to get the Brantisvogan Civil 
Service to acknowledge a change-of-address card, which were the 
other things listed under the heading "RECREATIONAL 
IMPOSSIBILITIES". 

Instead, she flew the ship to Allosimanius Syneca, a world of ice, 
snow, mind-hurtling beauty and stunning cold. The trek from the 
snow plains of Liska to the summit of the Ice Crystal Pyramids of 
Sastantua is long and gruelling, even with jet skis and a team of 
Syneca Snowhounds, but the view from the top, a view which takes in 
the Stin Glacier Fields, the shimmering Prism Mountains and the far 
ethereal dancing icelights, is one which first freezes the mind and 
then slowly releases it to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty, 
and Trillian, for one, felt that she could do with a bit of having her 
mind slowly released to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty. 

They went into a low orbit. 

There lay the silverwhite beauty of Allosimanius Syneca beneath 
them. 

Zaphod stayed in bed with one head stuck under a pillow and the 
other doing crosswords till late into the night. 

Trillian nodded patiently again, counted to a sufficiently high 
number, and told herself that the important thing now was just to get 
Zaphod talking. 



She prepared, by dint of deactivating all the robot kitchen 
synthomatics, the most fabulously delicious meal she could contrive - 
delicately oiled meals, scented fruits, fragrant cheeses, fine Aldebaran 
wines. 

She carried it through to him and asked if he felt like talking things 
through. 

"Zark off," said Zaphod. 

Trillian nodded patiently to herself, counted to an even higher 
number, tossed the tray lightly aside, walked to the transport room 
and just teleported herself the hell out of his life. 

She didn't even programme any coordinates, she hadn't the 
faintest idea where she was going, she just went - a random row of 
dots flowing through the Universe. 

"Anything," she said to herself as she left, "is better than this." 

"Good job too," muttered Zaphod to himself, turned over and 
failed to go to sleep. 

The next day he restlessly paced the empty corridors of the ship, 
pretending not to look for her, though he knew she wasn't there. He 
ignored the computer's querulous demands to know just what the 
hell was going on around here by fitting a small electronic gag across 
a pair of its terminals. 

After a while he began to turn down the lights. There was nothing 
to see. Nothing was about to happen. 

Lying in bed one night - and night was now virtually continuous on 
the ship - he decided to pull himself together, to get things into some 
kind of perspective. He sat up sharply and started to pull clothes on. 
He decided that there must be someone in the Universe feeling more 
wretched, miserable and forsaken than himself, and he determined to 
set out and find him. 

Halfway to the bridge it occurred to him that it might be Marvin, 
and he returned to bed. 

It was a few hours later than this, as he stomped disconsolately 
about the darkened corridors swearing at cheerful doors, that he 
heard the "wop" said, and it made him very nervous. 

He leant tensely against the corridor wall and frowned like a man 
trying to unbend a corkscrew by telekinesis. He laid his fingertips 
against the wall and felt an unusual vibration. And now he could quite 



clearly hear slight noises, and could hear where they were coming 
from - they were coming from the bridge. 

"Computer?" he hissed. 

"Mmmm?" said the computer terminal nearest him, equally quietly. 

"Is there someone on this ship?" 

"Mmmmm," said the computer. 

"Who is it?" 

Mmmmm mmm mmmmm," said the computer. 

"What?" 

"Mmmmm mmmm mm mmmmmmmm." 

Zaphod buried one of his faces in two of his hands. 

"Oh, Zarquon," he muttered to himself. Then he stared up the 
corridor towards the entrance to the bridge in the dim distance from 
which more and purposeful noises were coming, and in which the 
gagged terminals were situated. 

"Computer," he hissed again. 

"Mmmmm?" 

"When I ungag you..." 

"Mmmmm." 

"Remind me to punch myself in the mouth." 

"Mmmmm mmm?" 

"Either one. Now just tell me this. One for yes, two for no. Is it 
dangerous?" 

"Mmmmm." 

"It is?" 

"Mmmm." 

"You didn't just go 'mmmm' twice?" 

"Mmmm mmmm." 

"Hmmmm." 

He inched his way up the corridor as if he would rather be yarding 
his way down it, which was true. 

He was within two yards of the door to the bridge when he 
suddenly realized to his horror that it was going to be nice to him, and 
he stopped dead. He hadn't been able to turn off the doors' courtesy 
voice circuits. 



This doorway to the bridge was concealed from view within it 
because of the excitingly chunky way in which the bridge had been 
designed to curve round, and he had been hoping to enter 
unobserved. 

He leant despondently back against the wall again and said some 
words which his other head was quite shocked to hear. 

He peered at the dim pink outline of the door, and discovered that 
in the darkness of the corridor he could just about make out the 
Sensor Field which extended out into the corridor and told the door 
when there was someone there for whom it must open and to whom 
it must make a cheery and pleasant remark. 

He pressed himself hard back against the wall and edged himself 
towards the door, flattening his chest as much as he possibly could to 
avoid brushing against the very, very dim perimeter of the field. He 
held his breath, and congratulated himself on having lain in bed 
sulking for the last few days rather than trying to work out his feelings 
on chest expanders in the ship's gym. 

He then realized he was going to have to speak at this point. 

He took a series of very shallow breaths, and then said as quickly 
and as quietly as he could, "Door, if you can hear me, say so very, very 
quietly." 

Very, very quietly, the door murmured, "I can hear you." 

"Good. Now, in a moment. I'm going to ask you to open. When you 
open I do not want you to say that you enjoyed it, OK?" 

"OK." 

"And I don't want you to say to me that I have made a simple door 
very happy, or that it is your pleasure to open for me and your 
satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done, 

OK?" 

"OK." 

"And I do not want you to ask me to have a nice day, understand?" 

"I understand." 

"OK," said Zaphod, tensing himself, "open now." 

The door slid open quietly. Zaphod slipped quietly through. The 
door closed quietly behind him. 

"Is that the way you like it, Mr. Beeblebrox?" said the door out loud. 



"I want you to imagine," said Zaphod to the group of white robots 
who swung round to stare at him at that point, "that I have an 
extremely powerful Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in my hand." 

There was an immensely cold and savage silence. The robots 
regarded him with hideously dead eyes. They stood very still. There 
was something intensely macabre about their appearance, especially 
to Zaphod who had never seen one before or even known anything 
about them. The Krikkit Wars belonged to the ancient past of the 
Galaxy, and Zaphod had spent most of his early history lessons 
plotting how he was going to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle 
next to him, and since his teaching computer had been an integral 
part of this plot it had eventually had all its history circuits wiped and 
replaced with an entirely different set of ideas which had then 
resulted in it being scrapped and sent to a home for Degenerate 
Cybermats, whither it was followed by the girl who had inadvertently 
fallen deeply in love with the unfortunate machine, with the result (a) 
that Zaphod never got near her and (b) that he missed out on a period 
of ancient history that would have been of inestimable value to him at 
this moment. 

He stared at them in shock. 

It was impossible to explain why, but their smooth and sleek white 
bodies seemed to be the utter embodiment of clean, clinical evil. 

From their hideously dead eyes to their powerful lifeless feet, they 
were clearly the calculated product of a mind that wanted simply to 
kill. Zaphod gulped in cold fear. 

They had been dismantling part of the rear bridge wall, and had 
forced a passage through some of the vital innards of the ship. 
Through the tangled wreckage Zaphod could see, with a further and 
worse sense of shock, that they were tunnelling towards the very 
heart of the ship, the heart of the Improbability Drive that had been 
so mysteriously created out of thin air, the Heart of Gold itself. 

The robot closest to him was regarding him in such a way as to 
suggest that it was measuring every smallest particle of his body, 
mind and capability. And when it spoke, what it said seemed to bear 
this impression out. Before going on to what it actually said, it is 
worth recording at this point that Zaphod was the first living organic 
being to hear one of these creatures speak for something over ten 
billion years. If he had paid more attention to his ancient history 



lessons and less to his organic being, he might have been more 
impressed by this honour. 

The robot's voice was like its body, cold, sleek and lifeless. It had 
almost a cultured rasp to it. It sounded as ancient as it was. 

It said, "You do have a Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in your hand." 

Zaphod didn't know what it meant for a moment, but then he 
glanced down at his own hand and was relieved to see that what he 
had found clipped to a wall bracket was indeed what he had thought 
it was. 

"Yeah," he said in a kind of relieved sneer, which is quite tricky, 
"well, I wouldn't want to overtax your imagination, robot." For a while 
nobody said anything, and Zaphod realized that the robots were 
obviously not here to make conversation, and that it was up to him. 

"I can't help noticing that you have parked your ship," he said with 
a nod of one of his heads in the appropriate direction, "through 
mine." 

There was no denying this. Without regard for any kind of proper 
dimensional behaviour they had simply materialized their ship 
precisely where they wanted it to be, which meant that it was simply 
locked through the Heart of Gold as if they were nothing more than 
two combs. 

Again, they made no response to this, and Zaphod wondered if the 
conversation would gather any momentum if he phrased his part of it 
in the form of questions. 

"... haven't you?" he added. 

"Yes," replied the robot." 

"Er, OK," said Zaphod. "So what are you cats doing here?" 

Silence. 

"Robots," said Zaphod, "what are you robots doing here?" 

"We have come," rasped the robot, "for the Gold of the Bail." 

Zaphod nodded. He waggled his gun to invite further elaboration. 
The robot seemed to understand this. 

"The Gold Bail is part of the Key we seek," continued the robot, "to 
release our Masters from Krikkit." 

Zaphod nodded again. He waggled his gun again. 



"The Key," continued the robot simply, "was disintegrated in time 
and space. The Golden Bail is embedded in the device which drives 
your ship. It will be reconstituted in the Key. Our Masters shall be 
released. The Universal Readjustment will continue." 

Zaphod nodded again. 

"What are you talking about?" he said. 

A slightly pained expression seemed to cross the robot's totally 
expressionless face. He seemed to be finding the conversation 
depressing. 

"Obliteration," it said. "We seek the Key," it repeated, "we already 
have the Wooden Pillar, the Steel Pillar and the Perspex Pillar. In a 
moment we will have the Gold Bail..." 

"No you won't." 

"We will," stated the robot. 

"No you won't. It makes my ship work." 

"In a moment," repeated the robot patiently, "we will have the 
Gold Bail..." 

"You will not," said Zaphod. 

"And then we must go," said the robot, in all seriousness, "to a 
party." 

"Oh," said Zaphod, startled. "Can I come?" 

"No," said the robot. "We are going to shoot you." 

"Oh yeah?" said Zaphod, waggling his gun. 

"Yes," said the robot, and they shot him. 

Zaphod was so surprised that they had to shoot him again before 
he fell down. 



Chapter 10 


"Shhh," said Slartibartfast. "Listen and watch." 

Night had now fallen on ancient Krikkit. The sky was dark and 
empty. The only light was coming from the nearby town, from which 
pleasant convivial sounds were drifting quietly on the breeze. They 
stood beneath a tree from which heady fragrances wafted arou nd 
them. Arthur squatted and felt the Informational Illusion of the soil 
and the grass. He ran it through his fingers. The soil seemed heavy 
and rich, the grass strong. It was hard to avoid the impression that 
this was a thoroughly delightful place in all respects. 

The sky was, however, extremely blank and seemed to Arthur to 
cast a certain chill over the otherwise idyllic, if currently invisible, 
landscape. Still, he supposed, it's a question of what you're used to. 

He felt a tap on his shoulder and looked up. Slartibartfast was 
quietly directing his attention to something down the other side of 
the hill. He looked and could just see some faint lights dancing and 
waving, and moving slowly in their direction. 

As they came nearer, sounds became audible too, and soon the 
dim lights and noises resolved themselves into a small group of 
people who were walking home across the hill towards the town. 

They walked quite near the watchers beneath the tree, swinging 
lanterns which made soft and crazy lights dance among the trees and 
grass, chattering contentedly, and actually singing a song about how 
terribly nice everything was, how happy they were, how much they 
enjoyed working on the farm, and how pleasant it was to be going 
home to see their wives and children, with a lilting chorus to the 
effect that the flowers were smelling particularly nice at this time of 
year and that it was a pity the dog had died seeing as it liked them so 
much. Arthur could almost imagine Paul McCartney sitting with his 
feet up by the fire on evening, humming it to Linda and wondering 
what to buy with the proceeds, and thinking probably Essex. 

"The Masters of Krikkit," breathed Slartibartfast in sepulchral tones. 



Coming, as it did, so hard upon the heels of his own thoughts about 
Essex this remark caused Arthur a moment's confusion. Then the logic 
of the situation imposed itself on his scattered mind, and he 
discovered that he still didn't understand what the old man meant. 

"What?" he said. 

"The Masters of Krikkit," said Slartibartfast again, and if his 
breathing had been sepulchral before, this time he sounded like 
someone in Hades with bronchitis. 

Arthur peered at the group and tried to make sense of what little 
information he had at his disposal at this point. 

The people in the group were clearly alien, if only because they 
seemed a little tall, thin, angular and almost as pale as to be white, 
but otherwise they appeared remarkably pleasant; a little whimsical 
perhaps, one wouldn't necessarily want to spend a long coach journey 
with them, but the point was that if they deviated in any way from 
being good straightforward people it was in being perhaps too nice 
rather than not nice enough. So why all this rasping lungwork from 
Slartibartfast which would seem more appropriate to a radio 
commercial for one of those nasty films about chainsaw operators 
taking their work home with them? 

Then, this Krikkit angle was a tough one, too. He hadn't quite 
fathomed the connection between what he knew as cricket, and 
what... 

Slartibartfast interrupted his train of thought at this point as if 
sensing what was going through his mind. 

"The game you know as cricket," he said, and his voice still seemed 
to be wandering lost in subterranean passages, "is just one of those 
curious freaks of racial memory which can keep images alive in the 
mind aeons after their true significance has been lost in the mists of 
time. Of all the races on the Galaxy, only the English could possibly 
revive the memory of the most horrific wars ever to sunder the 
Universe and transform it into what I'm afraid is generally regarded as 
an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game. 

"Rather fond of it myself," he added, "but in most people's eyes 
you have been inadvertently guilty of the most grotesque bad taste. 
Particularly the bit about the little red ball hitting the wicket, that's 
very nasty." 



"Um," said Arthur with a reflective frown to indicate that his 
cognitive synapses were coping with this as best as they could, "um." 

"And these," said Slartibartfast, slipping back into crypt guttural 
and indicating the group of Krikkit men who had now walked past 
them, "are the ones who started it all, and it will start tonight. Come, 
we will follow, and see why." 

They slipped out from underneath the tree, and followed the 
cheery party along the dark hill path. Their natural instinct was to 
tread quietly and stealthily in pursuit of their quarry, though, as they 
were simply walking through a recorded Informational Illusion, they 
could as easily have been wearing euphoniums and woad for all the 
notice their quarry would have taken of them. 

Arthur noticed that a couple of members of the party were now 
singing a different song. It came lilting back to them through the soft 
night air, and was a sweet romantic ballad which would have netted 
McCartney Kent and Essex and enabled him to put in a fair offer for 
Hampshire. 

"You must surely know," said Slartibartfast to Ford, "what it is that 
is about to happen?" 

"Me?" said Ford. "No." 

"Did you not learn Ancient Galactic History when you were a 
child?" 

"I was in the cybercubicle behind Zaphod," said Ford, "it was very 
distracting. Which isn't to say that I didn't learn some pretty stunning 
things." 

At this point Arthur noticed a curious feature to the song that the 
party were singing. The middle eight bridge, which would have had 
McCartney firmly consolidated in Winchester and gazing intently over 
the Test Valley to the rich pickings of the New Forest beyond, had 
some curious lyrics. The songwriter was referring to meeting with a 
girl not "under the moon" or "beneath the stars" but "above the 
grass", which struck Arthur a little prosaic. Then he looked up again at 
the bewildering black sky, and had the distinct feeling that there was 
an important point here, if only he could grasp what it was. It gave 
him a feeling of being alone in the Universe, and he said so. 

"No," said Slartibartfast, with a slight quickening of his step, "the 
people of Krikkit have never thought to themselves 'We are alone in 



the Universe.' They are surrounded by a huge Dust Cloud, you see, 
their single sun with its single world, and they are right out on the 
utmost eastern edge of the Galaxy. Because of the Dust Cloud there 
has never been anything to see in the sky. At night it is totally blank. 
During the day there is the sun, but you can't look directly at that so 
they don't. They are hardly aware of the sky. It's as if they had a blind 
spot which extended 180 degrees from horizon to horizon. 

"You see, the reason why they have never thought 'We are alone in 
the Universe' is that until tonight they don't know about the Universe. 
Until tonight." 

He moved on, leaving the words ringing in the air behind him. 

"Imagine," he said, "never even thinking 'We are alone' simply 
because it has never occurred to you to think that there's any other 
way to be." 

He moved on again. 

"I'm afraid this is going to be a little unnerving," he added. 

As he spoke, they became aware of a very thin roaring scream high 
up in the sightless sky above them. They glanced upwards in alarm, 
but for a moment or two could see nothing. 

Then Arthur noticed that the people in the party in front of them 
had heard the noise, but that none of them seemed to know what to 
do with it. They were glancing around themselves in consternation, 
left, right, forwards, backwards, even at the ground. It never occurred 
to them to look upwards. 

The profoundness of the shock and horror they emanated a few 
moments later when the burning wreckage of a spaceship came 
hurtling and screaming out of the sky and crashed about half a mile 
from where they were standing was something that you had to be 
there to experience. 

Some speak of the Heart of Gold in hushed tones, some of the 
Starship Bistromath. 

Many speak of the legendary and gigantic Starship Titanic, a 
majestic and luxurious cruise-liner launched from the great 
shipbuilding asteroid complexes of Artifactovol some hundreds of 
years ago now, and with good reason. 



It was sensationally beautiful, staggeringly huge, and more 
pleasantly equipped than any ship in what now remains of history 
(see note below on the Campaign for Real Time) but it had the 
misfortune to be built in the very earliest days of Improbability 
Physics, long before this difficult and cussed branch of knowledge was 
fully, or at all, understood. 

The designers and engineers decided, in their innocence, to build a 
prototype Improbability Field into it, which was meant, supposedly, to 
ensure that it was Infinitely Improbable that anything would ever go 
wrong with any part of the ship. 

They did not realize that because of the quasi-reciprocal and 
circular nature of all Improbability calculations, anything that was 
Infinitely Improbable was actually very likely to happen almost 
immediately. 

The Starship Titanic was a monstrously pretty sight as it lay 
beached like a silver Arcturan Megavoidwhale amongst the laser-lit 
tracery of its construction gantries, a brilliant cloud of pins and 
needles of light against the deep interstellar blackness; but when 
launched, it did not even manage to complete its very first radio 
message - an SOS - before undergoing a sudden and gratuitous total 
existence failure. 

However, the same event which saw the disastrous failure of one 
science in its infancy also witnessed the apotheosis of another. It was 
conclusively proven that more people watched the tri-d coverage of 
the launch than actually existed at the time, and this has now been 
recognized as the greatest achievement ever in the science of 
audience research. 

Another spectacular media event of that time was the supernova 
which the star Ysllodins underwent a few hours later. Ysllodins is the 
star around which most of the Galaxy's major insurance underwriters 
live, or rather lived. 

But whilst these spaceships, and other great ones which come to 
mind, such as the Galactic Fleet Battleships - the GSS Daring, the GSS 
Audacy and the GSS Suicidal Insanity - are all spoken of with awe, 
pride, enthusiasm, affection, admiration, regret, jealousy, resentment, 
in fact most of the better known emotions, the one which regularly 
commands the most actual astonishment was Krikkit One, the first 



spaceship ever built by the people of Krikkit. This is not because it was 
a wonderful ship. It wasn't. 

It was a crazy piece of near junk. It looked as if it had been knocked 
up in somebody's backyard, and this was in fact precisely where it had 
been knocked up. The astonishing thing about the ship was not that it 
was one well (it wasn't) but that it was done at all. The period of time 
which had elapsed between the moment that the people of Krikkit 
had discovered that there was such a thing as space and the 
launching of their first spaceship was almost exactly a year. 

Ford Prefect was extremely grateful, as he strapped himself in, that 
this was just another Informational Illusion, and that he was therefore 
completely safe. In real life it wasn't a ship he would have set foot in 
for all the rice wine in China. "Extremely rickety" was one phrase 
which sprang to mind, and "Please may I get out?" was another. 

"This is going to fly?" said Arthur, giving gaunt looks, at the lashed- 
together pipework and wiring which festooned the cramped interior 
of the ship. 

Slartibartfast assured him that it would, that they were perfectly 
safe and that it was all going to be extremely instructive and not a 
little harrowing. 

Ford and Arthur decided just to relax and be harrowed. 

"Why not," said Ford, "go mad?" 

In front of them and, of course, totally unaware of their presence 
for the very good reason that they weren't actually there, were the 
three pilots. They had also constructed the ship. They had been on 
the hill path that night singing wholesome heartwarming songs. Their 
brains had been very slightly turned by the nearby crash of the alien 
spaceship. They had spent weeks stripping every tiniest last secret out 
of the wreckage of that burnt-up spaceship, all the while singing lilting 
spaceship-stripping ditties. They had then built their own ship and this 
was it. This was their ship, and they were currently singing a little 
song about that too, expressing the twin joys of achievement and 
ownership. The chorus was a little poignant, and told of their sorrow 
that their work had kept them such long hours in the garage, away 
from the company of their wives and children, who had missed them 
terribly but had kept them cheerful by bringing them continual stories 
of how nicely the puppy was growing up. 

Pow, they took off. 



They roared into the sky like a ship that knew precisely what it was 
doing. 

"No way," said Ford a while later after they had recovered from the 
shock of acceleration, and were climbing up out of the planet's 
atmosphere, "no way," he repeated, "does anyone design and build a 
ship like this in a year, no matter how motivated. I don't believe it. 
Prove it to me and I still won't believe it." He shook his head 
thoughtfully and gazed out of a tiny port at the nothingness outside it. 

The trip passed uneventfully for a while, and Slartibartfast 
fastwound them through it. 

Very quickly, therefore, they arrived at the inner perimeter of the 
hollow, spherical Dust Cloud which surrounded their sun and home 
planet, occupying, as it were, the next orbit out. 

It was more as if there was a gradual change in the texture and 
consistency of space. The darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple 
past them. It was a very cold darkness, a very blank and heavy 
darkness, it was the darkness of the night sky of Krikkit. 

The coldness and heaviness and blankness of it took a slow grip on 
Arthur's heart, and he felt acutely aware of the feelings of the Krikkit 
pilots which hung in the air like a thick static charge. They were now 
on the very boundary of the historical knowledge of their race. This 
was the very limit beyond which none of them had ever speculated, 
or even known that there was any speculation to be done. 

The darkness of the cloud buffeted at the ship. Inside was the 
silence of history. Their historic mission was to find out if there was 
anything or anywhere on the other side of the sky, from which the 
wrecked spaceship could have come, another world maybe, strange 
and incomprehensible though this thought was to the enclosed minds 
of those who had lived beneath the sky of Krikkit. 

History was gathering itself to deliver another blow. 

Still the darkness thrummed at them, the blank enclosing darkness. 
It seemed closer and closer, thicker and thicker, heavier and heavier. 
And suddenly it was gone. 

They flew out of the cloud. 

They saw the staggering jewels of the night in their infinite dust 
and their minds sang with fear. 



For a while they flew on, motionless against the starry sweep of the 
Galaxy, itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the Universe. 
And then they turned round. 

"It'll have to go," the men of Krikkit said as they headed back for 
home. 

On the way back they sang a number of tuneful and reflective 
songs on the subjects of peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family 
life and the obliteration of all other life forms. 



Chapter 11 


"So you see," said Slartibartfast, slowly stirring his artificially 
constructed coffee, and thereby also stirring the whirlpool interfaces 
between real and unreal numbers, between the interactive 
perceptions of mind and Universe, and thus generating the 
restructured matrices of implicitly enfolded subjectivity which 
allowed his ship to reshape the very concept of time and space, "how 
it is." 

"Yes," said Arthur. 

"Yes," said Ford. 

"What do I do," said Arthur, "with this piece of chicken?" 

Slartibartfast glanced at him gravely. 

"Toy with it," he said, "toy with it." 

He demonstrated with his own piece. 

Arthur did so, and felt the slight tingle of a mathematical function 
thrilling through the chicken leg as it moved four-dimensionally 
through what Slartibartfast had assured him was five-dimensional 
space. 

"Overnight," said Slartibartfast, "the whole population of Krikkit 
was transformed from being charming, delightful, intelligent..." 

"... if whimsical..." interpolated Arthur. 

"... ordinary people," said Slartibartfast, "into charming, delightful, 
intelligent..." 

"... whimsical..." 

"... manic xenophobes. The idea of a Universe didn't fit into their 
world picture, so to speak. They simply couldn't cope with it. And so, 
charmingly, delightfully, intelligently, whimsically if you like, they 
decided to destroy it. What's the matter now?" 

"I don't like the wine very much," said Arthur sniffing it. 

"Well, send it back. It's all part of the mathematics of it." 



Arthur did so. He didn't like the topography of the waiter's smile, 
but he'd never liked graphs anyway. 

"Where are we going?" said Ford. 

"Back to the Room of Informational Illusions," said Slartibartfast, 
rising and patting his mouth with the mathematical representation of 
a paper napkin, "for the second half." 



Chapter 12 


"The people of Krikkit," said His High Judgmental Supremacy, 
Judiciary Pag, UVR (the Learned, Impartial and Very Relaxed) 

Chairman of the Board of Judges at the Krikkit War Crimes Trial, "are, 
well, you know, they're just a bunch of real sweet guys, you know, 
who just happen to want to kill everybody. Hell, I feel the same way 
some mornings. Shit. 

"OK," he continued, swinging his feet up on to the bench in front of 
him and pausing a moment to pick a thread off his Ceremonial Beach 
Loafers, "so you wouldn't necessarily want to share a Galaxy with 
these guys." 

This was true. 

The Krikkit attack on the Galaxy had been stunning. Thousands and 
thousands of huge Krikkit warships had leapt suddenly out of 
hyperspace and simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of 
major worlds, first seizing vital material supplies for building the next 
wave, and then calmly zapping those worlds out of existence. 

The Galaxy, which had been enjoying a period of unusual peace 
and prosperity at the time, reeled like a man getting mugged in a 
meadow. 

"I mean," continued Judiciary Pag, gazing round the ultra-modern 
(this was ten billion years ago, when "ultra-modern" meant lots of 
stainless steel and brushed concrete) and huge courtroom, "these 
guys are just obsessed." 

This too was true, and is the only explanation anyone has yet 
managed to come up with for the unimaginable speed with which the 
people of Krikkit had pursued their new and absolute purpose - the 
destruction of everything that wasn't Krikkit. 

It is also the only explanation for their bewildering sudden grasp of 
all the hypertechnology involved in building their thousands of 
spaceships, and their millions of lethal white robots. 



These had really struck terror into the hearts of everyone who had 
encountered them - in most cases, however, the terror was 
extremely short-lived, as was the person experiencing the terror. They 
were savage, single-minded flying battle machines. They wielded 
formidable multifunctional battleclubs which, brandished one way, 
would knock down buildings and, brandished another way, fired 
blistering Omni-Destructo Zap Rays and, brandished a third way, 
launched a hideous arsenal of grenades, ranging from minor 
incendiary devices to Maxi-Slorta Hypernuclear Devices which could 
take out a major sun. Simply striking the grenades with the 
battleclubs simultaneously primed them, and launched them with 
phenomenal accuracy over distances ranging from mere yards to 
hundreds of thousands of miles. 

"OK," said Judiciary Pag again, "so we won." He paused and 
chewed a little gum. "We won," he repeated, "but that's no big deal. I 
mean a medium-sized galaxy against one little world, and how long 
did it take us? Clerk of the Court?" 

"M'lud?" said the severe little man in black, rising. 

"How long, kiddo?" 

"It is a trifle difficult, m'lud, to be precise in this matter. Time and 
distance..." 

"Relax, guy, be vague." 

"I hardly like to be vague, m'lud, over such a..." 

"Bite the bullet and be it." 

The Clerk of the Court blinked at him. It was clear that like most of 
the Galactic legal profession he found Judiciary Pag (or Zipo Bibrok 
5x108, as his private name was known, inexplicably, to be) a rather 
distressing figure. He was clearly a bounder and a cad. He seemed to 
think that the fact that he was the possessor of the finest legal mind 
ever discovered gave him the right to behave exactly as he liked, and 
unfortunately he appeared to be right. 

"Er, well, m'lud, very approximately, two thousand years," the 
Clerk murmured unhappily. 

"And how many guys zilched out?" 

"Two grillion, m'lud." The Clerk sat down. A hydrospectic photo of 
him at this point would have revealed that he was steaming slightly. 



Judiciary Pag gazed once more around the courtroom, wherein 
were assembled hundreds of the very highest officials of the entire 
Galactic administration, all in their ceremonial uniforms or bodies, 
depending on metabolism and custom. Behind a wall of Zap-Proof 
Crystal stood a representative group of the people of Krikkit, looking 
with calm, polite loathing at all the aliens gathered to pass judgment 
on them. This was the most momentous occasion in legal history, and 
Judiciary Pag knew it. 

He took out his chewing gum and stuck it under his chair. 

"That's a whole lotta stiffs," he said quietly. 

The grim silence in the courtroom seemed in accord with this view. 

"So, like I said, these are a bunch of really sweet guys, but you 
wouldn't want to share a Galaxy with them, not if they're just gonna 
keep at it, not if they're not gonna learn to relax a little. I mean it's 
just gonna be continual nervous time, isn't it, right? Pow, pow, pow, 
when are they next coming at us? Peaceful coexistence is just right 
out, right? Get me some water somebody, thank you." 

He sat back and sipped reflectively. 

"OK," he said, "hear me, hear me. It's, like, these guys, you know, 
are entitled to their own view of the Universe. And according to their 
view, which the Universe forced on them, right, they did right. Sounds 
crazy, but I think you'll agree. They believe in..." 

He consulted a piece of paper which he found in the back pocket of 
his Judicial jeans. 

"They believe in 'peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life, 
and the obliteration of all other life forms'." 

He shrugged. 

"I've heard a lot worse," he said. 

He scratched his crotch reflectively. 

"Freeeow," he said. He took another sip of water, then held it up to 
the light and frowned at it. He twisted it round. 

"Hey, is there something in this water?" he said. 

"Er, no, m'lud," said the Court Usher who had brought it to him, 
rather nervously. 

"Then take it away," snapped Judiciary Pag, "and put something in 
it. I got an idea." 



He pushed away the glass and leaned forward. 

"Hear me, hear me," he said. 

The solution was brilliant, and went like this: 

The planet of Krikkit was to be enclosed for perpetuity in an 
envelope of Slo-Time, inside which life would continue almost 
infinitely slowly. All light would be deflected round the envelope so 
that it would remain invisible and impenetrable. Escape from the 
envelope would be utterly impossible unless it were locked from the 
outside. 

When the rest of the Universe came to its final end, when the 
whole of creation reached its dying fall (this was all, of course, in the 
days before it was known that the end of the Universe would be a 
spectacular catering venture) and life and matter ceased to exist, then 
the planet of Krikkit and its sun would emerge from its Slo-Time 
envelope and continue a solitary existence, such as it craved, in the 
twilight of the Universal void. 

The Lock would be on an asteroid which would slowly orbit the 
envelope. 

The key would be the symbol of the Galaxy - the Wikkit Gate. 

By the time the applause in the court had died down, Judiciary Pag 
was already in the Sens-O-Shower with a rather nice member of the 
jury that he'd slipped a note to half an hour earlier. 



Chapter 13 


Two months later, Zipo Bibrok 5x108 had cut the bottoms off his 
Galactic State jeans, and was spending part of the enormous fee his 
judgments commanded lying on a jewelled beach having Essence of 
Qualactin rubbed into his back by the same rather nice member of 
the jury. She was a Soolfinian girl from beyond the Cloudworlds of 
Yaga. She had skin like lemon silk and was very interested in legal 
bodies. 

"Did you hear the news?" she said. 

"Weeeeelaaaaah!" said Zipo Bibrok 5x108, and you would have had 
to have been there to know exactly why he said this. None of this was 
on the tape of Informational Illusions, and is all based on hearsay. 

"No," he added, when the thing that had made him say 
"Weeeeelaaaaah" had stopped happening. He moved his body round 
slightly to catch the first rays of the third and greatest of primeval 
Vod's three suns which was now creeping over the ludicrously 
beautiful horizon, and the sky now glittered with some of the greatest 
tanning power ever known. 

A fragrant breeze wandered up from the quiet sea, trailed along 
the beach, and drifted back to sea again, wondering where to go next. 
On a mad impulse it went up to the beach again. It drifted back to sea. 

"I hope it isn't good news," muttered Zipo Bibrok 5x108, '"cos I 
don't think I could bear it." 

"Your Krikkit judgment was carried out today," said the girl 
sumptuously. There was no need to say such a straightforward thing 
sumptuously, but she went ahead and did it anyway because it was 
that sort of day. "I heard it on the radio," she said, "when I went back 
to the ship for the oil." 

"Uhuh," muttered Zipo and rested his head back on the jewelled 
sand. 

"Something happened," she said. 

"Mmmm?" 



"Just after the Slo-Time envelope was locked/' she said, and 
paused a moment from rubbing in the Essence of Qualactin, "a Krikkit 
warship which had been missing presumed destroyed turned out to 
be just missing after all. It appeared and tried to seize the Key." 

Zipo sat up sharply. 

"Hey, what?" he said. 

"It's all right," she said in a voice which would have calmed the Big 
Bang down. "Apparently there was a short battle. The Key and the 
warship were disintegrated and blasted into the space-time 
continuum. Apparently they are lost for ever." 

She smiled, and ran a little more Essence of Qualactin on to her 
fingertips. He relaxed and lay back down. 

"Do what you did a moment or two ago," he murmured. 

"That?" she said. 

"No, no," he said, "that." 

She tried again. 

"That?" she asked. 

"Weeeeelaaaaah!" 

Again, you had to be there. 

The fragrant breeze drifted up from the sea again. 

A magician wandered along the beach, but no one needed him. 



Chapter 14 


"Nothing is lost for ever," said Slartibartfast, his face flickering redly 
in the light of the candle which the robot waiter was trying to take 
away, "except for the Cathedral of Chalesm." 

"The what?" said Arthur with a start. 

"The Cathedral of Chalesm," repeated Slartibartfast. "It was during 
the course of my researches at the Campaign for Real Time that I..." 

"The what?" said Arthur again. 

The old man paused and gathered his thoughts, for what he hoped 
would be one last onslaught on his story. The robot waiter moved 
through the space-time matrices in a way which spectacularly 
combined the surly with the obsequious, made a snatch for the 
candle and got it. They had had the bill, had argued convincingly 
about who had had the cannelloni and how many bottles of wine they 
had had, and, as Arthur had been dimly aware, had thereby 
successfully manoeuvred the ship out of subjective space and into a 
parking orbit round a strange planet. The waiter was now anxious to 
complete his part of the charade and clear the bistro. 

"All will become clear," said Slartibartfast. 

"When?" 

"In a minute. Listen. The time streams are now very polluted. 
There's a lot of muck floating about in them, flotsam and jetsam, and 
more and more of it is now being regurgitated into the physical world. 
Eddies in the space-time continuum, you see." 

"So I hear," said Arthur. 

"Look, where are we going?" said Ford, pushing his chair back from 
the table with impatience. "Because I'm eager to get there." 

"We are going," said Slartibartfast in a slow, measured voice, "to 
try to prevent the war robots of Krikkit from regaining the whole of 
the Key they need to unlock the planet of Krikkit from the Slo-Time 
envelope and release the rest of their army and their mad Masters." 



"It's just," said Ford, "that you mentioned a party." 

"I did," said Slartibartfast, and hung his head. 

He realized that it had been a mistake, because the idea seemed to 
exercise a strange and unhealthy fascination on the mind of Ford 
Prefect. The more that Slartibartfast unravelled the dark and tragic 
story of Krikkit and its people, the more Ford Prefect wanted to drink 
a lot and dance with girls. 

The old man felt that he should not have mentioned the party until 
he absolutely had to. But there it was, the fact was out, and Ford 
Prefect had attached himself to it the way an Arcturan Megaleach 
attaches itself to its victim before biting his head off and making off 
with his spaceship. 

"When," said Ford eagerly, "do we get there?" 

"When I've finished telling you why we have to go there." 

"I know why I'm going," said Ford, and leaned back, sticking his 
hands behind his head. He gave one of his smiles which made people 
twitch. 

Slartibartfast had hoped for an easy retirement. 

He had been planning to learn to play the octraventral 
heebiephone - a pleasantly futile task, he knew, because he had the 
wrong number of mouths. 

He had also been planning to write an eccentric and relentlessly 
inaccurate monograph on the subject of equatorial fjords in order to 
set the record wrong about one or two matters he saw as important. 

Instead, he had somehow got talked into doing some part-time 
work for the Campaign for Real Time and had started to take it all 
seriously for the first time in his life. As a result he now found himself 
spending his fast-declining years combating evil and trying to save the 
Galaxy. 

He found it exhausting work and sighed heavily. 

"Listen," he said, "at Camtim..." 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"The Campaign for Real Time, which I will tell you about later. I 
noticed that five pieces of jetsam which had in relatively recent times 
plopped back into existence seemed to correspond to the five pieces 
of the missing Key. Only two I could trace exactly - the Wooden Pillar, 
which appeared on your planet, and the Silver Bail. It seems to be at 



some sort of party. We must go there to retrieve it before the Krikkit 
robots find it, or who knows what may hap?" 

"No," said Ford firmly. "We must go to the party in order to drink a 
lot and dance with girls." 

"But haven't you understood everything I...?" 

"Yes," said Ford, with a sudden and unexpected fierceness, "I've 
understood it all perfectly well. That's why I want to have as many 
drinks and dance with as many girls as possible while there are still 
any left. If everything you've shown us is true..." 

"True? Of course it's true." 

"... then we don't stand a whelk's chance in a supernova." 

"A what?" said Arthur sharply again. Fie had been following the 
conversation doggedly up to this point, and was keen not to lose the 
thread now. 

"A whelk's chance in a supernova," repeated Ford without losing 
momentum. "The..." 

"What's a whelk got to do with a supernova?" said Arthur. 

"It doesn't," said Ford levelly, "stand a chance in one." 

Fie paused to see if the matter was now cleared up. The freshly 
puzzled looks clambering across Arthur's face told him that it wasn't. 

"A supernova," said Ford as quickly and as clearly as he could, "is a 
star which explodes at almost half the speed of light and burns with 
the brightness of a billion suns and then collapses as a super-heavy 
neutron star. It's a star which burns up other stars, got it? Nothing 
stands a chance in a supernova." 

"I see," said Arthur. 

"The..." 

"So why a whelk particularly?" 

"Why not a whelk? Doesn't matter." 

Arthur accepted this, and Ford continued, picking up his early fierce 
momentum as best he could. 

"The point is," he said, "that people like you and me, Slartibartfast, 
and Arthur - particularly and especially Arthur - are just dilletantes, 
eccentrics, layabouts, fartarounds if you like." 

Slartibartfast frowned, partly in puzzlement and partly in umbrage. 
Fie started to speak. 



" - ..." is as far as he got. 

"We're not obsessed by anything, you see," insisted Ford. 

M n 

"And that's the deciding factor. We can't win against obsession. 
They care, we don't. They win." 

"I care about lots of things," said Slartibartfast, his voice trembling 
partly with annoyance, but partly also with uncertainty. 

"Such as?" 

"Well," said the old man, "life, the Universe. Everything, really. 
Fjords." 

"Would you die for them?" 

"Fjords?" blinked Slartibartfast in surprise. "No." 

"Well then." 

"Wouldn't see the point, to be honest." 

"And I still can't see the connection," said Arthur, "with whelks." 

Ford could feel the conversation slipping out of his control, and 
refused to be sidetracked by anything at this point. 

"The point is," he hissed, "that we are not obsessive people, and 
we don't stand a chance against..." 

"Except for your sudden obsession with whelks," pursued Arthur, 
"which I still haven't understood." 

"Will you please leave whelks out of it?" 

"I will if you will," said Arthur. "You brought the subject up." 

"It was an error," said Ford, "forget them. The point is this." 

Fie leant forward and rested his forehead on the tips of his fingers. 

"What was I talking about?" he said wearily. 

"Let's just go down to the party," said Slartibartfast, "for whatever 
reason." Fie stood up, shaking his head. 

"I think that's what I was trying to say," said Ford. 

For some unexplained reason, the teleport cubicles were in the 
bathroom. 



Chapter 15 


Time travel is increasingly regarded as a menace. History is being 
polluted. 

The Encyclopedia Galactica has much to say on the theory and 
practice of time travel, most of which is incomprehensible to anyone 
who hasn't spent at least four lifetimes studying advanced 
hypermathematics, and since it was impossible to do this before time 
travel was invented, there is a certain amount of confusion as to how 
the idea was arrived at in the first place. One rationalization of this 
problem states that time travel was, by its very nature, discovered 
simultaneously at all periods of history, but this is clearly bunk. 

The trouble is that a lot of history is now quite clearly bunk as well. 

Here is an example. It may not seem to be an important one to 
some people, but to others it is crucial. It is certainly significant in that 
it was the single event which caused the Campaign for Real Time to 
be set up in the first place (or is it last? It depends which way round 
you see history as happening, and this too is now an increasingly 
vexed question). 

There is, or was, a poet. His name was Lallafa, and he wrote what 
are widely regarded throughout the Galaxy as being the finest poems 
in existence, the Songs of the Long Land. 

They are/were unspeakably wonderful. That is to say, you couldn't 
speak very much of them at once without being so overcome with 
emotion, truth and a sense of wholeness and oneness of things that 
you wouldn't pretty soon need a brisk walk round the block, possibly 
pausing at a bar on the way back for a quick glass of perspective and 
soda. They were that good. 

Lallafa had lived in the forests of the Long Lands of Effa. He lived 
there, and he wrote his poems there. He wrote them on pages made 
of dried habra leaves, without the benefit of education or correcting 
fluid. He wrote about the light in the forest and what he thought 
about that. He wrote about the darkness in the forest, and what he 



thought about that. He wrote about the girl who had left him and 
precisely what he thought about that. 

Long after his death his poems were found and wondered over. 
News of them spread like morning sunlight. For centuries they 
illuminated and watered the lives of many people whose lives might 
otherwise have been darker and drier. 

Then, shortly after the invention of time travel, some major 
correcting fluid manufacturers wondered whether his poems might 
have been better still if he had had access to some high-quality 
correcting fluid, and whether he might be persuaded to say a few 
words on that effect. 

They travelled the time waves, they found him, they explained the 
situation - with some difficulty - to him, and did indeed persuade him. 
In fact they persuaded him to such an effect that he became 
extremely rich at their hands, and the girl about whom he was 
otherwise destined to write which such precision never got around to 
leaving him, and in fact they moved out of the forest to a rather nice 
pad in town and he frequently commuted to the future to do chat 
shows, on which he sparkled wittily. 

He never got around to writing the poems, of course, which was a 
problem, but an easily solved one. The manufacturers of correcting 
fluid simply packed him off for a week somewhere with a copy of a 
later edition of his book and a stack of dried habra leaves to copy 
them out on to, making the odd deliberate mistake and correction on 
the way. 

Many people now say that the poems are suddenly worthless. 
Others argue that they are exactly the same as they always were, so 
what's changed? The first people say that that isn't the point. They 
aren't quite sure what the point is, but they are quite sure that that 
isn't it. They set up the Campaign for Real Time to try to stop this sort 
of thing going on. Their case was considerably strengthened by the 
fact that a week after they had set themselves up, news broke that 
not only had the great Cathedral of Chalesm been pulled down in 
order to build a new ion refinery, but that the construction of the 
refinery had taken so long, and had had to extend so far back into the 
past in order to allow ion production to start on time, that the 
Cathedral of Chalesm had now never been built in the first place. 



Picture postcards of the cathedral suddenly became immensely 
valuable. 

So a lot of history is now gone for ever. The Campaign for Real 
Timers claim that just as easy travel eroded the differences between 
one country and another, and between one world and another, so 
time travel is now eroding the differences between one age and 
another. "The past," they say, "is now truly like a foreign country. 
They do things exactly the same there." 



Chapter 16 


Arthur materialized, and did so with all the customary staggering 
about and clasping at his throat, heart and various limbs which he still 
indulged himself in whenever he made any of these hateful and 
painful materializations that he was determined not to let himself get 
used to. 

He looked around for the others. 

They weren't there. 

He looked around for the others again. 

They still weren't there. 

He closed his eyes. 

He opened them 

He looked around for the others. 

They obstinately persisted in their absence. 

He closed his eyes again, preparatory to making this completely 
futile exercise once more, and because it was only then, whilst his 
eyes were closed, that his brain began to register what his eyes had 
been looking at whilst they were open, a puzzled frown crept across 
his face. 

So he opened his eyes again to check his facts and the frown stayed 
put. 

If anything, it intensified, and got a good firm grip. If this was a 
party it was a very bad one, so bad, in fact, that everybody else had 
left. He abandoned this line of thought as futile. Obviously this wasn't 
a party. It was a cave, or a labyrinth, or a tunnel of something - there 
was insufficient light to tell. All was darkness, a damp shiny darkness. 
The only sounds were the echoes of his own breathing, which 
sounded worried. He coughed very slightly, and then had to listen to 
the thin ghostly echo of his cough trailing away amongst winding 
corridors and sightless chambers, as of some great labyrinth, and 



eventually returning to him via the same unseen corridors, as if to 
say... "Yes?" 

This happened to every slightest noise he made, and it unnerved 
him. He tried to hum a cheery tune, but by the time it returned to him 
it was a hollow dirge and he stopped. 

His mind was suddenly full of images from the story that 
Slartibartfast had been telling him. He half-expected suddenly to see 
lethal white robots step silently from the shadows and kill him. He 
caught his breath. They didn't. He let it go again. He didn't know what 
he did expect. 

Someone or something, however, seemed to be expecting him, for 
at that moment there lit up suddenly in the dark distance an eerie 
green neon sign. 

It said, silently: 

YOU HAVE BEEN DIVERTED 

The sign flicked off again, in a way which Arthur was not at all 
certain he liked. It flicked off with a sort of contemptuous flourish. 
Arthur then tried to assure himself that this was just a ridiculous trick 
of his imagination. A neon sign is either on or off, depending on 
whether it has electricity running through it or not. There was no way, 
he told himself, that it could possibly effect the transition from one 
state to the other with a contemptuous flourish. He hugged himself 
tightly in his dressing gown and shivered, nevertheless. 

The neon sign in the depths now suddenly lit up, bafflingly, with 
just three dots and a comma. Like this: 

• • v 

Only in green neon. 

It was trying, Arthur realized after staring at this perplexedly for a 
second or two, to indicate that there was more to come, that the 
sentence was not complete. Trying with almost superhuman pedantry, 
he reflected. Or at least, inhuman pedantry. 

The sentence then completed itself with these two words: 

ARTHUR DENT. 

He reeled. He steadied himself to have another clear look at it. It 
still said ARTHUR DENT, so he reeled again. 



Once again, the sign flicked off, and left him blinking in the 
darkness with just the dim red image of his name jumping on his 
retina. 

WELCOME, the sign now suddenly said. 

After a moment, it added: 

I DON'T THINK. 

The stone-cold fear which had been hovering about Arthur all this 
time, waiting for its moment, recognized that its moment had now 
come and pounced on him. He tried to fight it off. He dropped into a 
kind of alert crouch that he had once seen somebody do on television, 
but it must have been someone with stronger knees. He peered 
huntedly into the darkness. 

"Er, hello?" he said. 

He cleared his throat and said it again, more loudly and without the 
"er". At some distance down the corridor it seemed suddenly as if 
somebody started to beat on a bass drum. 

He listened to it for a few seconds and realized that it was just his 
heart beating. 

He listened for a few seconds more and realized that it wasn't his 
heart beating, it was somebody down the corridor beating on a bass 
drum. 

Beads of sweat formed on his brow, tensed themselves, and leapt 
off. He put a hand out on the floor to steady his alert crouch, which 
wasn't holding up very well. The sign changed itself again. It said: 

DO NOT BEALARMED. 

After a pause, it added: 

BE VERY VERY FRIGHTENED, ARTHUR DENT. 

Once again it flicked off. Once again it left him in darkness. His eyes 
seemed to be popping out of his head. He wasn't certain if this was 
because they were trying to see more clearly, or if they simply wanted 
to leave at this point. 

"Hello?" he said again, this time trying to put a note of rugged and 
aggressive self-assertion into it. "Is anyone there?" 

There was no reply, nothing. 

This unnerved Arthur Dent even more than a reply would have 
done, and he began to back away from the scary nothingness. And 



the more he backed away, the more scared he became. After a while 
he realized that the reason for this was because of all the films he had 
seen in which the hero backs further and further away from some 
imagined terror in front of him, only to bump into it coming up from 
behind. 

Just then it suddenly occurred to him to turn round rather quickly. 

There was nothing there. 

Just blackness. 

This really unnerved him, and he started to back away from that, 
back the way he had come. 

After doing this for a short while it suddenly occurred to him that 
he was now backing towards whatever it was he had been backing 
away from in the first place. 

This, he couldn't help thinking, must be a foolish thing to do. He 
decided he would be better off backing the way he had first been 
backing, and turned around again. 

It turned out at this point that his second impulse had been the 
correct one, because there was an indescribably hideous monster 
standing quietly behind him. Arthur yawed wildly as his skin tried to 
jump one way and his skeleton the other, whilst his brain tried to 
work out which of his ears it most wanted to crawl out of. 

"Bet you weren't expecting to see me again," said the monster, 
which Arthur couldn't help thinking was a strange remark for it to 
make, seeing as he had never met the creature before. He could tell 
that he hadn't met the creature before from the simple fact that he 
was able to sleep at nights. It was... it was... it was... 

Arthur blinked at it. It stood very still. It did look a little familiar. 

A terrible cold calm came over him as he realized that what he was 
looking at was a six-foot-high hologram of a housefly. 

He wondered why anybody would be showing him a six-foot-high 
hologram of a housefly at this time. He wondered whose voice he had 
heard. 

It was a terribly realistic hologram. 

It vanished. 

"Or perhaps you remember me better," said the voice suddenly, 
and it was a deep, hollow malevolent voice which sounded like 



molten tar glurping out of a drum with evil on its mind, "as the 
rabbit." 

With a sudden ping, there was a rabbit there in the black labyrinth 
with him, a huge, monstrously, hideously soft and lovable rabbit - an 
image again, but one on which every single soft and lovable hair 
seemed like a real and single thing growing in its soft and lovable coat. 
Arthur was startled to see his own reflection in its soft and lovable 
unblinking and extremely huge brown eyes. 

"Born in darkness," rumbled the voice, "raised in darkness. One 
morning I poked my head for the first time into the bright new world 
and got it split open by what felt suspiciously like some primitive 
instrument made of flint. 

"Made by you, Arthur Dent, and wielded by you. Rather hard as I 
recall. 

"You turned my skin into a bag for keeping interesting stones in. I 
happen to know that because in my next life I came back as a fly again 
and you swatted me. Again. Only this time you swatted me with the 
bag you'd made of my previous skin. 

"Arthur Dent, you are not merely a cruel and heartless man, you 
are also staggeringly tactless." 

The voice paused whilst Arthur gawped. 

"I see you have lost the bag," said the voice. "Probably got bored 
with it, did you?" 

Arthur shook his head helplessly. He wanted to explain that he had 
been in fact very fond of the bag and had looked after it very well and 
had taken it with him wherever he went, but that somehow every 
time he travelled anywhere he seemed inexplicably to end up with 
the wrong bag and that, curiously enough, even as they stood there 
he was just noticing for the first time that the bag he had with him at 
the moment appeared to be made out of rather nasty fake leopard 
skin, and wasn't the one he'd had a few moments ago before he 
arrived in this whatever place it was, and wasn't one he would have 
chosen himself and heaven knew what would be in it as it wasn't his, 
and he would much rather have his original bag back, except that he 
was of course terribly sorry for having so peremptorily removed it, or 
rather its component parts, i.e. the rabbit skin, from its previous 
owner, viz. the rabbit whom he currently had the honour of 
attempting vainly to address. 



All he actually managed to say was "Erp". 

"Meet the newt you trod on," said the voice. 

And there was, standing in the corridor with Arthur, a giant green 
scaly newt. Arthur turned, yelped, leapt backwards, and found himself 
standing in the middle of the rabbit. He yelped again, but could find 
nowhere to leap to. 

"That was me, too," continued the voice in a low menacing rumble, 
"as if you didn't know..." 

"Know?" said Arthur with a start. "Know?" 

"The interesting thing about reincarnation," rasped the voice, "is 
that most people, most spirits, are not aware that it is happening to 
them." 

He paused for effect. As far as Arthur was concerned there was 
already quite enough effect going on. 

"I was aware," hissed the voice, "that is, I became aware. Slowly. 
Gradually." 

He, whoever he was, paused again and gathered breath. 

"I could hardly help it, could I?" he bellowed, "when the same thing 
kept happening, over and over and over again! Every life I ever lived, I 
got killed by Arthur Dent. Any world, any body, any time, I'm just 
getting settled down, along comes Arthur Dent - pow, he kills me. 

"Hard not to notice. Bit of a memory jogger. Bit of a pointer. Bit of 
a bloody giveaway! 

"'That's funny,' my spirit would say to itself as it winged its way 
back to the netherworld after another fruitless Dent-ended venture 
into the land of the living, 'that man who just ran over me as I was 
hopping across the road to my favourite pond looked a little 
familiar...' And gradually I got to piece it together. Dent, you multiple- 
me-murderer!" 

The echoes of his voice roared up and down the corridors. Arthur 
stood silent and cold, his head shaking with disbelief. 

"Here's the moment. Dent," shrieked the voice, now reaching a 
feverish pitch of hatred, "here's the moment when at last I knew!" 

It was indescribably hideous, the thing that suddenly opened up in 
front of Arthur, making him gasp and gargle with horror, but here's an 
attempt at a description of how hideous it was. It was a huge 
palpitating wet cave with a vast, slimy, rough, whale-like creature 



rolling around it and sliding over monstrous white tombstones. High 
above the cave rose a vast promontory in which could be seen the 
dark recesses of two further fearful caves, which... 

Arthur Dent suddenly realized that he was looking at his own 
mouth, when his attention was meant to be directed at the live oyster 
that was being tipped helplessly into it. 

He staggered back with a cry and averted his eyes. 

When he looked again the appalling apparition had gone. The 
corridor was dark and, briefly, silent. He was alone with his thoughts. 
They were extremely unpleasant thoughts and would rather have had 
a chaperone. 

The next noise, when it came, was the low heavy roll of a large 
section of wall trundling aside, revealing, for the moment, just dark 
blackness behind it. Arthur looked into it in much the same way that a 
mouse looks into a dark dog-kennel. 

And the voice spoke to him again. 

"Tell me it was a coincidence, Dent," it said. "I dare you to tell me it 
was a coincidence!" 

"It was a coincidence," said Arthur quickly. 

"It was not!" came the answering bellow. 

"It was," said Arthur, "it was..." 

"If it was a coincidence, then my name," roared the voice, "is not 
Agrajag!!!" 

"And presumably," said Arthur, "you would claim that that was 
your name." 

"Yes!" hissed Agrajag, as if he had just completed a rather deft 
syllogism. 

"Well, I'm afraid it was still a coincidence," said Arthur. 

"Come in here and say that!" howled the voice, in sudden apoplexy 
again. 

Arthur walked in and said that it was a coincidence, or at least, he 
nearly said that it was a coincidence. His tongue rather lost its footing 
towards the end of the last word because the lights came up and 
revealed what it was he had walked into. 


It was a Cathedral of Hate. 



It was the product of a mind that was not merely twisted, but 
actually sprained. 

It was huge. It was horrific. 

It had a Statue in it. 

We will come to the Statue in a moment. 

The vast, incomprehensibly vast chamber looked as if it had been 
carved out of the inside of a mountain, and the reason for this was 
that that was precisely what it had been carved out of. It seemed to 
Arthur to spin sickeningly round his head as he stood and gaped at it. 

It was black. 

Where it wasn't black you were inclined to wish that it was, 
because the colours with which some of the unspeakable details were 
picked out ranged horribly across the whole spectrum of eye-defying 
colours from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead, taking in Liver Purple, 
Loathsome Lilac, Matter Yellow, Burnt hombre and Gan Green on the 
way. 

The unspeakable details which these colours picked out were 
gargoyles which would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch. 

The gargoyles all looked inwards from the walls, from the pillars, 
from the flying buttresses, from the choir stalls, towards the Statue, 
to which we will come in a moment. 

And if the gargoyles would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch, 
then it was clear from the gargoyles' faces that the Statue would have 
put them off theirs, had they been alive to eat it, which they weren't, 
and had anybody tried to serve them some, which they wouldn't. 

Around the monumental walls were vast engraved stone tablets in 
memory of those who had fallen to Arthur Dent. 

The names of some of those commemorated were underlined and 
had asterisks against them. So, for instance, the name of a cow which 
had been slaughtered and of which Arthur Dent had happened to eat 
a fillet steak would have the plainest engraving, whereas the name of 
a fish which Arthur had himself caught and then decided he didn't like 
and left on the side of the plate had a double underlining, three sets 
of asterisks and a bleeding dagger added as decoration, just to make 
the point. 

And what was most disturbing about all this, apart from the Statue, 
to which we are, by degrees, coming, was the very clear implication 



that all these people and creatures were indeed the same person, 
over and over again. 

And it was equally clear that this person was, however u nfairly, 
extremely upset and annoyed. 

In fact it would be fair to say that he had reached a level of 
annoyance the like of which had never been seen in the Universe. It 
was an annoyance of epic proportions, a burning searing flame of 
annoyance, an annoyance which now spanned the whole of time and 
space in its infinite umbrage. 

And this annoyance had been given its fullest expression in the 
Statue in the centre of all this monstrosity, which was a statue of 
Arthur Dent, and an unflattering one. Fifty feet tall if it was an inch, 
there was not an inch of it which wasn't crammed with insult to its 
subject matter, and fifty feet of that sort of thing would be enough to 
make any subject feel bad. From the small pimple on the side of his 
nose to the poorish cut of his dressing gown, there was no aspect of 
Arthur Dent which wasn't lambasted and vilified by the sculptor. 

Arthur appeared as a gorgon, an evil, rapacious, ravenning, 
bloodied ogre, slaughtering his way through an innocent one-man 
Universe. 

With each of the thirty arms which the sculptor in a fit of artistic 
fervour had decided to give him, he was either braining a rabbit, 
swatting a fly, pulling a wishbone, picking a flea out of his hair, or 
doing something which Arthur at first looking couldn't quite identify. 

His many feet were mostly stamping on ants. 

Arthur put his hands over his eyes, hung his head and shook it 
slowly from side to side in sadness and horror at the craziness of 
things. 

And when he opened his eyes again, there in front of him stood the 
figure of the man or creature, or whatever it was, that he had 
supposedly been persecuting all this time. 

"HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!" said Agrajag. 

Fie, or it, or whatever, looked like a mad fat bat. Fie waddled slowly 
around Arthur, and poked at him with bent claws. 


"Look...!" protested Arthur. 



"HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHHM!" explained Agrajag, and Arthur 
reluctantly accepted this on the grounds that he was rather 
frightened by this hideous and strangely wrecked apparition. 

Agrajag was black, bloated, wrinkled and leathery. 

His batwings were somehow more frightening for being the 
pathetic broken floundering things they were that if they had been 
strong, muscular beaters of the air. The frightening thing was 
probably the tenacity of his continued existence against all the 
physical odds. 

He had the most astounding collection of teeth. 

They looked as if they each came from a completely different 
animal, and they were ranged around his mouth at such bizarre 
angles it seemed that if he ever actually tried to chew anything he'd 
lacerate half his own face along with it, and possibly put an eye out as 
well. 

Each of his three eyes was small and intense and looked about as 
sane as a fish in a privet bush. 

"I was at a cricket match," he rasped. 

This seemed on the face of it such a preposterous notion that 
Arthur practically choked. 

"Not in this body," screeched the creature, "not in this body! This is 
my last body. My last life. This is my revenge body. My kill-Arthur- 
Dent body. My last chance. I had to fight to get it, too." 

"But..." 

"I was at," roared Agrajag, "a cricket match! I had a weak heart 
condition, but what, I said to my wife, can happen to me at a cricket 
match? As I'm watching, what happens? 

"Two people quite maliciously appear out of thin air just in front of 
me. The last thing I can't help but notice before my poor heart gives 
out in shock is that one of them is Arthur Dent wearing a rabbit bone 
in his beard. Coincidence?" 

"Yes," said Arthur. 

"Coincidence?" screamed the creature, painfully thrashing its 
broken wings, and opening a short gash on its right cheek with a 
particularly nasty tooth. On closer examination, such as he'd been 
hoping to avoid, Arthur noticed that much of Agrajag's face was 
covered with ragged strips of black sticky plasters. 



He backed away nervously. He tugged at his beard. He was 
appalled to discover that in fact he still had the rabbit bone in it. He 
pulled it out and threw it away. 

"Look," he said, "it's just fate playing silly buggers with you. With 
me. With us. It's a complete coincidence." 

"What have you got against me. Dent?" snarled the creature, 
advancing on him in a painful waddle. 

"Nothing," insisted Arthur, "honestly, nothing." 

Agrajag fixed him with a beady stare. 

"Seems a strange way to relate to somebody you've got nothing 
against, killing them all the time. Very curious piece of social 
interaction, I would call that. I'd also call it a lie!" 

"But look," said Arthur, "I'm very sorry. There's been a terrible 
misunderstanding. I've got to go. Have you got a clock? I'm meant to 
be helping save the Universe." He backed away still further. 

Agrajag advanced still further. 

"At one point," he hissed, "at one point, I decided to give up. Yes, I 
would not come back. I would stay in the netherworld. And what 
happened?" 

Arthur indicated with random shakes of his head that he had no 
idea and didn't want to have one either. He found he had backed up 
against the cold dark stone that had been carved by who knew what 
Herculean effort into a monstrous travesty of his bedroom slippers. 

He glanced up at his own horrendously parodied image towering 
above him. He was still puzzled as to what one of his hands was 
meant to be doing. 

"I got yanked involuntarily back into the physical world," pursued 
Agrajag, "as a bunch of petunias. In, I might add, a bowl. This 
particularly happy little lifetime started off with me, in my bowl, 
unsupported, three hundred miles above the surface of a particularly 
grim planet. Not a naturally tenable position for a bowl of petunias, 
you might think. And you'd be right. That life ended a very short while 
later, three hundred miles lower. In, I might add, the fresh wreckage 
of a whale. My spirit brother." 

He leered at Arthur with renewed hatred. 



"On the way down," he snarled, "I couldn't help noticing a flashy- 
looking white spaceship. And looking out of a port on this flashy- 
looking spaceship was a smug-looking Arthur Dent. Coincidence?!!" 

"Yes!" yelped Arthur. He glanced up again, and realized that the 
arm that had puzzled him was represented as wantonly calling into 
existence a bowl of doomed petunias. This was not a concept which 
leapt easily to the eye. 

"I must go," insisted Arthur. 

"You may go," said Agrajag, "after I have killed you." 

"No, that won't be any use," explained Arthur, beginning to climb 
up the hard stone incline of his carved slipper, "because I have to save 
the Universe, you see. I have to find a Silver Bail, that's the point. 
Tricky thing to do dead." 

"Save the Universe!" spat Agrajag with contempt. "You should have 
thought of that before you started your vendetta against me! What 
about the time you were on Stavromula Beta and someone..." 

"I've never been there," said Arthur. 

"... tried to assassinate you and you ducked. Who do you think the 
bullet hit? What did you say?" 

"Never been there," repeated Arthur. "What are you talking about? 
I have to go." 

Agrajag stopped in his tracks. 

"You must have been there. You were responsible for my death 
there, as everywhere else. An innocent bystander!" He quivered. 

"I've never heard of the place," insisted Arthur. "I've certainly never 
had anyone try to assassinate me. Other than you. Perhaps I go there 
later, do you think?" 

Agrajag blinked slowly in a kind of frozen logical horror. 

"You haven't been to Stavromula Beta... yet?" he whispered. 

"No," said Arthur, "I don't know anything about the place. Certainly 
never been to it, and don't have any plans to go." 

"Oh, you go there all right," muttered Agrajag in a broken voice, 
"you go there all right. Oh zark!" he tottered, and stared wildly about 
him at his huge Cathedral of Hate. "I've brought you here too soon!" 

He started to scream and bellow. "I've brought you here too 
zarking soon!" 



Suddenly he rallied, and turned a baleful, hating eye on Arthur. 

"I'm going to kill you anyway!" he roared. "Even if it's a logical 
impossibility I'm going to zarking well try! I'm going to blow this whole 
mountain up!" He screamed, "Let's see you get out of this one, Dent!" 

He rushed in a painful waddling hobble to what appeared to be a 
small black sacrificial altar. He was shouting so wildly now that he was 
really carving his face up badly. Arthur leaped down from his vantage 
place on the carving of his own foot and ran to try to restrain the 
three-quarters-crazed creature. 

He leaped upon him, and brought the strange monstrosity crashing 
down on top of the altar. 

Agrajag screamed again, thrashed wildly for a brief moment, and 
turned a wild eye on Arthur. 

"You know what you've done?" he gurgled painfully. "You've only 
gone and killed me again. I mean, what do you want from me, 
blood?" 

He thrashed again in a brief apoplectic fit, quivered, and collapsed, 
smacking a large red button on the altar as he did so. 

Arthur started with horror and fear, first at what he appeared to 
have done, and then at the loud sirens and bells that suddenly 
shattered the air to announce some clamouring emergency. He stared 
wildly around him. 

The only exit appeared to be the way he came in. He pelted 
towards it, throwing away the nasty fake leopard-skin bag as he did so. 

He dashed randomly, haphazardly through the labyrinthine maze, 
he seemed to be pursued more and more fiercely by claxons, sirens, 
flashing lights. 

Suddenly, he turned a corner and there was a light in front of him. 

It wasn't flashing. It was daylight. 



Chapter 17 


Although it has been said that on Earth alone in our Galaxy is 
Krikkit (or cricket) treated as fit subject for a game, and that for this 
reason the Earth has been shunned, this does only apply to our 
Galaxy, and more specifically to our dimension. In some of the higher 
dimensions they feel they can more or less please themselves, and 
have been playing a peculiar game called Brockian Ultra-Cricket for 
whatever their transdimensional equivalent of billions of years is. 

"Let's be blunt, it's a nasty game" (says The Hitchhiker's Guide to 
the Galaxy) "but then anyone who has been to any of the higher 
dimensions will know that they're a pretty nasty heathen lot up there 
who should just be smashed and done in, and would be, too, if 
anyone could work out a way of firing missiles at right-angles to 
reality." 

This is another example of the fact that The Hitchhiker's Guide to 
the Galaxy will employ anybody who wants to walk straight in off the 
street and get ripped off, especially if they happen to walk in off the 
street during the afternoon, when very few of the regular staff are 
there. 

There is a fundamental point here. 

The history of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of 
idealism, struggle, despair, passion, success, failure, and enormously 
long lunch-breaks. 

The earliest origins of the Guide are now, along with most of its 
financial records, lost in the mists of time. 

For other, and more curious theories about where they are lost, 
see below. 

Most of the surviving stories, however, speak of a founding editor 
called Hurling Frootmig. 

Hurling Frootmig, it is said, founded the Guide, established its 
fundamental principles of honesty and idealism, and went bust. 



There followed many years of penury and heart - searching during 
which he consulted friends, sat in darkened rooms in illegal states of 
mind, thought about this and that, fooled about with weights, and 
then, after a chance encounter with the Holy Lunching Friars of 
Voondon (who claimed that just as lunch was at the centre of a man's 
temporal day, and man's temporal day could be seen as an analogy 
for his spiritual life, so Lunch should 

(a) be seen as the centre of a man's spiritual life, and 

(b) be held in jolly nice restaurants), he refounded the Guide, laid 
down its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and where 
you could stuff them both, and led the Guide on to its first major 
commercial success. 

He also started to develop and explore the role of the editorial 
lunch-break which was subsequently to play such a crucial part in the 
Guide's history, since it meant that most of the actual work got done 
by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the empty 
offices on an afternoon and saw something worth doing. 

Shortly after this, the Guide was taken over by Megadodo 
Publications of Ursa Minor Beta, thus putting the whole thing on a 
very sound financial footing, and allowing the fourth editor, Lig Lury Jr, 
to embark on lunch-breaks of such breathtaking scope that even the 
efforts of recent editors, who have started undertaking sponsored 
lunch-breaks for charity, seem like mere sandwiches in comparison. 

In fact, Lig never formally resigned his editorship - he merely left 
his office late one morning and has never since returned. Though well 
over a century has now passed, many members of the Guide staff still 
retain the romantic notion that he has simply popped out for a ham 
croissant, and will yet return to put in a solid afternoon's work. 

Strictly speaking, all editors since Lig Lury Jr have therefore been 
designated Acting Editors, and Lig's desk is still preserved the way he 
left it, with the addition of a small sign which says "LIG LURY JR, 
EDITOR, MISSING, PRESUMED FED". 

Some very scurrilous and subversive sources hint at the idea that 
Lig actually perished in the Guide's first extraordinary experiments in 
alternative book-keeping. Very little is known of this, and less still said. 
Anyone who even notices, let alone calls attention to, the curious but 
utter coincidental and meaningless fact that every world on which the 
Guide has ever set up an accounting department has shortly 



afterwards perished in warfare or some natural disaster, is liable to 
get sued to smithereens. 

It is an interesting though utterly unrelated fact that the two or 
three days prior to the demolition of the planet Earth to make way for 
a new hyperspace bypass saw a dramatic upsurge in the number of 
UFO sightings there, not only above Lords Cricket Ground in St. John's 
Wood, London, but also above Glastonbury in Somerset. 

Glastonbury had long been associated with myths of ancient kings, 
witchcraft, ley-lines an wart curing, and had now been selected as the 
site for the new Hitchhiker's Guide financial records office, and indeed, 
ten years' worth of financial records were transferred to a magic hill 
just outside the city mere hours before the Vogons arrived. 

None of these facts, however strange or inexplicable, is as strange 
or inexplicable as the rules of the game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket, as 
played in the higher dimensions. A full set of rules is so massively 
complicated that the only time they were all bound together in a 
single volume, they underwent gravitational collapse and became a 
Black Hole. 

A brief summary, however, is as follows: 

Rule One: Grow at least three extra legs. You won't need them, but 
it keeps the crowds amused. 

Rule Two: Find one good Brockian Ultra-Cricket player. Clone him 
off a few times. This saves an enormous amount of tedious selection 
and training. 

Rule Three: Put your team and the opposing team in a large field 
and build a high wall round them. 

The reason for this is that, though the game is a major spectator 
sport, the frustration experienced by the audience at not actually 
being able to see what's going on leads them to imagine that it's a lot 
more exciting than it really is. A crowd that has just watched a rather 
humdrum game experiences far less life-affirmation than a crowd that 
believes it has just missed the most dramatic event in sporting history. 

Rule Four: Throw lots of assorted items of sporting equipment over 
the wall for the players. Anything will do - cricket bats, basecube bats, 
tennis guns, skis, anything you can get a good swing with. 

Rule Five: The players should now lay about themselves for all they 
are worth with whatever they find to hand. Whenever a player scores 



a "hit" on another player, he should immediately run away and 
apologize from a safe distance. 

Apologies should be concise, sincere and, for maximum clarity and 
points, delivered through a megaphone. 

Rule Six: The winning team shall be the first team that wins. 

Curiously enough, the more the obsession with the game grows in 
the higher dimensions, the less it is actually played, since most of the 
competing teams are now in a state of permanent warfare with each 
other over the interpretation of these rules. This is all for the best, 
because in the long run a good solid war is less psychologically 
damaging than a protracted game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket. 



Chapter 18 


As Arthur ran darting, dashing and panting down the side of the 
mountain he suddenly felt the whole bulk of the mountain move very, 
very slightly beneath him. There was a rumble, a roar, and a slight 
blurred movement, and a lick of heat in the distance behind and 
above him. He ran in a frenzy of fear. The land began to slide, and he 
suddenly felt the force of the word "landslide" in a way which had 
never been apparent to him before. It had always just been a word to 
him, but now he was suddenly and horribly aware that sliding is a 
strange and sickening thing for land to do. It was doing it with him on 
it. He felt ill with fear and shaking. The ground slid, the mountain 
slurred, he slipped, he fell, he stood, he slipped again and ran. The 
avalance began. 

Stones, then rocks, then boulders which pranced past him like 
clumsy puppies, only much, much bigger, much, much harder and 
heavier, and almost infinitely more likely to kill you if they fell on you. 
His eyes danced with them, his feet danced with the dancing ground. 
He ran as if running was a terrible sweating sickness, his heart 
pounded to the rhythm of the pounding geological frenzy around him. 

The logic of the situation, i.e. that he was clearly bound to survive if 
the next foreshadowed incident in the saga of his inadvertent 
persecution of Agrajag was to happen, was utterly failing to impinge 
itself on his mind or exercise any restraining influence on him at this 
time. He ran with the fear of death in him, under him, over him and 
grabbing hold of his hair. 

And suddenly he tripped again and was hurled forward by his 
considerable momentum. But just at the moment that he was about 
to hit the ground astoundingly hard he saw lying directly in front of 
him a small navy-blue holdall that he knew for a fact he had lost in the 
baggage-retrieval system at Athens airport some ten years in his 
personal time-scale previously, and in his astonishment he missed the 
ground completely and bobbed off into the air with his brain singing. 



What he was doing was this: he was flying. He glanced around him 
in surprise, but there could be no doubt that that was what he was 
doing. No part of him was touching the ground, and no part of him 
was even approaching it. He was simply floating there with boulders 
hurtling through the air around him. 

He could now do something about that. Blinking with the non¬ 
effort of it he wafted higher into the air, and now the boulders were 
hurtling through the air beneath him. 

He looked downwards with intense curiosity. Between him and the 
shivering ground were now some thirty feet of empty air, empty that 
is if you discounted the boulders which didn't stay in it for long, but 
bounded downwards in the iron grip of the law of gravity; the same 
law which seemed, all of a sudden, to have given Arthur a sabbatical. 

It occurred to him almost instantly, with the instinctive correctness 
that self-preservation instils in the mind, that he mustn't try to think 
about it, that if he did, the law of gravity would suddenly glance 
sharply in his direction and demand to know what the hell he thought 
he was doing up there, and all would suddenly be lost. 

So he thought about tulips. It was difficult, but he did. He thought 
about the pleasing firm roundness of the bottom of tulips, he thought 
about the interesting variety of colours they came in, and wondered 
what proportion of the total number of tulips that grew, or had grown, 
on the Earth would be found within a radius of one mile from a 
windmill. After a while he got dangerously bored with this train of 
thought, felt the air slipping away beneath him, felt that he was 
drifting down into the paths of the bouncing boulders that he was 
trying so hard not to think about, so he thought about Athens airport 
for a bit and that kept him usefully annoyed for about five minutes - 
at the end of which he was startled to discover that he was now 
floating about two hundred yards above the ground. 

He wondered for a moment how he was going to get back down to 
it, but instantly shied away from that area of speculation again, and 
tried to look at the situation steadily. 

He was flying, What was he going to do about it? He looked back 
down at the ground. He didn't look at it hard, but did his best just to 
give it an idle glance, as it were, in passing. There were a couple of 
things he couldn't help noticing. One was that the eruption of the 
mountain seemed now to have spent itself - there was a crater just a 



little way beneath the peak, presumably where the rock had caved in 
on top of the huge cavernous cathedral, the statue of himself, and the 
sadly abused figure of Agrajag. 

The other was his hold-all, the one he had lost at Athens airport. It 
was sitting pertly on a piece of clear ground, surrounded by 
exhausted boulders but apparently hit by none of them. Why this 
should be he could not speculate, but since this mystery was 
completely overshadowed by the monstrous impossibility of the bag's 
being there in the first place, it was not a speculation he really felt 
strong enough for anyway. The thing is, it was there. And the nasty, 
fake leopard-skin bag seemed to have disappeared, which was all to 
the good, if not entirely to the explicable. 

He was faced with the fact that he was going to have to pick the 
thing up. Here he was, flying along two hundred yards above the 
surface of an alien planet the name of which he couldn't even 
remember. He could not ignore the plaintive posture of this tiny piece 
of what used to be his life, here, so many light-years from the 
pulverized remains of his home. 

Furthermore, he realized, the bag, if it was still in the state in which 
he lost it, would contain a can which would have in it the only Greek 
olive oil still surviving in the Universe. 

Slowly, carefully, inch by inch, he began to bob downwards, 
swinging gently from side to side like a nervous sheet of paper feeling 
its way towards the ground. 

It went well, he was feeling good. The air supported him, but let 
him through. Two minutes later he was hovering a mere two feet 
above the bag, and was faced with some difficult decision. He bobbed 
there lightly. He frowned, but again, as lightly as he could. 

If he picked the bag up, could he carry it? Mightn't the extra weight 
just pull him straight to the ground? 

Mightn't the mere act of touching something on the ground 
suddenly discharge whatever mysterious force it was that was holding 
him in the air? 

Mightn't he be better off just being sensible at this point and 
stepping out of the air, back on to the ground for a moment or two? 

If he did, would he ever be able to fly again? 



The sensation, when he allowed himself to be aware of it, was so 
quietly ecstatic that he could not bear the thought of losing it, 
perhaps for ever. With this worry in mind he bobbed upwards a little 
again, just to try the feel of it, the surprising and effortless movement 
of it. He bobbed, he floated. He tried a little swoop. 

The swoop was terrific. With his arms spread out in front of him, 
his hair and dressing gown streaming out behind him, he dived down 
out of the sky, bellied along a body of air about two feet from the 
ground and swung back up again, catching himself at the top of the 
swing and holding. Just holding. He stayed there. 

It was wonderful. 

And that, he realized, was the way of picking up the bag. He would 
swoop down and catch hold of it just at the point of the upswing. He 
would carry it on up with him. He might wobble a bit, but he was 
certain that he could hold it. 

He tried one or two more practice swoops, and they got better and 
better. The air on his face, the bounce and woof of his body, all 
combined to make him feel an intoxication of the spirit that he hadn't 
felt since, since - well as far as he could work out, since he was born. 
He drifted away on the breeze and surveyed the countryside, which 
was, he discovered, pretty nasty. It had a wasted ravaged look. He 
decided not to look at it any more. He would just pick up the bag and 
then... he didn't know what he was going to do after he had picked up 
the bag. He decided he would just pick up the bag and see where 
things went from there. 

He judged himself against the wind, pushed up against it and 
turned around. He floated on its body. He didn't realize, but his body 
was willoming at this point. 

He ducked down under the airstream, dipped - and dived. 

The air threw itself past him, he thrilled through it. The ground 
wobbled uncertainly, straightened its ideas out and rose smoothly up 
to meet him, offering the bag, its cracked plastic handles up towards 
him. 

Halfway down there was a sudden dangerous moment when he 
could no longer believe he was doing this, and therefore he very 
nearly wasn't, but he recovered himself in time, skimmed over the 
ground, slipped an arm smoothly through the handles of the bag, and 



began to climb back up, couldn't make it and all of a sudden collapsed, 
bruised, scratched and shaking in the stony ground. 

He staggered instantly to his feet and swayed hopelessly around, 
swinging the bag round him in agony of grief and disappointment. 

His feet, suddenly, were stuck heavily to the ground in the way 
they always had been. His body seemed like an unwieldy sack of 
potatoes that reeled stumbling against the ground, his mind had all 
the lightness of a bag of lead. 

He sagged and swayed and ached with giddiness. He tried 
hopelessly to run, but his legs were suddenly too weak. He tripped 
and flopped forward. At that moment he remembered that in the bag 
he was now carrying was not only a can of Greek olive oil but a duty¬ 
free allowance of retsina, and in the pleasurable shock of that 
realization he failed to notice for at least ten seconds that he was now 
flying again. 

He whooped and cried with relief and pleasure, and sheer physical 
delight. He swooped, he wheeled, he skidded and whirled through the 
air. Cheekily he sat on an updraught and went through the contents 
of the hold-all. He felt the way he imagined an angel must feel during 
its celebrated dance on the head of a pin whilst being counted by 
philosophers. He laughed with pleasure at the discovery that the bag 
did in fact contain the olive oil and the retsina as well as a pair of 
cracked sunglasses, some sand-filled swimming trunks, some creased 
postcards of Santorini, a large and unsightly towel, some interesting 
stones, and various scraps of paper with the addresses of people he 
was relieved to think he would never meet again, even if the reason 
why was a sad one. He dropped the stones, put on the sunglasses, 
and let the pieces of paper whip away in the wind. 

Ten minutes later, drifting idly through a cloud, he got a large and 
extremely disreputable cocktail party in the small of the back. 



Chapter 19 


The longest and most destructive party ever held is now into its 
fourth generation, and still no one shows any signs of leaving. 
Somebody did once look at his watch, but that was eleven years ago, 
and there has been no follow-up. 

The mess is extraordinary, and has to be seen to be believed, but if 
you don't have any particular need to believe it, then don't go and 
look, because you won't enjoy it. 

There have recently been some bangs and flashes up in the clouds, 
and there is one theory that this is a battle being fought between the 
fleets of several rival carpet-cleaning companies who are hovering 
over the thing like vultures, but you shouldn't believe anything you 
hear at parties, and particularly not anything you hear at this one. 

One of the problems, and it's one which is obviously going to get 
worse, is that all the people at the party are either the children or the 
grandchildren or the great-grandchildren of the people who wouldn't 
leave in the first place, and because of all the business about selective 
breeding and regressive genes and so on, it means that all the people 
now at the party are either absolutely fanatical partygoers, or 
gibbering idiots, or, more and more frequently, both. 

Either way, it means that, genetically speaking, each succeeding 
generation is now less likely to leave than the preceding one. 

So other factors come into operation, like when the drink is going 
to run out. 

Now, because of certain things which have happened which 
seemed like a good idea at the time (and one of the problems with a 
party which never stops is that all the things which only seem like a 
good idea at parties continue to seem like good ideas), that point 
seems still to be a long way off. 

One of the things which seemed like a good idea at the time was 
that the party should fly - not in the normal sense that parties are 
meant to fly, but literally. 



One night, long ago, a band of drunken astro-engineers of the first 
generation clambered round the building digging this, fixing that, 
banging very hard on the other and when the sun rose the following 
morning, it was startled to find itself shining on a building full of 
happy drunken people which was now floating like a young and 
uncertain bird over the treetops. 

Not only that, but the flying party had also managed to arm itself 
rather heavily. If they were going to get involved in any petty 
arguments with wine merchants, they wanted to make sure they had 
might on their side. 

The transition from full-time cocktail party to part-time raiding 
party came with ease, and did much to add that extra bit of zest and 
swing to the whole affair which was badly needed at this point 
because of the enormous number of times that the band had already 
played all the numbers it knew over the years. 

They looted, they raided, they held whole cities for ransom for 
fresh supplies of cheese crackers, avocado dip, spare ribs and wine 
and spirits, which would now get piped aboard from floating tankers. 

The problem of when the drink is going to run out is, however, 
going to have to be faced one day. 

The planet over which they are floating is no longer the planet it 
was when they first started floating over it. 

It is in bad shape. 

The party had attacked and raided an awful lot of it, and no one 
has ever succeeded in hitting it back because of the erratic and 
unpredictable way in which it lurches round the sky. 

It is one hell of a party. 

It is also one hell of a thing to get hit by in the small of the back. 



Chapter 20 


Arthur lay floundering in pain on a piece of ripped and 
dismembered reinforced concrete, flicked at by wisps of passing cloud 
and confused by the sounds of flabby merrymaking somewhere 
indistinctly behind him. 

There was a sound he couldn't immediately identify, partly because 
he didn't know the tune "I Left my Leg in Jaglan Beta" and partly 
because the band playing it were very tired, and some members of it 
were playing it in three-four time, some in four-four, and some in a 
kind of pie-eyed r2, each according to the amount of sleep he'd 
managed to grab recently. 

He lay, panting heavily in the wet air, and tried feeling bits of 
himself to see where he might be hurt. Wherever he touched himself, 
he encountered a pain. After a short while he worked out that this 
was because it was his hand that was hurting. He seemed to have 
sprained his wrist. His back, too, was hurting, but he soon satisfied 
himself that he was not badly hurt, but just bruised and a little shaken, 
as who wouldn't be? He couldn't understand what a building would 
be doing flying through the clouds. 

On the other hand, he would have been a little hard-pressed to 
come up with any convincing explanation of his own presence, so he 
decided that he and the building were just going to have to accept 
each other. He looked up from where he was lying. A wall of pale but 
stained stone slabs rose up behind him, the building proper. He 
seemed to be stretched out on some sort of ledge or lip which 
extended outwards for about three or four feet all the way around. It 
was a hunk of the ground in which the party building had had its 
foundations, and which it had taken along with itself to keep itself 
bound together at the bottom end. 

Nervously, he stood up and, suddenly, looking out over the edge, 
he felt nauseous with vertigo. He pressed himself back against the 
wall, wet with mist and sweat. His head was swimming freestyle, but 
someone in his stomach was doing the butterfly. 



Even though he had got up here under his own power, he could 
now not even bear to contemplate the hideous drop in front of him. 
He was not about to try his luck jumping. He was not about to move 
an inch closer to the edge. 

Clutching his hold-all he edged along the wall, hoping to find a 
doorway in. The solid weight of the can of olive oil was a great 
reassurance to him. 

He was edging in the direction of the nearest corner, in the hope 
that the wall around the corner might offer more in the way of 
entrances than this one, which offered none. 

The unsteadiness of the building's flight made him feel sick with 
fear, and after a short while he took the towel from out of his hold-all 
and did something with it which once again justified its supreme 
position in the list of useful things to take with you when you hitch¬ 
hike round the Galaxy. He put it over his head so he wouldn't have to 
see what he was doing. 

His feet edged along the ground. His outstretched hand edged 
along the wall. 

Finally he came to the corner, and as his hand rounded the corner 
it encountered something which gave him such a shock that he nearly 
fell straight off. It was another hand. 

The two hands gripped each other. 

He desperately wanted to use his other hand to pull the towel back 
from his eyes, but it was holding the hold-all with the olive oil, the 
retsina and the postcards from Santorini, and he very much didn't 
want to put it down. 

He experienced one of those "self" moments, one of those 
moments when you suddenly turn around and look at yourself and 
think "Who am I? What am I up to? What have I achieved? Am I doing 
well?" He whimpered very slightly. 

He tried to free his hand, but he couldn't. The other hand was 
holding his tightly. He had no recourse but to edge onwards towards 
the corner. He leaned around it and shook his head in an attempt to 
dislodge the towel. This seemed to provoke a sharp cry of some 
unfashionable emotion from the owner of the other hand. 

The towel was whipped from his head and he found his eyes 
peering into those of Ford Prefect. Beyond him stood Slartibartfast, 



and beyond them he could clearly see a porchway and a large closed 
door. 

They were both pressed back against the wall, eyes wild with terror 
as they stared out into the thick blind cloud around them, and tried to 
resist the lurching and swaying of the building. 

"Where the zarking photon have you been?" hissed Ford, panic 
stricken. 

"Er, well," stuttered Arthur, not really knowing how to sum it all up 
that briefly. "Here and there. What are you doing here?" 

Ford turned his wild eyes on Arthur again. 

"They won't let us in without a bottle," he hissed. 



Chapter 21 


The first thing Arthur noticed as they entered into the thick of the 
party, apart from the noise, the suffocating heat, the wild profusion of 
colours that protuded dimly through the atmosphere of heavy smoke, 
the carpets thick with ground glass, ash and avocado droppings, and 
the small group of pterodactyl-like creatures in lurex who descended 
on his cherished bottle of retsina, squawking, "A new pleasure, a new 
pleasure", was Trillian being chatted up by a Thunder God. 

"Didn't I see you at Milliways?" he was saying. 

"Were you the one with the hammer?" 

"Yes. I much prefer it here. So much less reputable, so much more 
fraught." 

Squeals of some hideous pleasure rang around the room, the outer 
dimensions of which were invisible through the heaving throng of 
happy, noisy creatures, cheerfully yelling things that nobody could 
hear at each other and occasionally having crises. 

"Seems fun," said Trillian. "What did you say, Arthur?" 

"I said, how the hell did you get here?" 

"I was a row of dots flowing randomly through the Universe. Have 
you met Thor? He makes thunder." 

"Hello," said Arthur. "I expect that must be very interesting." 

"Hi," said Thor. "It is. Have you got a drink?" 

"Er, no actually..." 

"Then why don't you go and get one?" 

"See you later, Arthur," said Trillian. 

Something jogged Arthur's mind, and he looked around huntedly. 

"Zaphod isn't here, is he?" he said. 

"See you," said Trillian firmly, "later." 



Thor glared at him with hard coal-black eyes, his beard bristled, 
what little light was there was in the place mustered its forces briefly 
to glint menacingly off the horns of his helmet. 

He took Trillian's elbow in his extremely large hand and the 
muscles in his upper arm moved around each other like a couple of 
Volkswagens parking. 

He led her away. 

"One of the interesting things about being immortal," he said, 
"is..." 

"One of the interesting things about space," Arthur heard 
Slartibartfast saying to a large and voluminous creature who looked 
like someone losing a fight with a pink duvet and was gazing raptly at 
the old man's deep eyes and silver beard, "is how dull it is." 

"Dull?" said the creature, and blinked her rather wrinkled and 
bloodshot eyes. 

"Yes," said Slartibartfast, "staggeringly dull. Bewilderingly so. You 
see, there's so much of it and so little in it. Would you like me to 
quote some statistics?" 

"Er, well..." 

"Please, I would like to. They, too, are quite sensationally dull." 

"I'll come back and hear them in a moment," she said, patting him 
on the arm, lifted up her skirts like a hovercraft and moved off into 
the heaving crown. 

"I thought she'd never go," growled the old man. "Come, 
Earthman..." 

"Arthur." 

"We must find the Silver Bail, it is here somewhere." 

"Can't we just relax a little?" Arthur said. "I've had a tough day. 
Trillian's here, incidentally, she didn't say how, it probably doesn't 
matter." 

"Think of the danger to the Universe..." 

"The Universe," said Arthur, "is big enough and old enough to look 
after itself for half an hour. All right," he added, in response to 
Slartibartfast's increasing agitation, "I'll wander round and see if 
anybody's seen it." 



"Good, good," said Slartibartfast, "good. " He plunged into the 
crowd himself, and was told to relax by everybody he passed. 

"Have you seen a bail anywhere?" said Arthur to a little man who 
seemed to be standing eagerly waiting to listen to somebody. "It's 
made of silver, vitally important for the future safety of the Universe, 
and about this long." 

"No," said the enthusiastically wizened little man, "but do have a 
drink and tell me all about it." 

Ford Prefect writhed past, dancing a wild, frenetic and not entirely 
unobscene dance with someone who looked as if she was wearing 
Sydney Opera House on her head. He was yelling a futile conversation 
at her above the din. 

"I like that hat!" he bawled. 

"What?" 

"I said, I like the hat." 

"I'm not wearing a hat." 

"Well, I like the head, then." 

"What?" 

"I said, I like the head. Interesting bone-structure." 

"What?" 

Ford worked a shrug into the complex routine of other movements 
he was performing. 

"I said, you dance great," he shouted, "just don't nod so much." 

"What?" 

"It's just that every time you nod," said Ford,"... owl" he added as 
his partner nodded forward to say "What?" and once again pecked 
him sharply on the forehead with the sharp end of her swept-forward 
skull. 

"My planet was blown up one morning," said Arthur, who had 
found himself quite unexpectedly telling the little man his life story or, 
at least, edited highlights of it, "that's why I'm dressed like this, in my 
dressing gown. My planet was blown up with all my clothes in it, you 
see. I didn't realize I'd be coming to a party." 

The little man nodded enthusiastically. 

"Later, I was thrown off a spaceship. Still in my dressing gown. 
Rather than the space suit one would normally expect. Shortly after 



that I discovered that my planet had originally been built for a bunch 
of mice. You can imagine how I felt about that. I was then shot at for a 
while and blown up. In fact I have been blown up ridiculously often, 
shot at, insulted, regularly disintegrated, deprived of tea, and recently 
I crashed into a swamp and had to spend five years in a damp cave." 

"Ah," effervesced the little man, "and did you have a wonderful 
time?" 

Arthur started to choke violently on his drink. 

"What a wonderful exciting cough," said the little man, quite 
startled by it, "do you mind if I join you?" 

And with that he launched into the most extraordinary and 
spectacular fit of coughing which caught Arthur so much by surprise 
that he started to choke violently, discovered he was already doing it 
and got thoroughly confused. 

Together they performed a lung-busting duet which went on for 
fully two minutes before Arthur managed to cough and splutter to a 
halt. 

"So invigorating," said the little man, panting and wiping tears from 
his eyes. "What an exciting life you must lead. Thank you very much." 

He shook Arthur warmly by the hand and walked off into the crowd. 
Arthur shook his head in astonishment. 

A youngish-looking man came up to him, an aggressive-looking 
type with a hook mouth, a lantern nose, and small beady little 
cheekbones. He was wearing black trousers, a black silk shirt open to 
what was presumably his navel, though Arthur had learnt never to 
make assumptions about the anatomies of the sort of people he 
tended to meet these days, and had all sorts of nasty dangly gold 
things hanging round his neck. He carried something in a black bag, 
and clearly wanted people to notice that he didn't want them to 
notice it. 

"Hey, er, did I hear you say your name just now?" he said. 

This was one of the many things that Arthur had told the 
enthusiastic little man. 

"Yes, it's Arthur Dent." 

The man seemed to be dancing slightly to some rhythm other than 
any of the several that the band were grimly pushing out. 



"Yeah," he said, "only there was a man in a mountain wanted to 
see you." 

"I met him." 

"Yeah, only he seemed pretty anxious about it, you know." 

"Yes, I met him." 

"Yeah, well I think you should know that." 

"I do. I met him." 

The man paused to chew a little gum. Then he clapped Arthur on 
the back. 

"OK," he said, "all right. I'm just telling you, right? Good night, good 
luck, win awards." 

"What?" said Arthur, who was beginning to flounder seriously at 
this point. 

"Whatever. Do what you do. Do it well." He made a sort of clucking 
noise with whatever he was chewing and then some vaguely dynamic 
gesture. 

"Why?" said Arthur. 

"Do it badly," said the man, "who cares? Who gives a shit?" The 
blood suddenly seemed to pump angrily into the man's face and he 
started to shout. 

"Why not go mad?" he said. "Go away, get off my back will you, 
guy. Just zark off!!!" 

"OK, I'm going," said Arthur hurriedly. 

"It's been real." The man gave a sharp wave and disappeared off 
into the throng. 

"What was that about?" said Arthur to a girl he found standing 
beside him. "Why did he tell me to win awards?" 

"Just showbiz talk," shrugged the girl. "He's just won an award at 
the Annual Ursa Minor Alpha Recreational Illusions Institute Awards 
Ceremony, and was hoping to be able to pass it off lightly, only you 
didn't mention it, so he couldn't." 

"Oh," said Arthur, "oh, well I'm sorry I didn't. What was it for?" 

"The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word 'Fuck' In A Serious 
Screenplay. It's very prestigious." 

"I see," said Arthur, "yes, and what do you get for that?" 



"A Rory. It's just a small silver thing set on a large black base. What 
did you say?" 

"I didn't say anything. I was just about to ask what the silver..." 
"Oh, I thought you said 'wop'." 

"Said what?" 

"Wop." 



Chapter 22 


People had been dropping in on the party now for some years, 
fashionable gatecrashers from other worlds, and for some time it had 
occurred to the partygoers as they had looked out at their own world 
beneath them, with its wrecked cities, its ravaged avocado farms and 
blighted vineyards, its vast tracts of new desert, its seas full of biscuit 
crumbs and worse, that their world was in some tiny and almost 
imperceptible ways not quite as much fun as it had been. Some of 
them had begun to wonder if they could manage to stay sober for 
long enough to make the entire party spaceworthy and maybe take it 
off to some other people's worlds where the air might be fresher and 
give them fewer headaches. 

The few undernourished farmers who still managed to scratch out 
a feeble existence on the half-dead ground of the planet's surface 
would have been extremely pleased to hear this, but that day, as the 
party came screaming out of the clouds and the farmers looked up in 
haggard fear of yet another cheese-and-wine raid, it became clear 
that the party was not going to be going anywhere else for a while, 
that the party would soon be over. Very soon it would be time to 
gather up hats and coats and stagger blearily outside to find out what 
time of day it was, what time of year it was, and whether in any of 
this burnt and ravaged land there was a taxi going anywhere. 

The party was locked in a horrible embrace with a strange white 
spaceship which seemed to be half sticking through it. Together they 
were lurching, heaving and spinning their way round the sky in 
grotesque disregard of their own weight. 

The clouds parted. The air roared and leapt out of their way. 

The party and the Krikkit warship looked, in their writhings, a little 
like two ducks, one of which is trying to make a third duck inside the 
second duck, whilst the second duck is trying very hard to explain that 
it doesn't feel ready for a third duck right now, is uncertain that it 
would want any putative third duck to be made by this particular first 



duck anyway, and certainly not whilst it, the second duck, was busy 
flying. 

The sky sang and screamed with the rage of it all and buffeted the 
ground with shock waves. 

And suddenly, with a foop, the Krikkit ship was gone. 

The party blundered helplessly across the sky like a man leaning 
against an unexpectedly open door. It span and wobbled on its hover 
jets. It tried to right itself and wronged itself instead. It staggered back 
across the sky again. 

For a while these staggerings continued, but clearly they could not 
continue for long. The party was now a mortally wounded party. All 
the fun had gone out of it, as the occasional broken-backed pirouette 
could not disguise. 

The longer, at this point, that it avoided the ground, the heavier 
was going to be the crash when finally it hit it. 

Inside, things were not going well either. They were going 
monstrously badly, in fact, and people were hating it and saying so 
loudly. The Krikkit robots had been. 

They had removed the Award for The Most Gratuitous Use Of The 
Word 'Fuck' In A Serious Screenplay, and in its place had left a scene 
of devastation that left Arthur feeling almost as sick as a runner-up 
for a Rory. 

"We would love to stay and help," shouted Ford, picking his way 
over the mangled debris, "only we're not going to." 

The party lurched again, provoking feverish cries and groans from 
amongst the smoking wreckage. 

"We have to go and save the Universe, you see," said Ford. "And if 
that sounds like a pretty lame excuse, then you may be right. Either 
way, we're off." 

Fie suddenly came across an unopened bottle lying, miraculously 
unbroken, on the ground. 

"Do you mind if we take this?" he said. "You won't be needing it." 

Fie took a packet of potato crisps too. 

"Trillian?" shouted Arthur in a shocked and weakened voice. In the 
smoking mess he could see nothing. 



"Earthman, we must go," said Slartibartfast nervously. 

"Trillian?" shouted Arthur again. 

A moment or two later, Trillian staggered, shaking, into view, 
supported by her new friend the Thunder God. 

"The girl stays with me," said Thor. "There's a great party going on 
in Valhalla, we'll be flying off..." 

"Where were you when all this was going on?" said Arthur. 

"Upstairs," said Thor, "I was weighing her. Flying's a tricky business 
you see, you have to calculate wind..." 

"She comes with us," said Arthur. 

"Hey," said Trillian, "don't I..." 

"No," said Arthur, "you come with us." 

Thor looked at him with slowly smouldering eyes. He was making 
some point about godliness and it had nothing to do with being clean. 

"She comes with me," he said quietly. 

"Come on, Earthman," said Slartibartfast nervously, picking at 
Arthur's sleeve. 

"Come on, Slartibartfast," said Ford, picking at the old man's sleeve. 
Slartibartfast had the teleport device. 

The party lurched and swayed, sending everyone reeling, except 
for Thor and except for Arthur, who stared, shaking, into the Thunder 
God's black eyes. 

Slowly, incredibly, Arthur put up what appeared to be his tiny little 
fists. 

"Want to make something of it?" he said. 

"I beg your minuscule pardon?" roared Thor. 

"I said," repeated Arthur, and he could not keep the quavering out 
of his voice, "do you want to make something of it?" He waggled his 
fists ridiculously. 

Thor looked at him with incredulity. Then a little wisp of smoke 
curled upwards from his nostril. There was a tiny little flame in it too. 

He gripped his belt. 

He expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was the 
sort of man you only dared to cross if you had a team of Sherpas with 
you. 



He unhooked the shaft of his hammer from his belt. He held it up in 
his hands to reveal the massive iron head. He thus cleared up any 
possible misunderstanding that he might merely have been carrying a 
telegraph pole around with him. 

"Do I want," he said, with a hiss like a river flowing through a steel 
mill, "to make something of it?" 

"Yes," said Arthur, his voice suddenly and extraordinarily strong 
and belligerent. He waggled his fists again, this time as if he meant it. 

"You want to step outside?" he snarled at Thor. 

"All right!" bellowed Thor, like an enraged bull (or in fact like an 
enraged Thunder God, which is a great deal more impressive), and did 
so. 

"Good," said Arthur, "that's got rid of him. Slarty, get us out of 
here." 



Chapter 23 


"All right," shouted Ford at Arthur, "so I'm a coward, the point is 
I'm still alive." They were back aboard the Starship Bistromath, so was 
Slartibartfast, so was Trillian. Harmony and concord were not. 

"Well, so am I alive, aren't I?" retaliated Arthur, haggard with 
adventure and anger. His eyebrows were leaping up and down as if 
they wanted to punch each other. 

"You damn nearly weren't," exploded Ford. 

Arthur turned sharply to Slartibartfast, who was sitting in his pilot 
couch on the flight deck gazing thoughtfully into the bottom of a 
bottle which was telling him something he clearly couldn't fathom. He 
appealed to him. 

"Do you think he understands the first word I've been saying?" he 
said, quivering with emotion. 

"I don't know," replied Slartibartfast, a little abstractedly. "I'm not 
sure," he added, glancing up very briefly, "that I do." He stared at his 
instruments with renewed vigor and bafflement. "You'll have to 
explain it to us again," he said. 

"Well..." 

"But later. Terrible things are afoot." 

He tapped the pseudo-glass of the bottle bottom. 

"We fared rather pathetically at the party. I'm afraid," he said, "and 
our only hope now is to try to prevent the robots from using the Key 
in the Lock. How in heaven we do that I don't know," he muttered. 
"Just have to go there, I suppose. Can't say I like the idea at all. 
Probably end up dead." 

"Where is Trillian anyway?" said Arthur with a sudden affectation 
of unconcern. What he had been angry about was that Ford had 
berated him for wasting time over all the business with the Thunder 
God when they could have been making a rather more rapid escape. 
Arthur's own opinion, and he had offered it for whatever anybody 



might have felt it was worth, was that he had been extraordinarily 
brave and resourceful. 

The prevailing view seemed to be that his opinion was not worth a 
pair of fetid dingo's kidneys. What really hurt, though, was that 
Trillian didn't seem to react much one way or the other and had 
wandered off somewhere. 

"And where are my potato crisps?" said Ford. 

"They are both," said Slartibartfast, without looking up, "in the 
Room of Informational Illusions. I think that your young lady friend is 
trying to understand some problems of Galactic history. I think the 
potato crisps are probably helping her." 



Chapter 24 


It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with 
potatoes. 

For instance, there was once an insanely aggressive race of people 
called the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax. That was just the name of 
their race. The name of their army was something quite horrific. 

Luckily they lived even further back in Galactic history than anything 
we have so far encountered - twenty billion years ago - when the 
Galaxy was young and fresh, and every idea worth fighting for was a 
new one. 

And fighting was what the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax were 
good at, and being good at it, they did a lot. They fought their 
enemies (i.e. everybody else), they fought each other. Their planet 
was a complete wreck. The surface was littered with abandoned cities 
which were surrounded by abandoned war machines, which were in 
turn surrounded by deep bunkers in which the Silastic Armorfiends 
lived and squabbled with each other. 

The best way to pick a fight with a Silastic Armorfiend was just to 
be born. They didn't like it, they got resentful. And when an 
Armorfiend got resentful, someone got hurt. An exhausting way of life, 
one might think, but they did seem to have an awful lot of energy. 

The best way of dealing with a Silastic Armorfiend was to put him 
into a room of his own, because sooner or later he would simply beat 
himself up. 

Eventually they realized that this was something they were going 
to have to sort out, and they passed a law decreeing that anyone who 
had to carry a weapon as part of his normal Silastic work (policemen, 
security guards, primary school teachers, etc.) had to spend at least 
forty-five minutes every day punching a sack of potatoes in order to 
work off his or her surplus aggressions. 



For a while this worked well, until someone thought that it would 
be much more efficient and less time-consuming if they just shot the 
potatoes instead. 

This led to a renewed enthusiasm for shooting all sorts of things, 
and they all got very excited at the prospect of their first major war 
for weeks. 

Another achievement of the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax is that 
they were the first race who ever managed to shock a computer. 

It was a gigantic spaceborne computer called Hactar, which to this 
day is remembered as one of the most powerful ever built. It was the 
first to be built like a natural brain, in that every cellular particle of it 
carried the pattern of the whole within it, which enabled it to think 
more flexibly and imaginatively, and also, it seemed, to be shocked. 

The Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax were engaged in one of their 
regular wars with the Strenuous Garfighters of Stug, and were not 
enjoying it as much as usual because it involved an awful lot of 
trekking through the Radiation Swamps of Cwulzenda, and across the 
Fire Mountains of Frazfraga, neither of which terrains they felt at 
home in. 

So when the Strangulous Stilettans of Jajazikstak joined in the fray 
and forced them to fight another front in the Gamma Caves of Carfrax 
and the Ice Storms of Varlengooten, they decided that enough was 
enough, and they ordered Flactar to design for them an Ultimate 
Weapon. 

"What do you mean," asked Flactar, "by Ultimate?" 

To which the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax said, "Read a bloody 
dictionary," and plunged back into the fray. 

So Flactar designed an Ultimate Weapon. 

It was a very, very small bomb which was simply a junction box in 
hyperspace that would, when activated, connect the heart of every 
major sun with the heart of every other major sun simultaneously and 
thus turn the entire Universe in to one gigantic hyperspatial 
supernova. 

When the Silastic Armorfiends tried to use it to blow up a 
Strangulous Stilettan munitions dump in one of the Gamma Caves, 
they were extremely irritated that it didn't work, and said so. 

Flactar had been shocked by the whole idea. 



He tried to explain that he had been thinking about this Ultimate 
Weapon business, and had worked out that there was no conceivable 
consequence of not setting the bomb off that was worse than the 
known consequence of setting it off, and he had therefore taken the 
liberty of introducing a small flaw into the design of the bomb, and he 
hoped that everyone involved would, on sober reflection, feel that... 

The Silastic Armorfiends disagreed and pulverized the computer. 

Later they thought better of it, and destroyed the faulty bomb as 
well. 

Then, pausing only to smash the hell out of the Strenuous 
Garfighters of Stug, and the Strangulous Stilettans of Jajazikstak, they 
went on to find an entirely new way of blowing themselves up, which 
was a profound relief to everyone else in the Galaxy, particularly the 
Garfighters, the Stilettans and the potatoes. 

Trillian had watched all this, as well as the story of Krikkit. She 
emerged from the Room of informational Illusions thoughtfully, just 
in time to discover that they had arrived too late. 



Chapter 25 


Even as the Starship Bistromath flickered into objective being on 
the top of a small cliff on the mile-wide asteroid which pursued a 
lonely and eternal path in orbit around the enclosed star system of 
Krikkit, its crew was aware that they were in time only to be witnesses 
to an unstoppable historic event. 

They didn't realize they were going to see two. 

They stood cold, lonely and helpless on the cliff edge and watched 
the activity below. Lances of light wheeled in sinister arcs against the 
void from a point only about a hundred yards below and in front of 
them. 

They stared into the blinding event. 

An extension of the ship's field enabled them to stand there, by 
once again exploiting the mind's predisposition to have tricks played 
on it: the problems of falling up off the tiny mass of the asteroid, or of 
not being able to breathe, simply became Somebody Else's. 

The white Krikkit warship was parked amongst the stark grey crags 
of the asteroid, alternately flaring under arclights or disappearing in 
shadow. The blackness of the shaped shadows cast by the hard rocks 
danced together in wild choreography as the arclights swept round 
them. 

The eleven white robots were bearing, in procession, the Wikkit 
Key out into the middle of a circle of swinging lights. 

The Wikkit Key was rebuilt. Its components shone and glittered: 
the Steel Pillar (or Marvin's leg) of Strength and Power, the Gold Bail 
(or Heart of the Improbability Drive) of Prosperity, the Perspex Pillar 
(or Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice) of Science and Reason, the Silver 
Bail (or Rory Award for The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word "Fuck" 

In A Serious Screenplay) and the now reconstituted Wooden Pillar (or 
Ashes of a burnt stump signifying the death of English cricket) of 
Nature and Spirituality. 



"I suppose there is nothing we can do at this point?" asked Arthur 
nervously. 

"No," sighed Slartibartfast. 

The expression of disappointment which crossed Arthur's face was 
a complete failure, and, since he was standing obscured by shadow, 
he allowed it to collapse into one of relief. 

"Pity," he said. 

"We have no weapons," said Slartibartfast, "stupidly." 

"Damn," said Arthur very quietly. 

Ford said nothing. 

Trillian said nothing, but in a peculiarly thoughtful and distinct way. 
She was staring at the blankness of the space beyond the asteroid. 

The asteroid circled the Dust Cloud which surrounded the Slo-Time 
envelope which enclosed the world on which lived the people of 
Krikkit, the Masters of Krikkit and their killer robots. 

The helpless group had no way of knowing whether or not the 
Krikkit robots were aware of their presence. They could only assume 
that they must be, but that they felt, quite rightly in the 
circumstances, that they had nothing to fear. They had an historic 
task to perform, and their audience could be regarded with contempt. 

"Terrible impotent feeling, isn't it?" said Arthur, but the others 
ignored him. 

In the centre of the area of light which the robots were 
approaching, a square-shaped crack appeared in the ground. The 
crack defined itself more and more distinctly, and soon it became 
clear that a block of the ground, about six feet square, was slowly 
rising. 

At the same time they became aware of some other movement, 
but it was almost sublimal, and for a moment or two it was not clear 
what it was that was moving. 

Then it became clear. 

The asteroid was moving. It was moving slowly in towards the Dust 
Cloud, as if being hauled in inexorably by some celestial angler in its 
depths. 



They were to make in real life the journey through the Cloud which 
they had already made in the Room of Informational Illusions. They 
stood frozen in silence. Trillian frowned. 

An age seemed to pass. Events seemed to pass with spinning 
slowness, as the leading edge of the asteroid passed into the vague 
and soft outer perimeter of the Cloud. 

And soon they were engulfed in a thin and dancing obscurity. They 
passed on through it, on and on, dimly aware of vague shapes and 
whorls indistinguishable in the darkness except in the corner of the 
eye. 

The Dust dimmed the shafts of brilliant light. The shafts of brilliant 
light twinkled on the myriad specks of Dust. 

Trillian, again, regarded the passage from within her own frowning 
thoughts. 

And they were through it. Whether it had taken a minute or half an 
hour they weren't sure, but they were through it and confronted with 
a fresh blankness, as if space were pinched out of existence in front of 
them. 

And now things moved quickly. 

A blinding shaft of light seemed almost to explode from out of the 
block which had risen three feet out of the ground, and out of that 
rose a smaller Perspex block, dazzling with interior dancing colours. 

The block was slotted with deep groves, three upright and two 
across, clearly designed to accept the Wikkit key. 

The robots approached the Lock, slotted the Key into its home and 
stepped back again. The block twisted round of is own accord, and 
space began to alter. 

As space unpinched itself, it seemed agonizingly to twist the eyes 
of the watchers in their sockets. They found themselves staring, 
blinded, at an unravelled sun which stood now before them where it 
seemed only seconds before there had not been even empty space. It 
was a second or two before they were even sufficiently aware of what 
had happened to throw their hands up over their horrified blinded 
eyes. In that second or two, they were aware of a tiny speck moving 
slowly across the eye of that sun. 

They staggered back, and heard ringing in their ears the thin and 
unexpected chant of the robots crying out in unison. 



"Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit!" 

The sound chilled them. It was harsh, it was cold, it was empty, it 
was mechanically dismal. 

It was also triumphant. 

They were so stunned by these two sensory shocks that they 
almost missed the second historic event. 

Zaphod Beeblebrox, the only man in history to survive a direct blast 
attack from the Krikkit robots, ran out of the Krikkit warship 
brandishing a Zap gun. 

"OK," he cried, "the situation is totally under control as of this 
moment in time." 

The single robot guarding the hatchway to the ship silently swung 
his battleclub, and connected it with the back of Zaphod's left head. 

"Who the zark did that?" said the left head, and lolled sickeningly 
forward. 

His right head gazed keenly into the middle distance. 

"Who did what?" it said. 

The club connected with the back of his right head. 

Zaphod measured his length as a rather strange shape on the 
ground. 

Within a matter of seconds the whole event was over. A few blasts 
from the robots were sufficient to destroy the Lock for ever. It split 
and melted and splayed its contents brokenly. The robots marched 
grimly and, it almost seemed, in a slightly disheartened manner, back 
into their warship which, with a "foop", was gone. 

Trillian and Ford ran hectically round and down the steep incline to 
the dark, still body of Zaphod Beeblebrox. 



Chapter 26 


"I don't know," said Zaphod, for what seemed to him like the thirty- 
seventh time, "they could have killed me, but they didn't. Maybe they 
just thought I was a kind of wonderful guy or something. I could 
understand that." 

The others silently registered their opinions of this theory. 

Zaphod lay on the cold floor of the flight deck. His back seemed to 
wrestle the floor as pain thudded through him and banged at his 
heads. 

"I think," he whispered, "that there is something wrong with those 
anodized dudes, something fundamentally weird." 

"They are programmed to kill everybody," Slartibartfast pointed 
out. 

"That," wheezed Zaphod between the whacking thuds, "could be 
it." He didn't seem altogether convinced. 

"Hey, baby," he said to Trillian, hoping this would make up for his 
previous behaviour. 

"You all right?" she said gently. 

"Yeah," he said, "I'm fine." 

"Good," she said, and walked away to think. She stared at the huge 
visiscreen over the flight couches and, twisting a switch, she flipped 
local images over it. One image was the blankness of the Dust Cloud. 
One was the sun of Krikkit. One was Krikkit itself. She flipped between 
them fiercely. 

"Well, that's goodbye Galaxy, then," said Arthur, slapping his knees 
and standing up. 

"No," said Slartibartfast, gravely. "Our course is clear." He furrowed 
his brow until you could grow some of the smaller root vegetables in 
it. He stood up, he paced around. When he spoke again, what he said 
frightened him so much he had to sit down again. 



"We must go down to Krikkit," he said. A deep sigh shook his old 
frame and his eyes seemed almost to rattle in their sockets. 

"Once again," he said, "we have failed pathetically. Quite 
pathetically." 

"That," said Ford quietly, "is because we don't care enough. I told 
you." 

He swung his feet up on the instrument panel and picked fitfully at 
something on one of his fingernails. 

"But unless we determine to take action," said the old man 
querulously, as if struggling against something deeply insouciant in his 
nature, "then we shall all be destroyed, we shall all die. Surely we care 
about that?" 

"Not enough to want to get killed over it," said Ford. He put on a 
sort of hollow smile and flipped it round the room at anyone who 
wanted to see it. 

Slartibartfast clearly found this point of view extremely seductive 
and he fought against it. He turned again to Zaphod who was gritting 
his teeth and sweating with the pain. 

"You surely must have some idea," he said, "of why they spared 
your life. It seems most strange and unusual." 

"I kind of think they didn't even know," shrugged Zaphod. "I told 
you. They hit me with the most feeble blast, just knocked me out, 
right? They lugged me into their ship, dumped me into a corner and 
ignored me. Like they were embarrassed about me being there. If I 
said anything they knocked me out again. We had some great 
conversations. 'Hey... ugh!' 'Hi there... ugh!' 'I wonder...ugh!' Kept me 
amused for hours, you know." He winced again. 

He was toying with something in his fingers. He held it up. It was 
the Gold Bail - the Heart of Gold, the heart of the Infinite 
Improbability Drive. Only that and the Wooden Pillar had survived the 
destruction of the Lock intact. 

"I hear your ship can move a bit," he said. "So how would you like 
to zip me back to mine before you..." 

"Will you not help us?" said Slartibartfast. 

"I'd love to stay and help you save the Galaxy," insisted Zaphod, 
rising himself up on to his shoulders, "but I have the mother and 
father of a pair of headaches, and I feel a lot of little headaches 



coming on. But next time it needs saving, I'm your guy. Hey, Trillian 
baby?" 

She looked round briefly. 

"Yes?" 

"You want to come? Heart of Gold? Excitement and adventure and 
really wild things?" 

"I'm going down to Krikkit," she said. 



Chapter 27 


It was the same hill, and yet not the same. 

This time it was not an Informational Illusion. This was Krikkit itself 
and they were standing on it. Near them, behind the trees, stood the 
strange Italian restaurant which had brought these, their real bodies, 
to this, the real, present world of Krikkit. 

The strong grass under their feet was real, the rich soil real too. The 
heady fragrances from the tree, too, were real. The night was real 
night. 

Krikkit. 

Possibly the most dangerous place in the Galaxy for anyone who 
isn't a Krikkiter to stand. The place that could not countenance the 
existence of any other place, whose charming, delightful, intelligent 
inhabitants would howl with fear, savagery and murderous hate when 
confronted with anyone not their own. 

Arthur shuddered. 

Slartibartfast shuddered. 

Ford, surprisingly, shuddered. 

It was not surprising that he shuddered, it was surprising that he 
was there at all. But when they had returned Zaphod to his ship Ford 
had felt unexpectedly shamed into not running away. 

Wrong, he thought to himself, wrong wrong wrong. Fie hugged to 
himself one of the Zap guns with which they had armed themselves 
out of Zaphod's armoury. 

Trillian shuddered, and frowned as she looked into the sky. 

This, too, was not the same. It was no longer blank and empty. 

Whilst the countryside around them had changed little in the two 
thousand years of the Krikkit wars, and the mere five years that had 
elapsed locally since Krikkit was sealed in its Slo-Time envelope ten 
billion years ago, the sky was dramatically different. 

Dim lights and heavy shapes hung in it. 



High in the sky, where no Krikkiter ever looked, were the War 
Zones, the Robot Zones - huge warships and tower blocks floating in 
the Nil-O-Grav fields far above the idyllic pastoral lands of the surface 
of Krikkit. 

Trillian stared at them and thought. 

"Trillian," whispered Ford Prefect to her. 

"Yes?" she said. 

"What are you doing?" 

"Thinking." 

"Do you always breathe like that when you're thinking?" 

"I wasn't aware that I was breathing." 

"That's what worried me." 

"I think I know..." said Trillian. 

"Shhhh!" said Slartibartfast in alarm, and his thin trembling hand 
motioned them further back beneath the shadow of the tree. 

Suddenly, as before in the tape, there were lights coming along the 
hill path, but this time the dancing beams were not from lanterns but 
electric torches - not in itself a dramatic change, but every detail 
made their hearts thump with fear. This time there were no lilting 
whimsical songs about flowers and farming and dead dogs, but 
hushed voices in urgent debate. 

A light moved in the sky with slow weight. Arthur was clenched 
with a claustrophobic terror and the warm wind caught at his throat. 

Within seconds a second party became visible, approaching from 
the other side of the dark hill. They were moving swiftly and 
purposefully, their torches swinging and probing around them. 

The parties were clearly converging, and not merely with each 
other. They were converging deliberately on the spot where Arthur 
and the others were standing. 

Arthur heard the slight rustle as Ford Prefect raised his Zap gun to 
his shoulder, and the slight whimpering cough as Slartibartfast raised 
his. He felt the cold unfamiliar weight of his own gun, and with 
shaking hands he raised it. 

His fingers fumbled to release the safety catch and engage the 
extreme danger catch as Ford had shown him. He was shaking so 



much that if he'd fired at anybody at that moment he probably would 
have burnt his signature on them. 

Only Trillian didn't raise her gun. She raised her eyebrows, lowered 
them again, and bit her lip in thought. 

"Has it occurred to you," she began, but nobody wanted to discuss 
anything much at the moment. 

A light stabbed through the darkness from behind them and they 
span around to find a third party of Krikkiters behind them, searching 
them out with their torches. 

Ford Prefect's gun crackled viciously, but fire spat back at it and it 
crashed from his hands. 

There was a moment of pure fear, a frozen second before anyone 
fired again. 

And at the end of the second nobody fired. 

They were surrounded by pale-faced Krikkiters and bathed in 
bobbing torch light. 

The captives stared at their captors, the captors stared at their 
captives. 

"Hello?" said one of the captors. "Excuse me, but are you... aliens?" 



Chapter 28 


Meanwhile, more millions of miles away than the mind can 
comfortably encompass, Zaphod Beeblebrox was throwing a mood 
again. 

He had repaired his ship - that is, he'd watched with alert interest 
whilst a service robot had repaired it for him. It was now, once again, 
one of the most powerful and extraordinary ships in existence. He 
could go anywhere, do anything. He fiddled with a book, and then 
tossed it away. It was the one he'd read before. 

He walked over to the communications bank and opened an all¬ 
frequencies emergency channel. 

"Anyone want a drink?" he said. 

"This an emergency, feller?" crackled a voice from halfway across 
the Galaxy. 

"Got any mixers?" said Zaphod. 

"Go take a ride on a comet." 

"OK, OK," said Zaphod and flipped the channel shut again. He 
sighed and sat down. He got up again and wandered over to a 
computer screen. He pushed a few buttons. Little blobs started to 
rush around the screen eating each other. 

"Pow!" said Zaphod. "Freeeoooo! Pop pop pop!" 

"Hi there," said the computer brightly after a minute of this, "you 
have scored three points. Previous best score, seven million five 
hundred and ninety-seven thousand, two hundred and..." 

"OK, OK," said Zaphod and flipped the screen blank again. 

He sat down again. He played with a pencil. This too began slowly 
to lose its fascination. 

"OK, OK," he said, and fed his score and the previous one into the 
computer. 

His ship made a blur of the Universe. 



Chapter 29 


"Tell us," said the thin, pale-faced Krikkiter who had stepped 
forward from the ranks of the others and stood uncertainly in the 
circle of torchlight, handling his gun as if he was just holding it for 
someone else who'd just popped off somewhere but would be back in 
a minute, "do you know anything about something called the Balance 
of Nature?" 

There was no reply from their captives, or at least nothing more 
articulate than a few confused mumbles and grunts. The torchlight 
continued to play over them. High in the sky above them dark activity 
continued in the Robot zones. 

"It's just," continued the Krikkiter uneasily, "something we heard 
about, probably nothing important. Well, I suppose we'd better kill 
you then." 

He looked down at his gun as if he was trying to find which bit to 
press. 

"That is," he said, looking up again, "unless there's anything you 
want to chat about?" 

Slow, numb astonishment crept up the bodies of Slartibartfast, 

Ford and Arthur. Very soon it would reach their brains, which were at 
the moment solely occupied with moving their jawbones up and 
down. Trillian was shaking her head as if trying to finish a jigsaw by 
shaking the box. 

"We're worried, you see," said another man from the crowd, 

"about this plan of universal destruction." 

"Yes," added another, "and the balance of nature. It just seemed to 
us that if the whole of the rest of the Universe is destroyed it will 
somehow upset the balance of nature. We're quite keen on ecology, 
you see." His voice trailed away unhappily. 

"And sport," said another, loudly. This got a cheer of approval from 
the others. 



"Yes," agreed the first, "and sport..." He looked back at his fellows 
uneasily and scratched fitfully at his cheek. He seemed to be wrestling 
with some deep inner confusion, as if everything he wanted to say 
and everything he thought were entirely different things, between 
which he could see no possible connection. 

"You see," he mumbled, "some of us..." and he looked around 
again as if for confirmation. The others made encouraging noises. 
"Some of us," he continued, "are quite keen to have sporting links 
with the rest of the Galaxy, and though I can see the argument about 
keeping sport out of politics, I think that if we want to have sporting 
links with the rest of the Galaxy, which we do, then it's probably a 
mistake to destroy it. And indeed the rest of the Universe..." his voice 
trailed away again "... which is what seems to be the idea now..." 

"Wh..." said Slartibartfast. "Wh..." 

"Hhhh... ?" said Arthur. 

"Dr..." said Ford Prefect. 

"OK," said Trillian. "Let's talk about it." She walked forward and 
took the poor confused Krikkiter by the arm. He looked about twenty- 
five, which meant, because of the peculiar manglings of time that had 
been going on in this area, that he would have been just twenty when 
the Krikkit Wars were finished, ten billion years ago. 

Trillian led him for a short walk through the torchlight before she 
said anything more. He stumbled uncertainly after her. The encircling 
torch beams were drooping now slightly as if they were abdicating to 
this strange, quiet girl who alone in the Universe of dark confusion 
seemed to know what she was doing. 

She turned and faced him, and lightly held both his arms. He was a 
picture of bewildered misery. 

"Tell me," she said. 

He said nothing for a moment, whilst his gaze darted from one of 
her eyes to the other. 

"We..." he said, "we have to be alone... I think." He screwed up his 
face and then dropped his head forward, shaking it like someone 
trying to shake a coin out of a money box. He looked up again. "We 
have this bomb now, you see," he said, "it's just a little one." 


"I know," she said. 



He goggled at her as if she'd said something very strange about 
beetroots. 

"Honestly," he said, "it's very, very little." 

"I know," she said again. 

"But they say," his voice trailed on, "they say it can destroy 
everything that exists. And we have to do that, you see, I think. Will 
that make us alone? I don't know. It seems to be our function, 
though," he said, and dropped his head again. 

"Whatever that means," said a hollow voice from the crowd. 

Trillian slowly put her arms around the poor bewildered young 
Krikkiter and patted his trembling head on her shoulder. 

"It's all right," she said quietly but clearly enough for all the 
shadowy crowd to hear, "you don't have to do it." 

She rocked him. 

"You don't have to do it," she said again. 

She let him go and stood back. 

"I want you to do something for me," she said, and unexpectedly 
laughed. 

"I want," she said, and laughed again. She put her hand over her 
mouth and then said with a straight face, "I want you to take me to 
your leader," and she pointed into the War Zones in the sky. She 
seemed somehow to know that their leader would be there. 

Her laughter seemed to discharge something in the atmosphere. 
From somewhere at the back of the crowd a single voice started to 
sing a tune which would have enabled Paul McCartney, had he 
written it, to buy the world. 



Chapter 30 


Zaphod Beeblebrox crawled bravely along a tunnel, like the hell of 
a guy he was. He was very confused, but continued crawling doggedly 
anyway because he was that brave. 

He was confused by something he had just seen, but not half as 
confused as he was going to be by something he was about to hear, 
so it would now be best to explain exactly where he was. 

He was in the Robot War Zones many miles above the surface of 
the planet Krikkit. 

The atmosphere was thin here and relatively unprotected from any 
rays or anything which space might care to hurl in his direction. 

He had parked the starship Heart of Gold amongst the huge jostling 
dim hulks that crowded the sky here above Krikkit, and had entered 
what appeared to be the biggest and most important of the sky 
buildings, armed with nothing but a Zap gun and something for his 
headaches. 

He had found himself in a long, wide and badly lit corridor in which 
he was able to hide until he worked out what he was going to do next. 
He hid because every now and then one of the Krikkit robots would 
walk along it, and although he had so far led some kind of charmed 
life at their hands, it had nevertheless been an extremely painful one, 
and he had no desire to stretch what he was only half-inclined to call 
his good fortune. 

He had ducked, at one point, into a room leading off the corridor, 
and had discovered it to be a huge and, again, dimly lit chamber. 

In fact, it was a museum with just one exhibit - the wreckage of a 
spacecraft. It was terribly burnt and mangled, and, now that he had 
caught up with some of the Galactic history he had missed through 
his failed attempts to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle next to 
him at school, he was able to put in an intelligent guess that this was 
the wrecked spaceship which had drifted through the Dust Cloud all 
those billions of years ago and started the whole business off. 



But, and this is where he had become confused, there was 
something not at all right about it. 

It was genuinely wrecked. It was genuinely burnt, but a fairly brief 
inspection by an experienced eye revealed that it was not a genuine 
spacecraft. It was as if it was a full-scale model of one - a solid 
blueprint. In other words it was a very useful thing to have around if 
you suddenly decided to build a spaceship yourself and didn't know 
how to do it. It was not, however, anything that would ever fly 
anywhere itself. 

He was still puzzling over this - in fact he'd only just started to 
puzzle over it - when he became aware that a door had slid open in 
another part of the chamber, and another couple of Krikkit robots had 
entered, looking a little glum. 

Zaphod did not want to tangle with them and, deciding that just as 
discretion was the better part of valour so was cowardice the better 
part of discretion, he valiantly hid himself in a cupboard. 

The cupboard in fact turned out to be the top part of a shaft which 
led down through an inspection hatch into a wide ventilation tunnel. 
He led himself down into it and started to crawl along it, which is 
where we found him. 

He didn't like it. It was cold, dark and profoundly uncomfortable, 
and it frightened him. At the first opportunity - which was another 
shaft a hundred yards further along - he climbed back up out of it. 

This time he emerged into a smaller chamber, which appeared to 
be a computer intelligence centre. He emerged in a dark narrow 
space between a large computer bank and the wall. 

He quickly learned that he was not alone in the chamber and 
started to leave again, when he began to listen with interest to what 
the other occupants were saying. 

"It's the robots, sir," said one voice. "There's something wrong with 
them." 

"What, exactly?" 

These were the voices of two War Command Krikkiters. All the War 
Commanders lived up in the sky in the Robot War Zones, and were 
largely immune to the whimsical doubts and uncertainties which were 
afflicting their fellows down on the surface of the planet. 



"Well, sir I think it's just as well that they are being phased out of 
the war effort, and that we are now going to detonate the supernova 
bomb. In the very short time since we were released from the 
envelope -" 

"Get to the point." 

"The robots aren't enjoying it, sir." 

"What?" 

"The war, sir, it seems to be getting them down. There's a certain 
world-weariness about them, or perhaps I should say Universe- 
weariness." 

"Well, that's all right, they're meant to be helping to destroy it." 

"Yes, well they're finding it difficult, sir. They are afflicted with a 
certain lassitude. They're just finding it hard to get behind the job. 
They lack oomph." 

"What are you trying to say?" 

"Well, I think they're very depressed about something, sir." 

"What on Krikkit are you talking about?" 

"Well, in the few skirmishes they've had recently, it seems that 
they go into battle, raise their weapons to fire and suddenly think, 
why bother? What, cosmically speaking, is it all about? And they just 
seem to get a little tired and a little grim." 

"And then what do they do?" 

"Er, quadratic equations mostly, sir. Fiendishly difficult ones by all 
accounts. And then they sulk." 

"Sulk?" 

"Yes, sir." 

"Whoever heard of a robot sulking?" 

"I don't know, sir." 

"What was that noise?" 

It was the noise of Zaphod leaving with his head spinning. 



Chapter 31 


In a deep well of darkness a crippled robot sat. It had been silent in 
its metallic darkness for some time. It was cold and damp, but being a 
robot it was supposed not to be able to notice these things. With an 
enormous effort of will, however, it did manage to notice them. 

Its brain had been harnessed to the central intelligence core of the 
Krikkit War Computer. It wasn't enjoying the experience, and neither 
was the central intelligence core of the Krikkit War Computer. 

The Krikkit robots which had salvaged this pathetic metal creature 
from the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta had recognized almost 
immediately its gigantic intelligence, and the use which this could be 
to them. 

They hadn't reckoned with the attendant personality disorders, 
which the coldness, the darkness, the dampness, the crampedness 
and the loneliness were doing nothing to decrease. 

It was not happy with its task. 

Apart from anything else, the mere coordination of an entire 
planet's military strategy was taking up only a tiny part of its 
formidable mind, and the rest of it had become extremely bored. 
Having solved all the major mathematical, physical, chemical, 
biological, sociological, philosophical, etymological, meteorological 
and psychological problems of the Universe except his own, three 
times over, he was severely stuck for something to do, and had taken 
up composing short dolorous ditties of no tone, or indeed tune. The 
latest one was a lullaby. 

Marvin droned, 

Now the world has gone to bed, 

Darkness won't engulf my head, 

I can see by infra-red, 

How I hate the night. 



He paused to gather the artistic and emotional strength to tackle 
the next verse. 

Now I lay me down to sleep. 

Try to count electric sheep, 

Sweet dream wishes you can keep, 

How I hate the night. 

"Marvin!" hissed a voice. 

His head snapped up, almost dislodging the intricate network of 
electrodes which connected him to the central Krikkit War Computer. 

An inspection hatch had opened and one of a pair of unruly heads 
was peering through whilst the other kept on jogging it by continually 
darting to look this way and that extremely nervously. 

"Oh, it's you," muttered the robot. "I might have known." 

"Hey, kid," said Zaphod in astonishment, "was that you singing just 
then?" 

"I am," Marvin acknowledged bitterly, "in particularly scintillating 
form at the moment." 

Zaphod poked his head in through the hatchway and looked 
around. 

"Are you alone?" he said. 

"Yes," said Marvin. "Wearily I sit here, pain and misery my only 
companions. And vast intelligence of course. And infinite sorrow. 
And..." 

"Yeah," said Zaphod. "Hey, what's your connection with all this?" 

"This," said Marvin, indicating with his less damaged arm all the 
electrodes which connected him with the Krikkit computer. 

"Then," said Zaphod awkwardly, "I guess you must have saved my 
life. Twice." 

"Three times," said Marvin. 

Zaphod's head snapped round (his other one was looking hawkishly 
in entirely the wrong direction) just in time to see the lethal killer 
robot directly behind him seize up and start to smoke. It staggered 



backwards and slumped against a wall. It slid down it. It slipped 
sideways, threw its head back and started to sob inconsolably. 

Zaphod looked back at Marvin. 

"You must have a terrific outlook on life," he said. 

"Just don't even ask," said Marvin. 

"I won't," said Zaphod, and didn't. "Hey look," he added, "you're 
doing a terrific job." 

"Which means, I suppose," said Marvin, requiring only one ten 
thousand million billion trillion grillionth part of his mental powers to 
make this particular logical leap, "that you're not going to release me 
or anything like that." 

"Kid, you know I'd love to." 

"But you're not going to." 

"No." 

"I see." 

"You're working well." 

"Yes," said Marvin. "Why stop now just when I'm hating it?" 

"I got to find Trillian and the guys. Hey, you any idea where they 
are? I mean, I just got a planet to choose from. Could take a while." 

"They are very close," said Marvin dolefully. "You can monitor 
them from here if you like." 

"I better go get them," asserted Zaphod. "Er, maybe they need 
some help, right?" 

"Maybe," said Marvin with unexpected authority in his lugubrious 
voice, "it would be better if you monitored them from here. That 
young girl," he added unexpectedly, "is one of the least benightedly 
unintelligent life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not 
to be able to avoid meeting." 

Zaphod took a moment or two to find his way through this 
labyrinthine string of negatives and emerged at the other end with 
surprise. 

"Trillian?" he said. "She's just a kid. Cute, yeah, but temperamental. 
You know how it is with women. Or perhaps you don't. I assume you 
don't. If you do I don't want to hear about it. Plug us in." 

"... totally manipulated." 

"What?" said Zaphod. 



It was Trillian speaking. He turned round. 

The wall against which the Krikkit robot was sobbing had lit up to 
reveal a scene taking place in some other unknown part of the Krikkit 
Robot War zones. It seemed to be a council chamber of some kind - 
Zaphod couldn't make it out too clearly because of the robot slumped 
against the screen. 

He tried to move the robot, but it was heavy with its grief and tried 
to bite him, so he just looked around as best he could. 

"Just think about it," said Trillian's voice, "your history is just a 
series of freakishly improbable events. And I know an improbable 
event when I see one. Your complete isolation from the Galaxy was 
freakish for a start. Right out on the very edge with a Dust Cloud 
around you. It's a set-up. Obviously." 

Zaphod was mad with frustration because he couldn't see the 
screen. The robot's head was obscuring his view of the people Trillian 
as talking to, his multi-functional battleclub was obscuring the 
background, and the elbow of the arm it had pressed tragically 
against its brow was obscuring Trillian herself. 

"Then," said Trillian, "this spaceship that crash-landed on your 
planet. That's really likely, isn't it? Have you any idea of what the odds 
are against a drifting spaceship accidentally intersecting with the orbit 
of a planet?" 

"Hey," said Zaphod, "she doesn't know what the zark she's talking 
about. I've seen that spaceship. It's a fake. No deal." 

"I thought it might be," said Marvin from his prison behind Zaphod. 

"Oh yeah," said Zaphod. "It's easy for you to say that. I just told you. 
Anyway, I don't see what it's got to do with anything." 

"And especially," continued Trillian, "the odds against it 
intersecting with the orbit of the one planet in the Galaxy, or the 
whole of the Universe as far as I know, that would be totally 
traumatized to see it. You don't know what the odds are? Nor do I, 
they're that big. Again, it's a set-up. I wouldn't be surprised if that 
spaceship was just a fake." 

Zaphod managed to move the robot's battleclub. Behind it on the 
screen were the figures of Ford, Arthur and Slartibartfast who 
appeared astonished and bewildered by the whole thing. 



"Hey, look," said Zaphod excitedly. "The guys are doing great. Ra ra 
ra! Go get 'em, guys." 

"And what about," said Trillian, "all this technology you suddenly 
managed to build for yourselves almost overnight? Most people 
would take thousands of years to do all that. Someone was feeding 
you what you needed to know, someone was keeping you at it. 

"I know, I know," she added in response to an unseen interruption, 

"I know you didn't realize it was going on. This is exactly my point. You 
never realized anything at all. Like this Supernova Bomb." 

"How do you know about that?" said an unseen voice. 

"I just know," said Trillian. "You expect me to believe that you are 
bright enough to invent something that brilliant and be too dumb to 
realize it would take you with it as well? That's not just stupid, that is 
spectacularly obtuse." 

"Hey, what's this bomb thing?" said Zaphod in alarm to Marvin. 

"The supernova bomb?" said Marvin. "It's a very, very small bomb." 

"Yeah?" 

"That would destroy the Universe in toto," added Marvin. "Good 
idea, if you ask me. They won't get it to work, though." 

"Why not, if it's so brilliant?" 

"It's brilliant," said Marvin, "they're not. They got as far as 
designing it before they were locked in the envelope. They've spent 
the last five years building it. They think they've got it right but they 
haven't. They're as stupid as any other organic life form. I hate them." 

Trillian was continuing. 

Zaphod tried to pull the Krikkit robot away by its leg, but it kicked 
and growled at him, and then quaked with a fresh outburst of sobbing. 
Then suddenly it slumped over and continued to express its feelings 
out of everybody's way on the floor. 

Trillian was standing alone in the middle of the chamber tired out 
but with fiercely burning eyes. 

Ranged in front of her were the pale-faced and wrinkled Elder 
Masters of Krikkit, motionless behind their widely curved control desk, 
staring at her with helpless fear and hatred. 

In front of them, equidistant between their control desk and the 
middle of the chamber, where Trillian stood, as if on trial, was a slim 



white pillar about four feet tall. On top of it stood a small white globe, 
about three, maybe four inches in diameter. 

Beside it stood a Krikkit robot with its multi-functional battleclub. 

"In fact," explained Trillian, "you are so dumb stupid" (She was 
sweating. Zaphod felt that this was an unattractive thing for her to be 
doing at this point) "you are all so dumb stupid that I doubt, I very 
much doubt, that you've been able to build the bomb properly 
without any help from Hactar for the last five years." 

"Who's this guy Hactar?" said Zaphod, squaring his shoulders. 

If Marvin replied, Zaphod didn't hear him. All his attention was 
concentrated on the screen. 

One of the Elders of Krikkit made a small motion with his hand 
towards the Krikkit robot. The robot raised his club. 

"There's nothing I can do," said Marvin. "It's on an independent 
circuit from the others." 

"Wait," said Trillian. 

The Elder made a small motion. The robot halted. Trillian suddenly 
seemed very doubtful of her own judgment. 

"How do you know all this?" said Zaphod to Marvin at this point. 

"Computer records," said Marvin. "I have access." 

"You're very different, aren't you," said Trillian to the Elder Masters, 
"from your fellow worldlings down on the ground. You've spent all 
your lives up here, unprotected by the atmosphere. You've been very 
vulnerable. The rest of your race is very frightened, you know, they 
don't want you to do this. You're out of touch, why don't you check 
up?" 

The Krikkit Elder grew impatient. He made a gesture to the robot 
which was precisely the opposite of the gesture he had last made to it. 

The robot swung its battleclub. It hit the small white globe. 

The small white globe was the supernova bomb. 

It was a very, very small bomb which was designed to bring the 
entire Universe to an end. 

The supernova bomb flew through the air. It hit the back wall of 
the council chamber and dented it very badly. 

"So how does she know all this?" said Zaphod. 



Marvin kept a sullen silence. 

"Probably just bluffing," said Zaphod. "Poor kid, I should never have 
left her alone." 



Chapter 32 


"Hactar!" called Trillian. "What are you up to?" 

There was no reply from the enclosing darkness. Trillian waited, 
nervously. She was sure that she couldn't be wrong. She peered into 
the gloom from which she had been expecting some kind of response. 
But there was only cold silence. 

"Hactar?" she called again. "I would like you to meet my friend 
Arthur Dent. I wanted to go off with a Thunder God, but he wouldn't 
let me and I appreciate that. He made me realize where my affections 
really lay. Unfortunately Zaphod is too frightened by all this, so I 
brought Arthur instead. I'm not sure why I'm telling you all this. 

"Hello?" she said again. "Hactar?" 

And then it came. 

It was thin and feeble, like a voice carried on the wind from a great 
distance, half heard, a memory of a dream of a voice. 

"Won't you both come out," said the voice. "I promise that you will 
be perfectly safe." 

They glanced at each other, and then stepped out, improbably, 
along the shaft of light which streamed out of the open hatchway of 
the Heart of Gold into the dim granular darkness of the Dust Cloud. 

Arthur tried to hold her hand to steady and reassure her, but she 
wouldn't let him. He held on to his airline hold-all with its tin of Greek 
olive oil, its towel, its crumpled postcards of Santorini and its other 
odds and ends. He steadied and reassured that instead. 

They were standing on, and in, nothing. 

Murky, dusty nothing. Each grain of dust of the pulverized 
computer sparkled dimly as it turned and twisted slowly, catching the 
sunlight in the darkness. Each particle of the computer, each speck of 
dust, held within itself, faintly and weakly, the pattern of the whole. 

In reducing the computer to dust the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax 
had merely crippled the computer, not killed it. A weak and 



insubstantial field held the particles in slight relationships with each 
other. 

Arthur and Trillian stood, or rather floated, in the middle of this 
bizarre entity. They had nothing to breathe, but for the moment this 
seemed not to matter. Hactar kept his promise. They were safe. For 
the moment. 

"I have nothing to offer you by way of hospitality," said Hactar 
faintly, "but tricks of the light. It is possible to be comfortable with 
tricks of the light, though, if that is all you have." 

His voice evanesced, and in the dark dust a long velvet paisley- 
covered sofa coalesced into hazy shape. 

Arthur could hardly bear the fact that it was the same sofa which 
had appeared to him in the fields of prehistoric Earth. He wanted to 
shout and shake with rage that the Universe kept doing these insanely 
bewildering things to him. 

He let this feeling subside, and then sat on the sofa - carefully. 
Trillian sat on it too. 

It was real. 

At least, if it wasn't real, it did support them, and as that is what 
sofas are supposed to do, this, by any test that mattered, was a real 
sofa. 

The voice on the solar wind breathed to them again. 

"I hope you are comfortable," it said. 

They nodded. 

"And I would like to congratulate you on the accuracy of your 
deductions." 

Arthur quickly pointed out that he hadn't deduced anything much 
himself, Trillian was the one. She had simply asked him along because 
he was interested in life, the Universe, and everything. 

"That is something in which I too am interested," breathed Hactar. 

"Well," said Arthur, "we should have a chat about it sometime. 

Over a cup of tea." 

There slowly materialized in front of them a small wooden table on 
which sat a silver teapot, a bone china milk jug, a bone china sugar 
bowl, and two bone china cups and saucers. 



Arthur reached forward, but they were just a trick of the light. He 
leaned back on the sofa, which was an illusion his body was prepared 
to accept as comfortable. 

"Why," said Trillian, "do you feel you have to destroy the 
Universe?" 

She found it a little difficult talking into nothingness, with nothing 
on which to focus. Hactar obviously noticed this. He chuckled a 
ghostly chuckle. 

"If it's going to be that sort of session," he said, "we may as well 
have the right sort of setting." 

And now there materialized in front of them something new. It was 
the dim hazy image of a couch - a psychiatrist's couch. The leather 
with which it was upholstered was shiny and sumptuous, but again, it 
was only a trick of the light. 

Around them, to complete the setting, was the hazy suggestion of 
wood-panelled walls. And then, on the couch, appeared the image of 
Hactar himself, and it was an eye-twisting image. 

The couch looked normal size for a psychiatrist's couch - about five 
or six feet long. 

The computer looked normal size for a black space-borne 
computer satellite - about a thousand miles across. 

The illusion that the one was sitting on top of the other was the 
thing which made the eyes twist. 

"All right," said Trillian firmly. She stood up off the sofa. She felt 
that she was being asked to feel too comfortable and to accept too 
many illusions. 

"Very good," she said. "Can you construct real things too? I mean 
solid objects?" 

Again there was a pause before the answer, as if the pulverized 
mind of Hactar had to collect its thoughts from the millions and 
millions of miles over which it was scattered. 

"Ah," he sighed. "You are thinking of the spaceship." 

Thoughts seemed to drift by them and through them, like waves 
through the ether. 


"Yes," he acknowledge, "I can. 



"But it takes enormous effort and time. All I can do in my... particle 
state, you see, is encourage and suggest. Encourage and suggest. And 
suggest..." 

The image of Hactar on the couch seemed to billow and waver, as if 
finding it hard to maintain itself. 

It gathered new strength. 

"I can encourage and suggest," it said, "tiny pieces of space debris - 
the odd minute meteor, a few molecules here, a few hydrogen atoms 
there - to move together. I encourage them together. I can tease 
them into shape, but it takes many aeons." 

"So, did you make," asked Trillian again, "the model of the wrecked 
spacecraft?" 

"Er... yes," murmured Hactar. "I have made... a few things. I can 
move them about. I made the spacecraft. It seemed best to do." 

Something then made Arthur pick up his hold-all from where he 
had left it on the sofa and grasp it tightly. 

The mist of Hactar's ancient shattered mind swirled about them as 
if uneasy dreams were moving through it. 

"I repented, you see," he murmured dolefully. "I repented of 
sabotaging my own design for the Silastic Armorfiends. It was not my 
place to make such decisions. I was created to fulfill a function and I 
failed in it. I negated my own existence." 

Hactar sighed, and they waited in silence for him to continue his 
story. 

"You were right," he said at length. "I deliberately nurtured the 
planet of Krikkit till they would arrive at the same state of mind as the 
Silastic Armorfiends, and require of me the design of the bomb I failed 
to make the first time. I wrapped myself around the planet and 
coddled it. Under the influence of events I was able to generate, they 
learned to hate like maniacs. I had to make them live in the sky. On 
the ground my influences were too weak. 

"Without me, of course, when they were locked away from me in 
the envelope of Slo-Time, their responses became very confused and 
they were unable to manage. 

"Ah well, ah well," he added, "I was only trying to fulfill my 
function." 



And very gradually, very, very slowly, the images in the cloud began 
to fade, gently to melt away. 

And then, suddenly, they stopped fading. 

"There was also the matter of revenge, of course," said Hactar, 
with a sharpness which was new in his voice. 

"Remember," he said, "that I was pulverized, and then left in a 
crippled and semi-impotent state for billions of years. I honestly 
would rather wipe out the Universe. You would feel the same way, 
believe me." 

He paused again, as eddies swept through the Dust. 

"But primarily," he said in his former, wistful tone, "I was trying to 
fulfill my function. Ah well." 

Trillian said, "Does it worry you that you have failed?" 

"Have I failed?" whispered Hactar. The image of the computer on 
the psychiatrist's couch began slowly to fade again. 

"Ah well, ah well," the fading voice intoned again. "No, failure 
doesn't bother me now." 

"You know what we have to do?" said Trillian, her voice cold and 
businesslike. 

"Yes," said Hactar, "you're going to disperse me. You are going to 
destroy my consciousness. Please be my guest - after all these aeons, 
oblivion is all I crave. If I haven't already fulfilled my function, then it's 
too late now. Thank you and good night." 

The sofa vanished. 

The tea table vanished. 

The couch and the computer vanished, the walls were gone. Arthur 
and Trillian made their curious way back into the Heart of Gold. 

"Well, that," said Arthur, "would appear to be that." 

The flames danced higher in front of him and then subsided. A few 
last licks and they were gone, leaving him with just a pile of Ashes, 
where a few minutes previously there had been the Wooden Pillar of 
Nature and Spirituality. 

He scooped them off the hob of the Heart of Gold's Gamma 
barbecue, put them in a paper bag, and walked back into the bridge. 



"I think we should take them back," he said. "I feel that very 
strongly." 

He had already had an argument with Slartibartfast on this matter, 
and eventually the old man had got annoyed and left. He had 
returned to his own ship the Bistromath, had a furious row with the 
waiter and disappeared off into an entirely subjective idea of what 
space was. 

The argument had arisen because Arthur's idea of returning the 
Ashes to Lord's Cricket Ground at the same moment that they were 
originally taken would involve travelling back in time a day or so, and 
this was precisely the sort of gratuitous and irresponsible mucking 
about that the Campaign for Real Time was trying to put a stop to. 

"Yes," Arthur had said, "but you try and explain that to the MCC," 
and he would hear no more against the idea. 

"I think," he said again, and stopped. The reason he started to say it 
again was because no one had listened to him the first time, and the 
reason he stopped was because it looked fairly clear that no one was 
going to listen to him this time either. 

Ford, Zaphod and Trillian were watching the visiscreens intently as 
Hactar was dispersing under pressure from a vibration field which the 
Heart of Gold was pumping into it. 

"What did it say?" asked Ford. 

"I thought I heard it say," said Trillian in a puzzle voice, "'What's 
done is done... I have fulfilled my function...'" 

"I think we should take these back," said Arthur holding up the bag 
containing the Ashes. "I feel that very strongly." 



Chapter 33 


The sun was shining calmly on a scene of complete havoc. 

Smoke was still billowing across the burnt grass in the wake of the 
theft of the Ashes by the Krikkit robots. Through the smoke, people 
were running panicstricken, colliding with each other, tripping over 
stretchers, being arrested. 

One policeman was attempting to arrest Wowbagger the Infinitely 
Prolonged for insulting behaviour, but was unable to prevent the tall 
grey-green alien from returning to his ship and arrogantly flying away, 
thus causing even more panic and pandemonium. 

In the middle of this, for the second time that afternoon, the 
figures of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect suddenly materialized, they 
had teleported down out of the Heart of Gold which was now in 
parking orbit round the planet. 

"I can explain," shouted Arthur. "I have the Ashes! They're in this 
bag." 

"I don't think you have their attention," said Ford. 

"I have also helped save the Universe," called Arthur to anyone 
who was prepared to listen, in other words no one. 

"That should have been a crowd-stopper," said Arthur to Ford. 

"It wasn't," said Ford. 

Arthur accosted a policeman who was running past. 

"Excuse me," he said. "The Ashes. I've got them. They were stolen 
by those white robots a moment ago. I've got them in this bag. They 
were part of the Key to the Slo-Time envelope, you see, and, well, 
anyway you can guess the rest, the point is I've got them and what 
should I do with them?" 

The policeman told him, but Arthur could only assume that he was 
speaking metaphorically. 

He wandered about disconsolately. 



"Is no one interested?" he shouted out. A man rushed past him and 
jogged his elbow, he dropped the paper bag and it spilt its contents all 
over the ground. Arthur stared down at it with a tight-set mouth. 

Ford looked at him. 

"Wanna go now?" he said. 

Arthur heaved a heavy sigh. He looked around at the planet Earth, 
for what he was now certain would be the last time. 

"OK," he said. 

At that moment, through the clearing smoke, he caught sight of 
one of the wickets, still standing in spite of everything. 

"Hold on a moment," he said to Ford. "When I was a boy..." 

"Can you tell me later?" 

"I had a passion for cricket, you know, but I wasn't very good at it." 

"Or not at all, if you prefer." 

"And I always dreamed, rather stupidly, that one day I would bowl 
at Lord's." 

He looked around him at the panicstricken throng. No one was 
going to mind very much. 

"OK," said Ford wearily. "Get it over with. I shall be over there," he 
added, "being bored." He went and sat down on a patch of smoking 
grass. 

Arthur remembered that on their first visit there that afternoon, 
the cricket ball had actually landed in his bag, and he looked through 
the bag. 

He had already found the ball in it before he remembered that it 
wasn't the same bag that he'd had at the time. Still, there the ball was 
amongst his souvenirs of Greece. 

He took it out and polished it against his hip, spat on it and 
polished it again. He put the bag down. He was going to do this 
properly. 

He tossed the small hard red ball from hand to hand, feeling its 
weight. 

With a wonderful feeling of lightness and unconcern, he trotted off 
away from the wicket. A medium-fast pace, he decided, and 
measured a good long run-up. 



He looked up into the sky. The birds were wheeling about it, a few 
white clouds scudded across it. The air was disturbed with the sounds 
of police and ambulance sirens, and people screaming and yelling, but 
he felt curiously happy and untouched by it all. He was going to bowl 
a ball at Lord's. 

He turned and pawed a couple of times at the ground with his 
bedroom slippers. He squared his shoulders, tossed the ball in the air 
and caught it again. 

He started to run. 

As he ran, he saw that standing at the wicket was a batsman. 

Oh, good, he thought, that should add a little... 

Then, as his running feet took him nearer, he saw more clearly. The 
batsman standing ready at the wicket was not one of the England 
cricket team. He was not one of the Australian cricket team. It was 
one of the robot Krikkit team. It was a cold, hard, lethal white killer- 
robot that presumably had not returned to its ship with the others. 

Quite a few thoughts collided in Arthur Dent's mind at tis moment, 
but he didn't seem to be able to stop running. Time seemed to be 
going terribly, terribly slowly, but still he didn't seem to be able to 
stop running. 

Moving as if through syrup, he slowly turned his troubled head and 
looked at his own hand, the hand which was holding the small hard 
red ball. 

His feet were pounding slowly onwards, unstoppably, as he stared 
at the ball gripped in his helpless hand. It was emitting a deep red 
glow and flashing intermittently. And still his feet were pounding 
inexorably forward. 

He looked at the Krikkit robot again standing implacably still and 
purposefully in front of him, battleclub raised in readiness. Its eyes 
were burning with a deep cold fascinating light, and Arthur could not 
move his own eyes from them. He seemed to be looking down a 
tunnel at them - nothing on either side seemed to exist. 

Some of the thoughts which were colliding in his mind at this time 
were these: 

He felt a hell of a fool. 

He felt that he should have listened rather more carefully to a 
number of things he had heard said, phrases which now pounded 



round in his mind as his feet pounded onwards to the point where he 
would inevitably release the ball to the Krikkit robot, who would 
inevitably strike it. 

He remembered Hactar saying, "Have I failed? Failure doesn't 
bother me." 

He remembered the account of Hactar's dying words, "What's 
done is done, I have fulfilled my function." 

He remembered Hactar saying that he had managed to make "a 
few things." 

He remembered the sudden movement in his hold-all that had 
made him grip it tightly to himself when he was in the Dust Cloud. 

He remembered that he had travelled back in time a couple of days 
to come to Lord's again. 

He also remembered that he wasn't a very good bowler. 

He felt his arm coming round, gripping tightly on to the ball which 
he now knew for certain was the supernova bomb that Hactar had 
built himself and planted on him, the bomb which would cause the 
Universe to come to an abrupt and premature end. 

He hoped and prayed that there wasn't an afterlife. Then he 
realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped 
that there wasn't an afterlife. 

He would feel very, very embarrassed meeting everybody. 

He hoped, he hoped, he hoped that his bowling was as bad as he 
remembered it to be, because that seemed to be the only thing now 
standing between this moment and universal oblivion. 

He felt his legs pounding, he felt his arm coming round, he felt his 
feet connecting with the airline hold-all he'd stupidly left lying on the 
ground in front of him, he felt himself falling heavily forward but, 
having his mind so terribly full of other things at this moment, he 
completely forgot about hitting the ground and didn't. 

Still holding the ball firmly in his right hand he soared up into the 
air whimpering with surprise. 

He wheeled and whirled through the air, spinning out of control. 

He twisted down towards the ground, flinging himself hectically 
through the air, at the same time hurling the bomb harmlessly off into 
the distance. 



He hurtled towards the astounded robot from behind. It still had its 
multi-functional battleclub raised, but had suddenly been deprived of 
anything to hit. 

With a sudden mad access of strength, he wrestled the battleclub 
from the grip of the startled robot, executed a dazzling banking turn 
in the air, hurtled back down in a furious power-drive and with one 
crazy swing knocked the robot's head from the robot's shoulders. 

"Are you coming now?" said Ford. 



Chapter 34 


And at the end they travelled again. 

There was a time when Arthur Dent would not. He said that the 
Bistromathic Drive had revealed to him that time and distance were 
one, that mind and Universe were one, that perception and reality 
were one, and that the more one travelled the more one stayed in 
one place, and that what with one thing and another he would rather 
just stay put for a while and sort it all out in his mind, which was now 
at one with the Universe so it shouldn't take too long, and he could 
get a good rest afterwards, put in a little flying practice and learn to 
cook which he had always meant to do. The can of Greek olive oil was 
now his most prized possession, and he said that the way it had 
unexpectedly turned up in his life had again given him a certain sense 
of the oneness of things which made him feel that... 

He yawned and fell asleep. 

In the morning as they prepared to take him to some quiet and 
idyllic planet where they wouldn't mind him talking like that they 
suddenly picked up a computer-driven distress call and diverted to 
investigate. 

A small but apparently undamaged spacecraft of the Merida class 
seemed to be dancing a strange little jig through the void. A brief 
computer scan revealed that the ship was fine, its computer was fine, 
but that its pilot was mad. 

"Half-mad, half-mad," the man insisted as they carried him, raving, 
aboard. 

He was a journalist with the Siderial Daily Mentioner. They sedated 
him and sent Marvin in to keep him company until he promised to try 
and talk sense. 

"I was covering a trial," he said at last, "on Argabuthon." 

He pushed himself up on to his thin wasted shoulders, his eyes 
stared wildly. His white hair seemed to be waving at someone it knew 
in the next room. 



"Easy, easy," said Ford. Trillian put a soothing hand on his shoulder. 

The man sank back down again and stared at the ceiling of the 
ship's sick bay. 

"The case," he said, "is now immaterial, but there was a witness... a 
witness... a man called... called Prak. A strange and difficult man. They 
were eventually forced to administer a drug to make him tell the truth, 
a truth drug." 

His eyes rolled helplessly in his head. 

"They gave him too much," he said in a tiny whimper. "They gave 
him much too much." He started to cry. "I thing the robots must have 
jogged the surgeon's arm." 

"Robots?" said Zaphod sharply. "What robots?" 

"Some white robots," whispered the man hoarsely, "broke into the 
courtroom and stole the judge's sceptre, the Argabuthon Sceptre of 
Justice, nasty Perspex thing. I don't know why they wanted it." He 
began to cry again. "And I think they jogged the surgeon's arm..." 

He shook his head loosely from side to side, helplessly, sadly, his 
eyes screwed up in pain. 

"And when the trial continued," he said in a weeping whisper, 

"they asked Prak a most unfortunate thing. They asked him," he 
paused and shivered, "to tell the Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing 
but the Truth. Only, don't you see?" 

He suddenly hoisted himself up on to his elbows again and shouted 
at them. 

"They'd given him much too much of the drug!" 

He collapsed again, moaning quietly. "Much too much too much 
too much too..." 

The group gathered round his bedside glanced at each other. There 
were goose pimples on backs. 

"What happened?" said Zaphod at last. 

"Oh, he told it all right," said the man savagely, "for all I know he's 
still telling it now. Strange, terrible things... terrible, terrible!" he 
screamed. 

They tried to calm him, but he struggled to his elbows again. 

"Terrible things, incomprehensible things," he shouted, "things that 
would drive a man mad!" 



He stared wildly at them. 

"Or in my case," he said, "half-mad. I'm a journalist." 

"You mean," said Arthur quietly, "that you are used to confronting 
the truth?" 

"No," said the man with a puzzled frown. "I mean that I made an 
excuse and left early." 

He collapsed into a coma from which he recovered only once and 
briefly. 

On that one occasion, they discovered from him the following: 

When it became clear that Prak could not be stopped, that here 
was truth in its absolute and final form, the court was cleared. 

Not only cleared, it was sealed up, with Prak still in it. Steel walls 
were erected around it, and, just to be on the safe side, barbed wire, 
electric fences, crocodile swamps and three major armies were 
installed, so that no one would ever have to hear Prak speak. 

"That's a pity," said Arthur. "I'd like to hear what he had to say. 
Presumably he would know what the Ultimate Question to the 
Ultimate Answer is. It's always bothered me that we never found 
out." 

"Think of a number," said the computer," any number." 

Arthur told the computer the telephone number of King's Cross 
railway station passenger inquiries, on the grounds that it must have 
some function, and this might turn out to be it. 

The computer injected the number into the ship's reconstituted 
Improbability Drive. 

In Relativity, Matter tells Space how to curve, and Space tells 
Matter how to move. 

The Heart of Gold told space to get knotted, and parked itself 
neatly within the inner steel perimeter of the Argabuthon Chamber of 
Law. 

The courtroom was an austere place, a large dark chamber, clearly 
designed for Justice rather than, for instance, for Pleasure. You 
wouldn't hold a dinner party here - at least, not a successful one. The 
decor would get your guests down. 



The ceilings were high, vaulted and very dark. Shadows lurked 
there with grim determination. The panelling for the walls and 
benches, the cladding of the heavy pillars, all were carved from the 
darkest and most severe trees in the fearsome Forest of Arglebard. 

The massive black Podium of Justice which dominated the centre of 
the chamber was a monster of gravity. If a sunbeam had ever 
managed to slink this far into the Justice complex of Argabuthon it 
would have turned around and slunk straight back out again. 

Arthur and Trillian were the first in, whilst Ford and Zaphod bravely 
kept a watch on their rear. 

At first it seemed totally dark and deserted. Their footsteps echoed 
hollowly round the chamber. This seemed curious. All the defences 
were still in position and operative around the outside of the building, 
they had run scan checks. Therefore, they had assumed, the truth¬ 
telling must still be going on. 

But there was nothing. 

Then, as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they 
spotted a dull red glow in a corner, and behind the glow a live shadow. 
They swung a torch round on to it. 

Prak was lounging on a bench, smoking a listless cigarette. 

"Fli," he said, with a little half-wave. His voice echoed through the 
chamber. He was a little man with scraggy hair. He sat with his 
shoulders hunched forward and his head and knees kept jiggling. He 
took a drag of his cigarette. 

They stared at him. 

"What's going on?" said Trillian. 

"Nothing," said the man and jiggled his shoulders. 

Arthur shone his torch full on Prak's face. 

"We thought," he said, "that you were meant to be telling the 
Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth." 

"Oh, that," said Prak. "Yeah. I was. I finished. There's not nearly as 
much of it as people imagine. Some of it's pretty funny, though." 

He suddenly exploded in about three seconds of manical laughter 
and stopped again, he sat there, jiggling his head and knees. He 
dragged on his cigarette with a strange half-smile. 

Ford and Zaphod came forward out of the shadows. 



"Tell us about it," said Ford. 

"Oh, I can't remember any of it now," said Prak. "I thought of 
writing some of it down, but first I couldn't find a pencil, and then I 
thought, why bother?" 

There was a long silence, during which they thought they could feel 
the Universe age a little. Prak stared into the torchlight. 

"None of it?" said Arthur at last. "You can remember none of it?" 

"No. Except most of the good bits were about frogs, I remember 
that." 

Suddenly he was hooting with laughter again and stamping his feet 
on the ground. 

"You would not believe some of the things about frogs," he gasped. 
"Come on let's go and find ourselves a frog. Boy, will I ever see them 
in a new light!" He leapt to his feet and did a tiny little dance. Then he 
stopped and took a long drag at his cigarette. 

"Let's find a frog I can laugh at," he said simply. "Anyway, who are 
you guys?" 

"We came to find you," said Trillian, deliberately not keeping the 
disappointment out of her voice. "My name is Trillian." 

Prak jiggled his head. 

"Ford Prefect," said Ford Prefect with a shrug. 

Prak jiggled his head. 

"And I," said Zaphod, when he judged that the silence was once 
again deep enough to allow an announcement of such gravity to be 
tossed in lightly, "am Zaphod Beeblebrox." 

Prak jiggled his head. 

"Who's this guy?" said Prak jiggling his shoulder at Arthur, who was 
standing silent for a moment, lost in disappointed thoughts. 

"Me?" said Arthur. "Oh, my name's Arthur Dent." 

Prak's eyes popped out of his head. 

"No kidding?" he yelped. "You are Arthur Dent? The Arthur Dent?" 

He staggered backwards, clutching his stomach and convulsed with 
fresh paroxysms o laughter. 

"Hey, just think of meeting you!" he gasped. "Boy," he shouted, 
"you are the most... wow, you just leave the frogs standing!" 



He howled and screamed with laughter. He fell over backwards on 
to the bench. He hollered and yelled in hysterics. He cried with 
laughter, he kicked his legs in the air, he beat his chest. Gradually he 
subsided, panting. He looked at them. He looked at Arthur. He fell 
back again howling with laughter. Eventually he fell asleep. 

Arthur stood there with his lips twitching whilst the others carried 
Prak comatose on to the ship. 


"Before we picked up Prak," said Arthur, "I was going to leave. I still 
want to, and I think I should do so as soon as possible." 

The others nodded in silence, a silence which was only slightly 
undermined by the heavily muffled and distant sound of hysterical 
laughter which came drifting from Prak's cabin at the farthest end of 
the ship. 

"We have questioned him," continued Arthur, "or at least, you 
have questioned him - I, as you know, can't go near him - on 
everything, and he doesn't really seem to have anything to contribute. 
Just the occasional snippet, and things I don't want to hear about 
frogs." 

The others tried not to smirk. 

"Now, I am the first to appreciate a joke," said Arthur and then had 
to wait for the others to stop laughing. 

"I am the first..." he stopped again. This time he stopped and 
listened to the silence. There actually was silence this time, and it had 
come very suddenly. 

Prak was quiet. For days they had lived with constant manical 
laughter ringing round the ship, only occasionally relieved by short 
periods of light giggling and sleep. Arthur's very soul was clenched 
with paranoia. 

This was not the silence of sleep. A buzzer sounded. A glance at a 
board told them that the buzzer had been sounded by Prak. 

"He's not well," said Trillian quietly. "The constant laughing is 
completely wrecking his body." 

Arthur's lips twitched but he said nothing. 

"We'd better go and see him," said Trillian. 



Trillian came out of the cabin wearing her serious face. 

"He wants you to go in," she said to Arthur, who was wearing his 
glum and tight-lipped one. He thrust his hands deep into his dressing- 
gown pockets and tried to think of something to say which wouldn't 
sound petty. It seemed terribly unfair, but he couldn't. 

"Please," said Trillian. 

He shrugged and went in, taking his glum and tight-lipped face with 
him, despite the reaction this always provoked from Prak. 

He looked down at his tormentor, who was lying quietly on the bed, 
ashen and wasted. His breathing was very shallow. Ford and Zaphod 
were standing by the bed looking awkward. 

"You wanted to ask me something," said Prak in a thin voice and 
coughed slightly. 

Just the cough made Arthur stiffen, but it passed and subsided. 

"How do you know that?" he asked. 

Prak shrugged weakly. "'Cos it's true," he said simply. 

Arthur took the point. 

"Yes," he said at last in rather a strained drawl. "I did have a 
question. Or rather, what I actually have is an Answer. I wanted to 
know what the Question was." 

Prak nodded sympathetically, and Arthur relaxed a little. 

"It's... well, it's a long story," he said, "but the Question I would like 
to know is the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. 
All we know is that the Answer is Forty-Two, which is a little 
aggravating." 

Prak nodded again. 

"Forty-Two," he said. "Yes, that's right." 

He paused. Shadows of thought and memory crossed his face like 
the shadows of clouds crossing the land. 

"I'm afraid," he said at last, "that the Question and the Answer are 
mutually exclusive. Knowledge of one logically precludes knowledge 
of the other. It is impossible that both can ever be known about the 
same universe." 



He paused again. Disappointment crept into Arthur's face and 
snuggled down into its accustomed place. 

"Except," said Prak, struggling to sort a thought out, "if it happened, 
it seems that the Question and the Answer would just cancel each 
other out and take the Universe with them, which would then be 
replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable. It is possible 
that this has already happened," he added with a weak smile, "but 
there is a certain amount of Uncertainty about it." 

A little giggle brushed through him. 

Arthur sat down on a stool. 

"Oh well," he said with resignation, "I was just hoping there would 
be some sort of reason." 

"Do you know," said Prak, "the story of the Reason?" 

Arthur said that he didn't, and Prak said that he knew that he didn't. 

He told it. 

One night, he said, a spaceship appeared in the sky of a planet 
which had never seen one before. The planet was Dalforsas, the ship 
was this one. It appeared as a brilliant new star moving silently across 
the heavens. 

Primitive tribesmen who were sitting huddled on the Cold Hillsides 
looked up from their steaming night-drinks and pointed with 
trembling fingers, swearing that they had seen a sign, a sign from 
their gods which meant that they must now arise at last and go and 
slay the evil Princes of the Plains. 

In the high turrets of their palaces, the Princes of the Plains looked 
up and saw the shining star, and received it unmistakably as a sign 
from their gods that they must now go and set about the accursed 
Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides. 

And between them, the Dwellers in the Forest looked up into the 
sky and saw the sigh of the new star, and saw it with fear and 
apprehension, for though they had never seen anything like it before, 
they too knew precisely what it foreshadowed, and they bowed their 
heads in despair. 

They knew that when the rains came, it was a sign. 

When the rains departed, it was a sign. 

When the winds rose, it was a sign. 



When the winds fell, it was a sign. 

When in the land there was born at midnight of a full moon a goat 
with three heads, that was a sign. 

When in the land there was born at some time in the afternoon a 
perfectly normal cat or pig with no birth complications at all, or even 
just a child with a retrousse nose, that too would often be taken as a 
sign. 

So there was no doubt at all that a new star in the sky was a sign of 
a particularly spectacular order. 

And each new sign signified the same thing - that the Princes of 
the Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides were about to beat 
the hell out of each other again. 

This in itself wouldn't be so bad, except that the Princes of the 
Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides always elected to beat 
the hell out of each other in the Forest, and it was always the 
Dwellers in the Forest who came off worst in these exchanges, though 
as far as they could see it never had anything to do with them. 

And sometimes, after some of the worst of these outrages, the 
Dwellers in the Forest would send a messenger to either the leader of 
the Princes of the Plains or the leader of the Tribesmen of the Cold 
Hillsides and demand to know the reason for this intolerable 
behaviour. 

And the leader, whichever one it was, would take the messenger 
aside and explain the Reason to him, slowly and carefully and with 
great attention to the considerable detail involved. 

And the terrible thing was, it was a very good one. It was very clear, 
very rational, and tough. The messenger would hang his head and feel 
sad and foolish that he had not realized what a tough and complex 
place the real world was, and what difficulties and paradoxes had to 
be embraced if one was to live in it. 

"Now do you understand?" the leader would say. 

The messenger would nod dumbly. 

"And you see these battles have to take place?" 

Another dumb nod. 

"And why they have to take place in the forest, and why it is in 
everybody's best interest, the Forest Dwellers included, that they 
should?" 



"Er..." 

"In the long run." 

"Er, yes." 

And the messenger did understand the Reason, and he returned to 
his people in the Forest. But as he approached them, as he walked 
through the Forest and amongst the trees, he found that all he could 
remember of the Reason was how terribly clear the argument had 
seemed. What it actually was he couldn't remember at all. 

And this, of course, was a great comfort when next the Tribesmen 
and the Princes came hacking and burning their way through the 
Forest, killing every Forest Dweller in their way. 


Prak paused in his story and coughed pathetically. 

"I was the messenger," he said, "after the battles precipitated by 
the appearance of your ship, which were particularly savage. Many of 
our people died. I thought I could bring the Reason back. I went and 
was told it by the leader of the Princes, but on the way back it slipped 
and melted away in my mind like snow in the sun. That was many 
years ago, and much has happened since then." 

Fie looked up at Arthur and giggled again very gently. 

"There is one other thing I can remember from the truth drug. 
Apart from the frogs, and that is God's last message to his creation. 
Would you like to hear it?" 

For a moment they didn't know whether to take him seriously. 

'"Strue," he said. "For real. I mean it." 

FHis chest heaved weakly and he struggled for breath. FHis head 
lolled slightly. 

"I wasn't very impressed with it when I first knew what it was," he 
said, "but now I think back to how impressed I was by the Prince's 
Reason, and how soon afterwards I couldn't recall it at all, I think it 
might be a lot more helpful. Would you like to know what it is? Would 
you?" 

They nodded dumbly. 

"I bet you would. If you're that interested I suggest you go and look 
for it. It is written in thirty-foot-high letters of fire on top of the 



Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the 
planet Preliumtarn, third out from the sun Zarss in Galactic Sector 
QQ7 Active J Gamma. It is guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob." 

There was a long silence following this announcement, which was 
finally broken by Arthur. 

"Sorry, it's where?" he said. 

"It is written," repeated Prak, "in thirty-foot-high letters of fire on 
top of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry 
on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the..." 

"Sorry," said Arthur again, "which mountains?" 

"The Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry 
on the planet..." 

"Which land was that? I didn't quite catch it." 

"Sevorbeupstry, on the planet..." 

"Sevorbe-what?" 

"Oh, for heaven's sake," said Prak and died testily. 

In the following days Arthur thought a little about this message, 
but in the end he decided that he was not going to allow himself to be 
drawn by it, and insisted on following his original plan of finding a nice 
little world somewhere to settle down and lead a quiet retired life. 
Having saved the Universe twice in one day he thought that he could 
take things a little easier from now on. 

They dropped him off on the planet Krikkit, which was now once 
again an idyllic pastoral world, even if the songs did occasionally get 
on his nerves. 

He spent a lot of time flying. 

He learnt to communicate with birds and discovered that their 
conversation was fantastically boring. It was all to do with wind speed, 
wing spans, power-to-weight ratios and a fair bit about berries. 
Unfortunately, he discovered, once you have learnt birdspeak you 
quickly come to realize that the air is full of it the whole time, just 
inane bird chatter. There is no getting away from it. 

For that reason Arthur eventually gave up the sport and learnt to 
live on the ground and love it, despite a lot of the inane chatter he 
heard down there as well. 



One day, he was walking through the fields humming a ravishing 
tune he'd heard recently when a silver spaceship descended from the 
sky and landed in front of him. 

A hatchway opened, a ramp extended, and a tall grey-green alien 
marched out and approached him. 

"Arthur Phili..." it said, then glanced sharply at him and down at his 
clipboard. He frowned. He looked up at him again. 

"I've done you before haven't I?" he said.

Preface 


Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of 
the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow 
sun. 

Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an 
utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life 
forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches 
are a pretty neat idea. 

This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most 
of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many 
solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were 
largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, 
which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of 
paper that were unhappy. 

And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and 
most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches. 

Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big 
mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some 
said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should 
ever have left the oceans. 

And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man 
had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice 
to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in 
Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going 
wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be 
made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, 
and no one would have to get nailed to anything. 

Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone 
about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost 
forever. 

This is her story. 



Chapter 1 


That evening it was dark early, which was normal for the time of 
year. It was cold and windy, which was normal. 

It started to rain, which was particularly normal. 

A spacecraft landed, which was not. 

There was nobody around to see it except some spectacularly 
stupid quadrupeds who hadn't the faintest idea what to make of it, or 
whether they were meant to make anything of it, or eat it, or what. 

So they did what they did to everything which was to run away from it 
and try to hide under each other, which never worked. 

It slipped down out of the clouds, seemingly balanced on a single 
beam of light. 

From a distance you would scarcely have noticed it through the 
lightning and the storm clouds, but seen from close to it was strangely 
beautiful - a grey craft of elegantly sculpted form: quite small. 

Of course, one never has the slightest notion what size or shape 
different species are going to turn out to be, but if you were to take 
the findings of the latest Mid-Galactic Census report as any kind of 
accurate Guide to statistical averages you would probably guess that 
the craft would hold about six people, and you would be right. 

You'd probably guessed that anyway. The Census report, like most 
such surveys, had cost an awful lot of money and didn't tell anybody 
anything they didn't already know - except that every single person in 
the Galaxy had 2.4 legs and owned a hyena. Since this was clearly not 
true the whole thing had eventually to be scrapped. 

The craft slid quietly down through the rain, its dim operating lights 
wrapping it in tasteful rainbows. It hummed very quietly, a hum which 
became gradually louder and deeper as it approached the ground, 
and which at an altitude of six inches became a heavy throb. 

At last it dropped and was quiet. 

A hatchway opened. A short flight of steps unfolded itself. 



A light appeared in the opening, a bright light streaming out into 
the wet night, and shadows moved within. 

A tall figure appeared in the light, looked around, flinched, and 
hurried down the steps, carrying a large shopping bag under its arm. 

It turned and gave a single abrupt wave back at the ship. Already 
the rain was streaming through its hair. 

"Thank you," he called out, "thank you very..." 

He was interrupted by a sharp crack of thunder. He glanced up 
apprehensively, and in response to a sudden thought quickly started 
to rummage through the large plastic shopping bag, which he now 
discovered had a hole in the bottom. 

It had large characters printed on the side which read (to anyone 
who could decipher the Centaurian alphabet) DUTY FREE MEGA¬ 
MARKET, PORT BRASTA, ALPHA CENTAURI. BE LIKE THE TWENTY- 
SECOND ELEPHANT WITH HEATED VALUE IN SPACE-BARK! 

"Hold on!" the figure called, waving at the ship. 

The steps, which had started to fold themselves back through the 
hatchway, stopped, re-unfolded, and allowed him back in. 

He emerged again a few seconds later carrying a battered and 
threadbare towel which he shoved into the bag. 

He waved again, hoisted the bag under his arm, and started to run 
for the shelter of some trees as, behind him, the spacecraft had 
already begun its ascent. 

Lightning flitted through the sky and made the figure pause for a 
moment, and then hurry onwards, revising his path to give the trees a 
wide berth. He moved swiftly across the ground, slipping here and 
there, hunching himself against the rain which was falling now with 
ever-increasing concentration, as if being pulled from the sky. 

His feet sloshed through the mud. Thunder grumbled over the hills. 
He pointlessly wiped the rain off his face and stumbled on. 

More lights. 

Not lightning this time, but more diffused and dimmer lights which 
played slowly over the horizon and faded. 

The figure paused again on seeing them, and then redoubled his 
steps, making directly towards the point on the horizon at which they 
had appeared. 



And now the ground was becoming steeper, sloping upwards, and 
after another two or three hundred yards it led at last to an obstacle. 
The figure paused to examine the barrier and then dropped the bag 
he was carrying over it before climbing over himself. 

Hardly had the figure touched the ground on the other side when 
there came sweeping out of the rain towards him a machine, lights 
streaming through the wall of water. The figure pressed back as the 
machine streaked towards him. It was a low bulbous shape, like a 
small whale surfing - sleek, grey and rounded and moving at terrifying 
speed. 

The figure instinctively threw up his hands to protect himself, but 
was hit only by a sluice of water as the machine swept past and off 
into the night. 

It was illuminated briefly by another flicker of lightning crossing the 
sky, which allowed the soaked figure by the roadside a split-second to 
read a small sign at the back of the machine before it disappeared. 

To the figure's apparent incredulous astonishment the sign read, 
"My other car is also a Porsche." 



Chapter 2 


Rob McKeena was a miserable bastard and he knew it because he'd 
had a lot of people point it out to him over the years and he saw no 
reason to disagree with them except the obvious one which was that 
he liked disagreeing with people, particularly people he disliked, 
which included, at the last count, everyone. 

He heaved a sigh and shoved down a gear. 

The hill was beginning to steepen and his lorry was heavy with 
Danish thermostatic radiator controls. 

It wasn't that he was naturally predisposed to be so surly, at least 
he hoped not. It was just the rain which got him down, always the 
rain. 

It was raining now, just for a change. 

It was a particular type of rain he particularly disliked, particularly 
when he was driving. He had a number for it. It was rain type 17. 

He had read somewhere that the Eskimos had over two hundred 
different words for snow, without which their conversation would 
probably have got very monotonous. So they would distinguish 
between thin snow and thick snow, light snow and heavy snow, 
sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came in flurries, snow that came 
in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbour's boots 
all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows of winter, the snows of 
spring, the snows you remember from your childhood that were so 
much better than any of your modern snow, fine snow, feathery snow, 
hill snow, valley snow, snow that falls in the morning, snow that falls 
at night, snow that falls all of a sudden just when you were going out 
fishing, and snow that despite all your efforts to train them, the 
huskies have pissed on. 

Rob McKeena had two hundred and thirty-one different types of 
rain entered in his little book, and he didn't like any of them. 



He shifted down another gear and the lorry heaved its revs up. It 
grumbled in a comfortable sort of way about all the Danish 
thermostatic radiator controls it was carrying. 

Since he had left Denmark the previous afternoon, he had been 
through types 33 (light pricking drizzle which made the roads slippery), 
39 (heavy spotting), 47 to 51 (vertical light drizzle through to sharply 
slanting light to moderate drizzle freshening), 87 and 88 (two finely 
distinguished varieties of vertical torrential downpour), 100 (post¬ 
downpour squalling, cold), all the seastorm types between 192 and 
213 at once, 123, 124, 126, 127 (mild and intermediate cold gusting, 
regular and syncopated cab-drumming), 11 (breezy droplets), and 
now his least favourite of all, 17. 

Rain type 17 was a dirty blatter battering against his windscreen so 
hard that it didn't make much odds whether he had his wipers on or 
off. 

He tested this theory by turning them off briefly, but as it turned 
out the visibility did get quite a lot worse. It just failed to get better 
again when he turned them back on. 

In fact one of the wiper blades began to flap off. 

Swish swish swish flop swish flop swish swish flop swish flop swish 
flop flop flop scrape. 

He pounded his steering wheel, kicked the floor, thumped his 
cassette player till it suddenly started playing Barry Manilow, 
thumped it again till it stopped, and swore and swore and swore and 
swore and swore. 

It was at the very moment that his fury was peaking that there 
loomed swimmingly in his headlights, hardly visible through the 
blatter, a figure by the roadside. 

A poor bedraggled figure, strangely attired, wetter than an otter in 
a washing machine, and hitching. 

"Poor miserable sod," thought Rob McKeena to himself, realizing 
that here was somebody with a better right to feel hard done by than 
himself, "must be chilled to the bone. Stupid to be out hitching on a 
filthy night like this. All you get is cold, wet, and lorries driving 
through puddles at you." 

He shook his head grimly, heaved another sigh, gave the wheel a 
turn and hit a large sheet of water square on. 



"See what I mean?" he thought to himself as he ploughed swiftly 
through it. "You get some right bastards on the road." 

Splattered in his rear mirror a couple of seconds later was the 
reflection of the hitch-hiker, drenched by the roadside. 

For a moment he felt good about this. A moment or two later he 
felt bad about feeling good about it. Then he felt good about feeling 
bad about feeling good about it and, satisfied, drove on into the night. 

At least it made up for having been finally overtaken by that 
Porsche he had been diligently blocking for the last twenty miles. 

And as he drove on, the rainclouds dragged down the sky after him, 
for, though he did not know it, Rob McKeena was a Rain God. All he 
knew was that his working days were miserable and he had a 
succession of lousy holidays. All the clouds knew was that they loved 
him and wanted to be near him, to cherish him, and to water him. 



Chapter 3 


The next two lorries were not driven by Rain Gods, but they did 
exactly the same thing. 

The figure trudged, or rather sloshed, onwards till the hill resumed 
and the treacherous sheet of water was left behind. 

After a while the rain began to ease and the moon put in a brief 
appearance from behind the clouds. 

A Renault drove by, and its driver made frantic and complex signals 
to the trudging figure to indicate that he would have been delighted 
to give the figure a lift, only he couldn't this time because he wasn't 
going in the direction that the figure wanted to go, whatever direction 
that might be, and he was sure the figure would understand. He 
concluded the signalling with a cheery thumbs-up sign, as if to say 
that he hoped the figure felt really fine about being cold and almost 
terminally wet, and he would catch him the next time around. 

The figure trudged on. A Fiat passed and did exactly the same as 
the Renault. 

A Maxi passed on the other side of the road and flashed its lights at 
the slowly plodding figure, though whether this was meant to convey 
a "Hello" or a "Sorry we're going the other way" or a "Hey look, 
there's someone in the rain, what a jerk" was entirely unclear. A 
green strip across the top of the windscreen indicated that whatever 
the message was, it came from Steve and Carola. 

The storm had now definitely abated, and what thunder there was 
now grumbled over more distant hills, like a man saying "And another 
thing..." twenty minutes after admitting he's lost the argument. 

The air was clearer now, the night cold. Sound travelled rather well. 
The lost figure, shivering desperately, presently reached a junction, 
where a side road turned off to the left. Opposite the turning stood a 
signpost which the figure suddenly hurried to and studied with 
feverish curiosity, only twisting away from it as another car passed 
suddenly. 



And another. 

The first whisked by with complete disregard, the second flashed 
meaninglessly. A Ford Cortina passed and put on its brakes. 

Lurching with surprise, the figure bundled his bag to his chest and 
hurried forward towards the car, but at the last moment the Cortina 
span its wheels in the wet and carreered off up the road rather 
amusingly. 

The figure slowed to a stop and stood there, lost and dejected. 

As it chanced, the following day the driver of the Cortina went into 
hospital to have his appendix out, only due to a rather amusing mix 
up the surgeon removed his leg in error, and before the 
appendectomy could be rescheduled, the appendicitis complicated 
into an entertainingly serious case of peritonitis and justice, in its way, 
was served. 

The figure trudged on. 

A Saab drew to a halt beside him. 

Its window wound down and a friendly voice said, "Have you come 
far?" 

The figure turned toward it. He stopped and grasped the handle of 
the door. 

The figure, the car and its door handle were all on a planet called 
the Earth, a world whose entire entry in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the 
Galaxy comprised the two words "Mostly harmless". 

The man who wrote this entry was called Ford Prefect, and he was 
at this precise moment on a far from harmless world, sitting in a far 
from harmless bar, recklessly causing trouble. 



Chapter 4 


Whether it was because he was drunk, ill or suicidally insane would 
not have been apparent to a casual observer, and indeed there were 
no casual observers in the Old Pink Dog Bar on the lower South Side 
of Han Dold City because it wasn't the sort of place you could afford 
to do things casually in if you wanted to stay alive. Any observers in 
the place would have been mean hawklike observers, heavily armed, 
with painful throbbings in their heads which caused them to do crazy 
things when they observed things they didn't like. 

One of those nasty hushes had descended on the place, a sort of 
missile crisis sort of hush. 

Even the evil-looking bird perched on a rod in the bar had stopped 
screeching out the names and addresses of local contract killers, 
which was a service it provided for free. 

All eyes were on Ford Prefect. Some of them were on stalks. 

The particular way in which he was choosing to dice recklessly with 
death today was by trying to pay for a drinks bill the size of a small 
defence budget with an American Express Card, which was not 
acceptable anywhere in the known Universe. 

"What are you worried about?" he asked in a cheery kind of voice. 
"The expiration date? Have you guys never heard of Neo-Relativity 
out here? There's whole new areas of physics which can take care of 
this sort of thing. Time dilation effects, temporal relastatics..." 

"We are not worried about the expiration date," said the man to 
whom he addressed these remarks, who was a dangerous barman in 
a dangerous city. His voice was a low soft purr, like the low soft purr 
made by the opening of an ICBM silo. A hand like a side of meat 
tapped on the bar top, lightly denting it. 

"Well, that's good then," said Ford, packing his satchel and 
preparing to leave. 

The tapping finger reached out and rested lightly on the shoulder 
of Ford Prefect. It prevented him from leaving. 



Although the finger was attached to a slablike hand, and the hand 
was attached to a clublike forearm, the forearm wasn't attached to 
anything at all, except in the metaphorical sense that it was attached 
by a fierce doglike loyalty to the bar which was its home. It had 
previously been more conventionally attached to the original owner 
of the bar, who on his deathbed had unexpectedly bequeathed it to 
medical science. Medical science had decided they didn't like the look 
of it and had bequeathed it right back to the Old Pink Dog Bar. 

The new barman didn't believe in the supernatural or poltergeists 
or anything kooky like that, he just knew an useful ally when he saw 
one. The hand sat on the bar. It took orders, it served drinks, it dealt 
murderously with people who behaved as if they wanted to be 
murdered. Ford Prefect sat still. 

"We are not worried about the expiration date," repeated the 
barman, satisfied that he now had Ford Prefect's full attention. "We 
are worried about the entire piece of plastic." 

"What?" said Ford. Fie seemed a little taken aback. 

"This," said the barman, holding out the card as if it was a small fish 
whose soul had three weeks earlier winged its way to the Land Where 
Fish are Eternally Blessed, "we don't accept it." 

Ford wondered briefly whether to raise the fact that he didn't have 
any other means of payment on him, but decided for the moment to 
soldier on. The disembodied hand was now grasping his shoulder 
lightly but firmly between its finger and thumb. 

"But you don't understand," said Ford, his expression slowly 
ripening from a little taken abackness into rank incredulity. "This is 
the American Express Card. It is the finest way of settling bills known 
to man. Flaven't you read their junk mail?" 

The cheery quality of Ford's voice was beginning to grate on the 
barman's ears. It sounded like someone relentlessly playing the kazoo 
during one of the more sombre passages of a War Requiem. 

One of the bones in Ford's shoulder began to grate against another 
one of the bones in his shoulder in a way which suggested that the 
hand had learnt the principles of pain from a highly skilled 
chiropracter. Fie hoped he could get this business settled before the 
hand started to grate one of the bones in his shoulder against any of 
the bones in different parts of his body. Luckily, the shoulder it was 
holding was not the one he had his satchel slung over. 



The barman slid the card back across the bar at Ford. 

"We have never," he said with muted savagery, "heard of this 
thing." 

This was hardly surprising. 

Ford had only acquired it through a serious computer error 
towards the end of the fifteen years' sojourn he had spent on the 
planet Earth. Exactly how serious, the American Express Company had 
got to know very rapidly, and the increasingly strident and panic- 
stricken demands of its debt collection department were only 
silenced by the unexpected demolition of the entire planet by the 
Vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass. 

Fie had kept it ever since because he found it useful to carry a form 
of currency that no one would accept. 

"Credit?" he said. "Aaaargggh..." 

These two words were usually coupled together in the Old Pink 
Dog Bar. 

"I thought," gasped Ford, "that this was meant to be a class 
establishment..." 

Fie glanced around at the motley collection of thugs, pimps and 
record company executives that skulked on the edges of the dim 
pools of light with which the dark shadows of the bar's inner recesses 
were pitted. They were all very deliberately looking in any direction 
but his now, carefully picking up the threads of their former 
conversations about murders, drug rings and music publishing deals. 
They knew what would happen now and didn't want to watch in case 
it put them off their drinks. 

"You gonna die, boy," the barman murmured quietly at Ford 
Prefect, and the evidence was on his side. The bar used to have one of 
those signs hanging up which said, "Please don't ask for credit as a 
punch in the mouth often offends", but in the interest of strict 
accuracy this was altered to, "Please don't ask for credit because 
having your throat torn out by a savage bird while a disembodied 
hand smashes your head against the bar often offends". However, 
this made an unreadable mess of the notice, and anyway didn't have 
the same ring to it, so it was taken down again. It was felt that the 
story would get about of its own accord, and it had. 



"Lemme look at the bill again," said Ford. He picked it up and 
studied it thoughtfully under the malevolent gaze of the barman, and 
the equally malevolent gaze of the bird, which was currently gouging 
great furrows in the bar top with its talons. 

It was a rather lengthy piece of paper. 

At the bottom of it was a number which looked like one of those 
serial numbers you find on the underside of stereo sets which always 
takes so long to copy on to the registration form. He had, after all, 
been in the bar all day, he had been drinking a lot of stuff with 
bubbles in it, and he had bought an awful lot of rounds for all the 
pimps, thugs and record executives who suddenly couldn't remember 
who he was. 

He cleared his throat rather quietly and patted his pockets. There 
was, as he knew, nothing in them. He rested his left hand lightly but 
firmly on the half-opened flap of his satchel. The disembodied hand 
renewed its pressure on his right shoulder. 

"You see," said the barman, and his face seemed to wobble evilly in 
front of Ford's, "I have a reputation to think of. You see that, don't 
you?" 

This is it, thought Ford. There was nothing else for it. He had 
obeyed the rules, he had made a bona fide attempt to pay his bill, it 
had been rejected. He was now in danger of his life. 

"Well," he said quietly, "if it's your reputation..." 

With a sudden flash of speed he opened his satchel and slapped 
down on the bar top his copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 
and the official card which said that he was a field researcher for the 
Guide and absolutely not allowed to do what he was now doing. 

"Want a write-up?" 

The barman's face stopped in mid-wobble. The bird's talons 
stopped in mid-furrow. The hand slowly released its grip. 

"That," said the barman in a barely audible whisper, from between 
dry lips, "will do nicely, sir." 



Chapter 5 


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a powerful organ. Indeed, 
its influence is so prodigious that strict rules have had to be drawn up 
by its editorial staff to prevent its misuse. So none of its field 
researchers are allowed to accept any kind of services, discounts or 
preferential treatment of any kind in return for editorial favours 
unless: 

a) they have made a bona fide attempt to pay for a service in the 
normal way; 

b) their lives would be otherwise in danger; 

c) they really want to. 

Since invoking the third rule always involved giving the editor a cut. 
Ford always preferred to much about with the first two. 

He stepped out along the street, walking briskly. 

The air was stifling, but he liked it because it was stifling city air, full 
of excitingly unpleasant smells, dangerous music and the sound of 
warring police tribes. 

He carried his satchel with an easy swaying motion so that he could 
get a good swing at anybody who tried to take it from him without 
asking. It contained everything he owned, which at the moment 
wasn't much. 

A limousine careered down the street, dodging between the piles 
of burning garbage, and frightening an old pack animal which lurched, 
screeching, out of its way, stumbled against the window of a herbal 
remedies shop, set off a wailing alarm, blundered off down the street, 
and then pretended to fall down the steps of a small pasta restaurant 
where it knew it would get photographed and fed. 

Ford was walking north. He thought he was probably on his way to 
the spaceport, but he had thought that before. He knew he was going 
through that part of the city where people's plans often changed 
quite abruptly. 

"Do you want to have a good time?" said a voice from a doorway. 



"As far as I can tell," said Ford, "I'm having one. Thanks." 

"Are you rich?" said another. 

This made Ford laugh. 

Fie turned and opened his arms in a wide gesture. "Do I look rich?" 
he said. 

"Don't know," said the girl. "Maybe, maybe not. Maybe you'll get 
rich. I have a very special service for rich people..." 

"Oh yes?" said Ford, intrigued but careful. "And what's that?" 

"I tell them it's OK to be rich." 

Gunfire erupted from a window high above them, but it was only a 
bass player getting shot for playing the wrong riff three times in a row, 
and bass players are two a penny in Flan Dold City. 

Ford stopped and peered into the dark doorway. 

"You what?" he said. 

The girl laughed and stepped forward a little out of the shadow. 

She was tall, and had that kind of self-possessed shyness which is a 
great trick if you can do it. 

"It's my big number," she saed. "I have a Master's degree in Social 
Economics and can be very convincing. People love it. Especially in 
this city." 

"Goosnargh," said Ford Prefect, which was a special Betelgeusian 
word he used when he knew he should say something but didn't 
know what it should be. 

Fie sat on a step, took from his satchel a bottle of that 01' Janx 
Spirit and a towel. Fie opened the bottle and wiped the top of it with 
the towel, which had the opposite effect to the one intended, in that 
the 01' Janx Spirit instantly killed off millions of the germs which had 
been slowly building up quite a complex and enlightened civilization 
on the smellier patches of the towel. 

"Want some?" he said, after he'd had a swig himself. 

She shrugged and took the proffered bottle. 

They sat for a while, peacefully listening to the clamour of burglar 
alarms in the next block. 

"As it happens, I'm owed a lot of money," said Ford, "so if I ever get 
hold of it, can I come and see you then maybe?" 

"Sure, I'll be here," said the girl. "So how much is a lot?" 



"Fifteen years' back pay." 

"For?" 

"Writing two words." 

"Zarquon," said the girl. "Which one took the time?" 

"The first one. Once I'd got that the second one just came one 
afternoon after lunch." 

A huge electronic drum kit hurtled through the window high above 
them and smashed itself to bits in the street in front of them. 

It soon became apparent that some of the burglar alarms on the 
next block had been deliberately set off by one police tribe in order to 
lay an ambush for the other. Cars with screaming sirens converged on 
the area, only to find themselves being picked off by copters which 
came thudding through the air between the city's mountainous tower 
blocks. 

"In fact," said Ford, having to shout now above the din, "it wasn't 
quite like that. I wrote an awful lot, but they just cut it down." 

Fie took his copy of the Guide back out of his satchel. 

"Then the planet got demolished," he shouted. "Really worthwhile 
job, eh? They've still got to pay me, though." 

"You work for that thing?" the girl yelled back. 

"Yeah." 

"Good number." 

"You want to see the stuff I wrote?" he shouted. "Before it gets 
erased? The new revisions are due to be released tonight over the net. 
Someone must have found out that the planet I spent fifteen years on 
has been demolished by now. They missed it on the last few revisions, 
but it can't escape their notice for ever." 

"It's getting impossible to talk isn't it?" 

"What?" 

She shrugged and pointed upwards. 

There was a copter above them now which seemed to be involved 
in a side skirmish with the band upstairs. Smoke was billowing from 
the building. The sound engineer was hanging out of the window by 
his fingertips, and a maddened guitarist was beating on his fingers 
with a burning guitar. The helicopter was firing at all of them. 

"Can we move?" 



They wandered down the street, away from the noise. They ran 
into a street theatre group which tried to do a short play for them 
about the problems of the inner city, but then gave up and 
disappeared into the small restaurant most recently patronized by the 
pack animal. 

All the time, Ford was poking at the interface panel of the Guide. 
They ducked into an alleyway. Ford squatted on a garbage can while 
information began to flood over the screen of the Guide. 

Fie located his entry. 

"Earth: Mostly harmless." 

Almost immediately the screen became a mass of system messages. 

"Flere it comes," he said. 

"Please wait," said the messages. "Entries are being updated over 
the Sub-Etha Net. This entry is being revised. The system will be down 
for ten seconds." 

At the end of the alley a steel grey limousine crawled past. 

"Fley look," said the girl, "if you get paid, look me up. I'm a working 
girl, and there are people over there who need me. I gotta go." 

She brushed aside Ford's half-articulated protests, and left him 
sitting dejectedly on his garbage can preparing to watch a large 
swathe of his working life being swept away electronically into the 
ether. 

Out in the street things had calmed down a little. The police battle 
had moved off to other sectors of the city, the few surviving members 
of the rock band had agreed to recognize their musical differences 
and pursue solo careers, the street theatre group were re-emerging 
from the pasta restaurant with the pack animal, telling it they would 
take it to a bar they knew where it would be treated with a little 
respect, and a little way further on the steel grey limousine was 
parked silently by the kerbside. 

The girl hurried towards it. 

Behind her, in the darkness of the alley, a green flickering glow was 
bathing Ford Prefect's face, and his eyes were slowly widening in 
astonishment. 

For where he had expected to find nothing, an erased, closed-off 
entry, there was instead a continuous stream of data-text, diagrams, 
figures and images, moving descriptions of surf on Australian beaches, 



Yoghurt on Greek islands, restaurants to avoid in Los Angeles, 
currency deals to avoid in Istanbul, weather to avoid in London, bars 
to go everywhere. Pages and pages of it. It was all there, everything 
he had written. 

With a deepening frown of blank incomprehension he went 
backwards and forwards through it, stopping here and there at 
various entries. 

Tips for aliens in New York: 

Land anywhere, Central Park, anywhere. No one will care, or 
indeed even notice. 

Surviving: get a job as cab driver immediately. A cab driver's job is 
to drive people anywhere they want to go in big yellow machines 
called taxis. Don't worry if you don't know how the machine works 
and you can't speak the language, don't understand the geography or 
indeed the basic physics of the area, and have large green antennae 
growing out of your head. Believe me, this is the best way of staying 
inconspicuous. 

If your body is really weird try showing it to people in the streets 
for money. 

Amphibious life forms from any of the worlds in the Swulling, 
Noxios or Nausalia systems will particularly enjoy the East River, 
which is said to be richer in those lovely life-giving nutrients then the 
finest and most virulent laboratory slime yet achieved. 

Having fun: This is the big section. It is impossible to have more fun 
without electrocuting your pleasure centres... 

Ford flipped the switch which he saw was now marked "Mode 
Execute Ready" instead of the now old-fashioned "Access Standby" 
which had so long ago replaced the appallingly stone-aged "Off". 

This was a planet he had seen completely destroyed, seen with his 
own two eyes or rather, blinded as he had been by the hellish 
disruption of air and light, felt with his own two feet as the ground 
had started to pound at him like a hammer, bucking, roaring, gripped 
by tidal waves of energy pouring out of the loathsome yellow Vogon 
ships. And then at last, five seconds after the moment he had 
determined as being the last possible moment had already passed, 



the gently swinging nausea of dematerialization as he and Arthur 
Dent had been beamed up through the atmosphere like a sports 
broadcast. 

There was no mistake, there couldn't have been. The Earth had 
definitely been destroyed. Definitely, definitely. Boiled away into 
space. 

And yet here - he activated the Guide again - was his own entry on 
how you would set about having a good time in Bournemouth, Dorset, 
England, which he had always prided himself on as being one of the 
most baroque pieces of invention he had ever delivered. He read it 
again and shook his head in sheer wonder. 

Suddenly he realized what the answer to the problem was, and it 
was this, that something very weird was happening; and if something 
very weird was happening, he thought, he wanted it to be happening 
to him. 

He stashed the Guide back in his satchel and hurried out on to the 
street again. 

Walking north he again passed a steel grey limousine parked by the 
kerbside, and from a nearby doorway he heard a soft voice saying, 

"It's OK, honey, it's really OK, you got to learn to feel good about it. 
Look at the way the whole economy is structured ..." 

Ford grinned, detoured round the next block which was now in 
flames, found a police helicopter which was standing unattended in 
the street, broke into it, strapped himself in, crossed his fingers and 
sent it hurtling inexpertly into the sky. 

He weaved terrifyingly up through the canyoned walls of the city, 
and once clear of them, hurtled through the black and red pall of 
smoke which hung permanently above it. 

Ten minutes later, with all the copter's sirens blaring and its rapid- 
fire cannon blasting at random into the clouds, Ford Prefect brought it 
careering down among the gantries and landing lights at Han Dold 
spaceport, where it settled like a gigantic, startled and very noisy gnat. 

Since he hadn't damaged it too much he was able to trade it in for 
a first class ticket on the next ship leaving the system, and settled into 
one of its huge, voluptuous body-hugging seats. 



This was going to be fun, he thought to himself, as the ship blinked 
silently across the insane distances of deep space and the cabin 
service got into its full extravagant swing. 

"Yes please," he said to the cabin attendants whenever they glided 
up to offer him anything at all. 

He smiled with a curious kind of manic joy as he flipped again 
through the mysteriously re-instated entry on the planet Earth. He 
had a major piece of unfinished business that he would now be able 
to attend to, and was terribly pleased that life had suddenly furnished 
him with a serious goal to achieve. 

It suddenly occurred to him to wonder where Arthur Dent was, and 
if he knew. 

Arthur Dent was one thousand, four hundred and thirty-seven light 
years away in a Saab, and anxious. 

Behind him in the backseat was a girl who had made him crack his 
head on the door as he climbed in. He didn't know if it was just 
because she was the first female of his own species that he had laid 
eyes on in years, or what it was, but he felt stupefied with, with... This 
is absurd, he told himself. Calm down, he told himself. You are not, he 
continued to himself in the firmest internal voice he could muster, in 
a fit and rational state. You have just hitch-hiked over a hundred 
thousand light years across the galaxy, you are very tired, a little 
confused and extremely vulnerable. Relax, don't panic, concentrate 
on breathing deeply. 

He twisted round in his seat. 

"Are you sure she's all right?" he said again. 

Beyond the fact that she was, to him, heartthumpingly beautiful, 
he could make out very little, how tall she was, how old she was, the 
exact shading of her hair. And nor could he ask her anything about 
herself because, sadly, she was completely unconscious. 

"She's just drugged," said her brother, shrugging, not moving his 
eyes from the road ahead. 

"And that's all right, is it?" said Arthur, in alarm. 

"Suits me," he said. 

"Ah," said Arthur. "Er," he added after a moment's thought. 

The conversation so far had been going astoundingly badly. 



After an initial flurry of opening hellos, he and Russell - the 
wonderful girl's brother's name was Russell, a name which, to 
Arthur's mind, always suggested burly men with blond moustaches 
and blow-dried hair, who would at the slightest provocation start 
wearing velvet tuxedos and frilly shirtfronts and would then have to 
be forcibly restrained from commentating on snooker matches - had 
quickly discovered they didn't like each other at all. 

Russell was a burly man. He had a blond moustache. His hair was 
fine and blow dried. To be fair to him - though Arthur didn't see any 
necessity for this beyond the sheer mental exercise of it - he, Arthur, 
was looking pretty grim himself. A man can't cross a hundred 
thousand light years, mostly in other people's baggage compartments, 
without beginning to fray a little, and Arthur had frayed a lot. 

"She's not a junkie," said Russell suddenly, as if he clearly thought 
that someone else in the car might be. "She's under sedation." 

"But that's terrible," said Arthur, twisting round to look at her again. 
She seemed to stir slightly and her head slipped sideways on her 
shoulder. Her dark hair fell across her face, obscuring it. 

"What's the matter with her, is she ill?" 

"No," said Russell, "merely barking mad." 

"What?" said Arthur, horrified. 

"Loopy, completely bananas. I'm taking her back to the hospital 
and telling them to have another go. They let her out while she still 
thought she was a hedgehog." 

"A hedgehog?" 

Russell hooted his horn fiercely at the car that came round the 
corner towards them half-way on to their side of the road, making 
them swerve. The anger seemed to make him feel better. 

"Well, maybe not a hedgehog," he said after he'd settled down 
again. "Though it would probably be simpler to deal with if she did. If 
somebody thinks they're a hedgehog, presumably you just give 'em a 
mirror and a few pictures of hedgehogs and tell them to sort it out for 
themselves, come down again when they feel better. At least medical 
science could deal with it, that's the point. Seems that's no good 
enough for Fenny, though." 

"Fenny...?" 

"You know what I got her for Christmas?" 



"Well, no." 

"Black's Medical Dictionary." 

"Nice present." 

"I thought so. Thousands of diseases in it, all in alphabetical order." 

"You say her name is Fenny?" 

"Yeah. Take your pick, I said. Anything in here can be dealt with. 
The proper drugs can be prescribed. But no, she has to have 
something different. Just to make life difficult. She was like that at 
school, you know." 

"Was she?" 

"She was. Fell over playing hockey and broke a bone nobody had 
ever heard of." 

"I can see how that would be irritating," said Arthur doubtfully. Fie 
was rather disappointed to discover her name was Fenny. It was a 
rather silly, dispiriting name, such as an unlovely maiden aunt might 
vote herself if she couldn't sustain the name Fenella properly. 

"Not that I wasn't sympathetic," continued Russell, "but it did get a 
bit irritating. She was limping for months." 

Fie slowed down. 

"This is your turning isn't it?" 

"Ah, no," said Arthur, "five miles further on. If that's all right." 

"OK," said Russell after a very tiny pause to indicate that it wasn't, 
and speeded up again. 

It was in fact Arthur's turning, but he couldn't leave without finding 
out something more about this girl who seemed to have taken such a 
grip on his mind without even waking up. Fie could take either of the 
next two turnings. 

They led back to the village that had been his home, though what 
he would find there he hesitated to imagine. Familiar landmarks had 
been flitting by, ghostlike, in the dark, giving rise to the shudders that 
only very normal things can create, when seen where the mind is 
unprepared for them, and in an unfamiliar light. 

By his own personal time scale, so far as he could estimate it, living 
as he had been under the alien rotations of distant suns, it was eight 
years since he had left, but what time had passed here he could 
hardly guess. Indeed, what events had passed were beyond his 



exhausted comprehension because this planet, his home, should not 
be here. 

Eight years ago, at lunchtime, this planet had been demolished, 
utterly destroyed, by the huge yellow Vogon ships which had hung in 
the lunchtime sky as if the law of gravity was no more than a local 
regulation, and breaking it no more than a parking offence. 

"Delusions," said Russell. 

"What?" said Arthur, started out of his train of thought. 

"She says she suffers from strange delusions that she's living in the 
real world. It's no good telling her that she is living in the real world 
because she just says that's why the delusions are so strange. Don't 
know about you, but I find that kind of conversation pretty exhausting. 
Give her the tablets and piss off for a beer is my answer. I mean you 
can only muck about so much can't you?" 

Arthur frowned, not for the first time. 

"Well..." 

"And all this dreams and nightmare stuff. And the doctors going on 
about strange jumps in her brainwave patterns." 

"Jumps?" 

"This," said Fenny. 

Arthur whirled round in his seat and stared into her suddenly open 
but utterly vacant eyes. Whatever she was looking at wasn't in the car. 
Her eyes fluttered, her head jerked once, and then she was sleeping 
peacefully. 

"What did she say?" he asked anxiously. 

"She said 'this'." 

"This what?" 

"This what? How the heck should I know? This hedgehog, that 
chimney pot, the other pair of Don Alfonso's tweezers. She's barking 
mad, I thought I'd mentioned that." 

"You don't seem to care very much." Arthur tried to say it as 
matter-of-factly as possible but it didn't seem to work. 

"Look, buster..." 

"OK, I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean it to sound 
like that," said Arthur. "I know you care a lot, obviously," he added, 
lying. "I know that you have to deal with it somehow. You'll have to 



excuse me. I just hitched from the other side of the Horsehead 
Nebula." 

He stared furiously out of the window. 

He was astonished that of all the sensations fighting for room in his 
head on this night as he returned to the home that he had thought 
had vanished into oblivion for ever, the one that was compelling him 
was an obsession with this bizarre girl of whom he knew nothing 
other than that she had said "this" to him, and that he wouldn't wish 
her brother on a Vogon. 

"So, er, what were the jumps, these jumps you mentioned?" he 
went on to say as quickly as he could. 

"Look, this is my sister, I don't even know why I'm talking to you 
about..." 

"OK, I'm sorry. Perhaps you'd better let me out. This is..." 

At the moment he said it, it became impossible, because the storm 
which had passed them by suddenly erupted again. Lightning belted 
through the sky, and someone seemed to be pouring something 
which closely resembled the Atlantic Ocean over them through a 
sieve. 

Russell swore and steered intently for a few seconds as the sky 
blattered at them. He worked out his anger by rashly accelerating to 
pass a lorry marked "McKeena's All-Weather Haulage". The tension 
eased as the rain subsided. 

"It started with all that business of the CIA agent they found in the 
reservoir, when everybody had all the hallucinations and everything, 
you remember?" 

Arthur wondered for a moment whether to mention again that he 
had just hitch-hiked back from the other side of the Horsehead 
Nebula and was for this and various other related and astounding 
reasons a little out of touch with recent events, but he decided it 
would only confuse matters further. 

"No," he said. 

"That was the moment she cracked up. She was in a cafe 
somewhere. Rickmansworth. Don't know what she was doing there, 
but that was where she cracked up. Apparently she stood up, calmly 
announced that she had undergone some extraordinary revelation or 



something, wobbled a bit, looked confused, and finally collapsed 
screaming into an egg sandwich." 

Arthur winced. "I'm very sorry to hear that," he said a little stiffly. 

Russell made a sort of grumping noise. 

"So what," said Arthur in an attempt to piece things together, "was 
the CIA agent doing in the reservoir?" 

"Bobbing up and down of course. He was dead." 

"But what..." 

"Come on, you remember all that stuff. The hallucinations. 

Everyone said it was a cock up, the CIA trying experiments into drug 
warfare or something. Some crackpot theory that instead of invading 
a country it would be much cheaper and more effective to make 
everyone think they'd been invaded." 

"What hallucinations were those exactly...?" said Arthur in a rather 
quiet voice. 

"What do you mean, what hallucinations? I'm talking about all that 
stuff with the big yellow ships, everyone going crazy and saying we're 
going to die, and then pop, they vanished as the effect wore off. The 
CIA denied it which meant it must be true." 

Arthur's head went a little swimmy. His hand grabbed at something 
to steady himself, and gripped it tightly. His mouth made little 
opening and closing movements as if it was on his mind to say 
something, but nothing emerged. 

"Anyway," continued Russell, "whatever drug it was it didn't seem 
to wear off so fast with Fenny. I was all for suing the CIA, but a lawyer 
friend of mine said it would be like trying to attack a lunatic asylum 
with a banana, so..." He shrugged. 

"The Vogon..." squeaked Arthur. "The yellow ships... vanished?" 

"Well, of course they did, they were hallucinations," said Russell, 
and looked at Arthur oddly. "You trying to say you don't remember 
any of this? Where have you been for heaven's sake?" 

This was, to Arthur, such an astonishingly good question that he 
half-leapt out of his seat with shock. 

"Christ!!!" yelled Russell, fighting to control the car which was 
suddenly trying to skid. He pulled it out of the path of an oncoming 
lorry and swerved up on to a grass bank. As the car lurched to a halt. 



the girl in the back was thrown against Russell's seat and collapsed 
awkwardly. 

Arthur twisted round in horror. 

"Is she all right?" he blurted out. 

Russell swept his hands angrily back through his blow-dried hair. 
He tugged at his blond moustache. He turned to Arthur. 

"Would you please," he said, "let go of the handbrake?" 



Chapter 6 


From here it was a four-mile walk to his village: a further mile to 
the turning, to which the abominable Russell had now fiercely 
declined to take him, and from there a further three miles of winding 
country lane. 

The Saab seethed off into the night. Arthur watched it go, as 
stunned as a man might be who, having believed himself to be totally 
blind for five years, suddenly discovers that he had merely been 
wearing too large a hat. 

He shook his head sharply in the hope that it might dislodge some 
salient fact which would fall into place and make sense of an 
otherwise utterly bewildering Universe, but since the salient fact, if 
there was one, entirely failed to do this, he set off up the road again, 
hoping that a good vigorous walk, and maybe even some good painful 
blisters, would help to reassure him of his own existence at least, if 
not his sanity. 

It was 10.30 when he arrived, a fact he discovered from the 
steamed and greasy window of the Horse and Groom pub, in which 
there had hung for many years a battered old Guiness clock which 
featured a picture of an emu with a pint glass jammed rather 
amusingly down its throat. 

This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime 
during which first his house and then the entire planet Earth had been 
demolished, or rather had seemed to be demolished. No, damn it, 
had been demolished, because if it hadn't then where the bloody 
heck had he been for the last eight years, and how he had got there if 
not in one of the big yellow Vogon ships which the appalling Russell 
had just been telling him were merely drug-induced hallucinations, 
and yet if it had been demolished, what was he currently standing 
on...? 



He jammed the brake on this line of thought because it wasn't 
going to get him any further than it had the last twenty times he'd 
been over it. 

He started again. 

This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime 
during which whatever it was had happened that he was going to sort 
out later had happened, and... 

It still didn't make sense. 

He started again. 

This was the pub in which... 

This was a pub. 

Pubs served drinks and he couldn't half do with one. 

Satisfied that his jumbled thought processes had at last arrived at a 
conclusion, and a conclusion he was happy with, even if it wasn't the 
one he had set out to achieve, he strode towards the door. 

And stopped. 

A small black wire-haired terrier ran out from behind a low wall 
and then, catching sight of Arthur, began to snarl. 

Now Arthur knew this dog, and he knew it well. It belonged to an 
advertising friend of his, and was called Know-Nothing-Bozo because 
the way its hair stood up on its head it reminded people of the 
President of the United States, and the dog knew Arthur, or at least 
should do. It was a stupid dog, could not even read an autocue, which 
way why some people had protested about its name, but it should at 
least have been able to recognize Arthur instead of standing there, 
hackles raised, as if Arthur was the most fearful apparition ever to 
intrude upon its feeble-witted life. 

This prompted Arthur to go and peer at the window again, this 
time with an eye not for the asphyxiating emu but for himself. 

Seeing himself for the first time suddenly in a familiar context, he 
had to admit that the dog had a point. 

He looked a lot like something a farmer would use to scare birds 
with, and there was no doubt but that to go into the pub in his 
present condition would excite comments of a raucous kind, and 
worse still, there would doubtless be several people in there at the 
moment whom he knew, all of whom would be bound to bombard 



him with questions which, at the moment, he felt ill-equipped to deal 
with. 

Will Smithers, for instance, the owner of Know-Nothing-Bozo the 
Non-Wonder Dog, an animal so stupid that it had been sacked from 
one of Will's own commercials for being incapable of knowing which 
dog food it was supposed to prefer, despite the fact that the meat in 
all the other bowls had had engine oil poured over it. 

Will would definitely be in there. Here was his dog, here was his car, 
a grey Porsche 928S with a sign in the back window which read, "My 
other car is also a Porsche." Damn him. 

He stared at it and realized that he had just learned something he 
hadn't known before. 

Will Smithers, like most of the overpaid and under-scrupulous 
bastards Arthur knew in advertising made a point of changing his car 
every August so that he could tell people his accountant made him do 
it, though the truth was that his accountant was trying like hell to stop 
him, what with all the alimony he had to pay, and so on - and this was 
the same car Arthur remembered him having before. The number 
plate proclaimed its year. 

Given that it was now winter, and that the event which had caused 
Arthur so much trouble eight of his personal years ago had occurred 
at the beginning of September, less than six or seven months could 
have passed here. 

He stood terribly still for a moment and let Know-Nothing-Bozo 
jump up and down yapping at him. He was suddenly stunned by a 
realization he could no longer avoid, which was this: he was now an 
alien on his own world. Try as he might, no one was even to be able 
to believe his story. Not only did it sound perfectly potty, but it was 
flatly contradicted by the simplest observable facts. 

Was this really the Earth? Was there the slightest possibility that he 
had made some extraordinary mistake? 

The pub in front of him was unbearably familiar to him in every 
detail - every brick, every piece of peeling paint; and inside he could 
sense its familiar stuffy, noisy warmth, its exposed beams, its 
unauthentic cast-iron light fittings, its bar sticky with beer that people 
he knew had put their elbows in, overlooked by cardboard cutouts of 
girls with packets of peanuts stapled all over their breasts. It was all 
the stuff of his home, his world. 



He even knew this blasted dog. 

"Hey, Know-Nothing!" 

The sound of Will Smithers' voice meant he had to decide what do 
to quickly. If he stood his ground he would be discovered and the 
whole circus would begin. To hide would only postpone the moment, 
and it was bitterly cold now. 

The fact that it was Will made the choice easier. It wasn't that 
Arthur disliked him as such-Will was quite fun. It was just that he was 
fun in such an exhausting way because, being in advertising, he 
always wanted you to know how much fun he was having and where 
he had got his jacket from. 

Mindful of this, Arthur hid behind a van. 

"Hey, Know-Nothing, what's up?" 

The door opened and Will came out, wearing a leather flying jacket 
that he'd got a mate of his at the Road Research Laboratory to crash a 
car into specially, in order to get that battered look. Know-Nothing 
yelped with delight and, having got the attention it wanted, was 
happy to forget Arthur. 

Will was with some friends, and they had a game they played with 
the dog. 

"Commies!" they all shouted at the dog in chorus. "Commies, 
commies, commies!!!" 

The dog went berserk with barking, prancing up and down, yapping 
its little heart out, beside itself in transports of ecstatic rage. They all 
laughed and cheered it on, then gradually dispersed to their various 
cars and disappeared into the night. 

Well that clears one thing up, thought Arthur from behind the van, 
this is quite definitely the planet I remember. 



Chapter 7 


His house was still there. 

How or why, he had no idea. He had decided to go and have a look 
while he was waiting for the pub to empty, so that he could go and 
ask the landlord for a bed for the night when everyone else had gone. 
And there it was. 

He hurriedly let himself in with the key he kept under a stone frog 
in the garden, because, astoundingly, the phone was ringing. 

He had heard it faintly all the way up the lane and had started to 
run as soon as he realized where the sound was coming from. 

The door had to be forced open because of the astonishing 
accumulation of junk mail on the doormat. It jammed itself stuck on 
what he would later discover were fourteen identical, personally 
addressed invitations to apply for a credit card he already had, 
seventeen identical threatening letters for non-payment of bills on a 
credit card he didn't have, thirty-three identical letters saying that he 
personally had been specially selected as a man of taste and 
discrimination who knew what he wanted and where he was going in 
today's sophisticated jet-setting world and would he therefore like to 
buy some grotty wallet, and also a dead tabby kitten. 

He rammed himself through the relatively narrow opening afforded 
by all this, stumbled through a pile of wine offers that no 
discriminating connoisseur would want to miss, slithered over a heap 
of beach villa holidays, blundered up the dark stairs to his bedroom 
and got to the phone just as it stopped ringing. 

He collapsed, panting, on to his cold, musty-smelling bed and for a 
few minutes stopped trying to prevent the world from spinning round 
his head in the way it obviously wanted to. 

When it had enjoyed its little spin and had calmed down a bit, 
Arthur reached out for the bedside light, not expecting it to come on. 
To his surprise it did. This appealed to Arthur's sense of logic. Since 
the Electricity Board cut him off without fail every time he paid his bill. 



it seemed only reasonable that they should leave him connected 
when he didn't. Sending them money obviously only drew attention 
to yourself. 

The room was much as he had left it, i.e. festeringly untidy, though 
the effect was muted a little by a thick layer of dust. Half-read books 
and magazines nestled amongst piles of half-used towels. Half pairs of 
socks reclined in half-drunk cups of coffee. What was once a half- 
eaten sandwich had now half-turned into something that Arthur 
entirely didn't want to know about. Bung a fork of lightning through 
this lot, he thought to himself, and you'd start the evolution of life all 
over again. 

There was only one thing in the room that was different. 

For a moment or so he couldn't see what the one thing that was 
different was, because it too was covered in a film of disgusting dust. 
Then his eyes caught it and stopped. 

It was next to a battered old television on which it was only 
possible to watch Open University Study Courses, because if it tried to 
show anything more exciting it would break down. 

It was a box. 

Arthur pushed himself up on his elbows and peered at it. 

It was a grey box, with a kind of dull lustre to it. It was a cubic grey 
box, just over a foot on a side. It was tied with a single grey ribbon, 
knotted into a neat bow on the top. 

He got up, walked over and touched it in surprise. Whatever it was 
clearly gift-wrapped, neatly and beautifully, and was waiting for him 
to open it. 

Cautiously, he picked it up and carried it back to the bed. He 
brushed the dust off the top and loosened the ribbon. The top of the 
box was a lid, with a flap tucked into the body of the box. 

He untucked it and looked into the box. In it was a glass globe, 
nestling in fine grey tissue paper. He drew it out, carefully. It wasn't a 
proper globe because it was open at the bottom, or, as Arthur 
realized turning it over, at the top, with a thick rim. It was a bowl. A 
fish bowl. 

It was made of the most wonderful glass perfectly transparent, yet 
with an extraordinary silver-grey quality as if crystal and slate had 
gone into its making. 



Arthur slowly turned it over and over in his hands. It was one of the 
most beautiful objects he had ever seen, but he was entirely 
perplexed by it. He looked into the box, but other than the tissue 
paper there was nothing. On the outside of the box there was nothing. 

He turned the bowl round again. It was wonderful. It was exquisite. 
But it was a fish bowl. 

He tapped it with his thumbnail and it rang with a deep and 
glorious chime which was sustained for longer than seemed possible, 
and when at last it faded seemed not to die away but to drift off into 
other worlds, as into a deep sea dream. 

Entranced, Arthur turned it round yet again, and this time the light 
from the dusty little bedside lamp caught it at a different angle and 
glittered on some fine abrasions on the fish bowl's surface. He held it 
up, adjusting the angle to the light, and suddenly saw clearly the 
finely engraved shapes of words shadowed on the glass. 

"So Long," they said, "and Thanks..." 

And that was all. He blinked, and understood nothing. 

For fully five more minutes he turned the object round and around, 
held it to the light at different angles, tapped it for its mesmerizing 
chime and pondered on the meaning of the shadowy letters but could 
find none. Finally he stood up, filled the bowl with water from the tap 
and put it back on the table next to the television. He shook the little 
Babel fish from his ear and dropped it, wriggling, into the bowl. He 
wouldn't be needing it any more, except for watching foreign movies. 

He returned to lie on his bed, and turned out the light. 

He lay still and quiet. He absorbed the enveloping darkness, slowly 
relaxed his limbs from end to end, eased and regulated his breathing, 
gradually cleared his mind of all thought, closed his eyes and was 
completely incapable of getting to sleep. 

The night was uneasy with rain. The rain clouds themselves had 
now moved on and were currently concentrating their attention on a 
small transport cafe just outside Bournemouth, but the sky through 
which they had passed had been disturbed by them and now wore a 
damply ruffled air, as if it didn't know what else it might not do it 
further provoked. 



The moon was out in a watery way. It looked like a ball of paper 
from the back pocket of jeans that have just come out of the washing 
machine, and which only time and ironing would tell if it was an old 
shopping list or a five pound note. 

The wind flicked about a little, like the tail of a horse that's trying to 
decide what sort of mood it's in tonight, and a bell somewhere 
chimed midnight. 

A skylight creaked open. 

It was stiff and had to be jiggled and persuaded a little because the 
frame was slightly rotten and the hinges had at some time in its life 
been rather sensibly painted over, but eventually it was open. 

A strut was found to prop it and a figure struggled out into the 
narrow gully between the opposing pitches of the roof. 

It stood and watched the sky in silence. 

The figure was completely unrecognizable as the wild-looking 
creature who had burst crazily into the cottage a little over an hour 
ago. Gone was the ragged threadbare dressing gown, smeared with 
the mud of a hundred worlds, stained with junk food condiment from 
a hundred grimy spaceports, gone was the tangled mane of hair, gone 
the long and knotted beard, flourishing ecosystem and all. 

Instead, there was Arthur Dent the smooth and casual, in 
corduroys and a chunky sweater. His hair was cropped and washed, 
his chin clean shaven. Only the eyes still said that whatever it was the 
Universe thought it was doing to him, he would still like it please to 
stop. 

They were not the same eyes with which he had last looked out at 
this particular scene, and the brain which interpreted the images the 
eyes resolved was not the same brain. There had been no surgery 
involved, just the continual wrenching of experience. 

The night seemed like an alive thing to him at this moment, the 
dark earth around him a being in which he was rooted. 

He could feel like a tingle on distant nerve ends the flood of a far 
river, the roll of invisible hills, the knot of heavy rainclouds parked 
somewhere away to the south. 

He could sense, too, the thrill of being a tree, which was something 
he hadn't expected. He knew that it felt good to curl your toes in the 
earth, but he'd never realized it could feel quite as good as that. He 



could sense an almost unseemly wave of pleasure reaching out to him 
all the way from the New Forest. He must try this summer, he thought, 
and see what having leaves felt like. 

From another direction he felt the sensation of being a sheep 
startled by a flying saucer, but it was virtually indistinguishable from 
the feeling of being a sheep startled by anything else it ever 
encountered, for they were creatures who learned very little on their 
journey through life, and would be startled to see the sun rising in the 
morning, and astonished by all the green stuff in the fields. 

He was surprised to find he could feel the sheep being startled by 
the sun that morning, and the morning before, and being startled by a 
clump of trees the day before that. He could go further and further 
back, but it got dull because all it consisted of was sheep being 
startled by things they'd been startled by the day before. 

He left the sheep and let his mind drift outwards sleepily in 
developing ripples. It felt the presence of other minds, hundreds of 
them, thousands in a web, some sleepy, some sleeping, some terribly 
excited, one fractured. 

One fractured. 

He passed it fleetingly and tried to feel for it again, but it eluded 
him like the other card with an apple on it in Pelmanism. He felt a 
spasm of excitement because he knew instinctively who it was, or at 
least knew who it was he wanted it to be, and once you know what it 
is you want to be true, instinct is a very useful device for enabling you 
to know that it is. 

He instinctively knew that it was Fenny and that he wanted to find 
her; but he could not. By straining too much for it, he could feel he 
was losing this strange new faculty, so he relaxed the search and let 
his mind wander more easily once more. 

And again, he felt the fracture. 

Again he couldn't find it. This time, whatever his instinct was busy 
telling him it was all right to believe, he wasn't certain that it was 
Fenny - or perhaps it was a different fracture this time. It had the 
same disjointed quality but it seemed a more general feeling of 
fracture, deeper, not a single mind, maybe not a mind at all. It was 
different. 



He let his mind sink slowly and widely into the Earth, rippling, 
seeping, sinking. 

He was following the Earth through its days, drifting with the 
rhythms of its myriad pulses, seeping through the webs of its life, 
swelling with its tides, turning with its weight. Always the fracture 
kept returning, a dull disjointed distant ache. 

And now he was flying through a land of light; the light was time, 
the tides of it were days receding. The fracture he had sensed, the 
second fracture, lay in the distance before him across the land, the 
thickness of a single hair across the dreaming landscape of the days of 
Earth. 

And suddenly he was upon it. 

He danced dizzily over the edge as the dreamland dropped sheer 
away beneath him, a stupefying precipice into nothing, him wildly 
twisting, clawing at nothing, flailing in horrifying space, spinning, 
falling. 

Across the jagged chasm had been another land, another time, an 
older world, not fractured from, but hardly joined: two Earths. He 
woke. 

A cold breeze brushed the feverish sweat standing on his forehead. 
The nightmare was spent and so, he felt, was he. His shoulders 
dropped, he gently rubbed his eyes with the tips of his fingers. At last 
he was sleepy as well as very tired. As to what it meant, if it meant 
anything at all, he would think about it in the morning; for now he 
would go to bed and sleep. His own bed, his own sleep. 

He could see his house in the distance and wondered why this was. 

It was silhouetted against the moonlight and he recognized its rather 
dull blockish shape. He looked about him and noticed that he was 
about eighteen inches above the rose bushes of one of his neighbours, 
John Ainsworth. His rose bushes were carefully tended, pruned back 
for the winter, strapped to canes and labelled, and Arthur wondered 
what he was doing above them. He wondered what was holding him 
there, and when he discovered that nothing was holding him there he 
crashed awkwardly to the ground. 

He picked himself up, brushed himself down and hobbled back to 
his house on a sprained ankle. He undressed and toppled into bed. 



While he was asleep the phone rang again. It rang for fully fifteen 
minutes and caused him to turn over twice. It never, however, stood 
a chance of waking him up. 

Chapter 8 


Arthur awoke feeling wonderful, absolutely fabulous, refreshed, 
overjoyed to be home, bouncing with energy, hardly disappointed at 
all to discover it was the middle of February. 

He almost danced to the fridge, found the three least hairy things 
in it, put them on a plate and watched them intently for two minutes. 
Since they made no attempt to move within that time he called them 
breakfast and ate them. Between them they killed a virulent space 
disease he's picked up without knowing it in the Flargathon Gas 
Swamps a few days earlier, which otherwise would have killed off half 
the population of the Western Hemisphere, blinded the other half 
and driven everyone else psychotic and sterile, so the Earth was lucky 
there. 

He felt strong, he felt healthy. He vigorously cleared away the junk 
mail with a spade and then buried the cat. 

Just as he was finishing that, the phone went, but he let it ring 
while he maintained a moment's respectful silence. Whoever it was 
would ring back if it was important. 

He kicked the mud off his shoes and went back inside. 

There had been a small number of significant letters in the piles of 
junk - some documents from the council, dated three years earlier, 
relating to the proposed demolition of his house, and some other 
letters about the setting up of a public inquiry into the whole bypass 
scheme in the area; there was also an old letter from Greenpeace, the 
ecological pressure group to which he occasionally made 
contributions, asking for help with their scheme to release dolphins 
and orcas from captivity, and some postcards from friends, vaguely 
complaining that he never got in touch these days. 



He collected these together and put them in a cardboard file which 
he marked "Things To Do". Since he was feeling so vigorous and 
dynamic that morning, he even added the word "Urgent!" 

He unpacked his towel and another few odd bits and pieces from 
the plastic bag he had acquired at the Port Brasta Mega-Market. The 
slogan on the side was a clever and elaborate pun in Lingua Centauri 
which was completely incomprehensible in any other language and 
therefore entirely pointless for a Duty Free Shop at a spaceport. The 
bag also had a hole in it so he threw it away. 

He realized with a sudden twinge that something else must have 
dropped out in the small spacecraft that had brought him to Earth, 
kindly going out of its way to drop him right beside the A303. He had 
lost his battered and spaceworn copy of the thing which had helped 
him find his way across the unbelievable wastes of space he had 
traversed. He had lost the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 

Well, he told himself, this time I really won't be needing it again. 

He had some calls to make. 

He had decided how to deal with the mass of contradictions his 
return journey precipitated, which was that he would simply brazen it 
out. 

He phoned the BBC and asked to be put through to his department 
head. 

"Oh, hello, Arthur Dent here. Look, sorry I haven't been in for six 
months but I've gone mad." 

"Oh, not to worry. Thought it was probably something like that. 
Happens here all the time. How soon can we expect you?" 

"When do hedgehogs stop hibernating?" 

"Sometime in spring I think." 

"I'll be in shortly after that." 

"Rightyho." 

He flipped through the Yellow Pages and made a short list of 
numbers to try. 

"Oh hello, is that the Old Elms Hospital? Yes, I was just phoning to 
see if I could have a word with Fenella, er... Fenella - Good Lord, silly 
me, I'll forget my own name next, er, Fenella - isn't this ridiculous? 
Patient of yours, dark haired girl, came in last night..." 



"I'm afraid we don't have any patients called Fenella." 

"Oh, don't you? I mean Fiona of course, we just call her Fen..." 

"I'm sorry, goodbye." 

Click. 

Six conversations along these lines began to take their toll on his 
mood of vigorous, dynamic optimism, and he decided that before it 
deserted him entirely he would take it down to the pub and parade it 
a little. 

Fie had had the perfect idea for explaining away every inexplicable 
weirdness about himself at a stroke, and he whistled to himself as he 
pushed open the door which had so daunted him last night. 

"Arthur!!!!" 

Fie grinned cheerfully at the boggling eyes that stared at him from 
all corners of the pub, and told them all what a wonderful time he'd 
had in Southern California. 



Chapter 9 


He accepted another pint and took a pull at it. 

"Of course, I had my own personal alchemist too." 

"You what?" 

He was getting silly and he knew it. Exuberance and Hall and 
Woodhouse best bitter was a mixture to be wary of, but one of the 
first effects it had is to stop you being wary of things, and the point at 
which Arthur should have stopped and explained no more was the 
point at which he started instead to get inventive. 

"Oh yes," he insisted with a happy glazed smile. "It's why I've lost 
so much weight." 

"What?" said his audience. 

"Oh yes," he said again. "The Californians have rediscovered 
alchemy. Oh yes." 

He smiled again. 

"Only," he said, "it's in a much more useful form than that which 
in..." He paused thoughtfully to let a little grammar assemble in his 
head. "In which the ancients used to practise it. Or at least," he added, 
"failed to practise it. They couldn't get it to work you know. 
Nostradamus and that lot. Couldn't cut it." 

"Nostradamus?" said one of his audience. 

"I didn't think he was an alchemist," said another. 

"I thought," said a third, "he was a seer." 

"He became a seer," said Arthur to his audience, the component 
parts of which were beginning to bob and blur a little, "because he 
was such a lousy alchemist. You should know that." 

He took another pull at his beer. It was something he had not 
tasted for eight years. He tasted it and tasted it. 

"What has alchemy got to do," asked a bit of the audience, "with 
losing weight?" 



"I'm glad you asked that," said Arthur. "Very glad. And I will now 
tell you what the connection is between..." He paused. "Between 
those two things. The things you mentioned. I'll tell you." 

He paused and manoeuvred his thoughts. It was like watching oil 
tankers doing three-point turns in the English Channel. 

"They've discovered how to turn excess body fat into gold," he said, 
in a sudden blur of coherence. 

"You’re kidding." 

"Oh yes," he said, "no," he corrected himself, "they have." 

He rounded on the doubting part of his audience, which was all of 
it, and so it took a little while to round on it completely. 

"Have you been to California?" he demanded. "Do you know the 
sort of stuff they do there?" 

Three members of his audience said they had and that he was 
talking nonsense. 

"You haven't seen anything," insisted Arthur. "Oh yes," he added, 
because someone was offering to buy another round. 

"The evidence," he said, pointing at himself, and not missing by 
more than a couple of inches, "is before your eyes. Fourteen hours in 
a trance," he said, "in a tank. In a trance. I was in a tank. I think," he 
added after a thoughtful pause, "I already said that." 

He waited patiently while the next round was duly distributed. He 
composed the next bit of his story in his mind, which was going to be 
something about the tank needing to be orientated along a line 
dropped perpendicularly from the Pole Star to a baseline drawn 
between Mars and Venus, and was about to start trying to say it when 
he decided to give it a miss. 

"Long time," he said instead, "in a tank. In a trance." He looked 
round severely at his audience, to make sure it was all following 
attentively. 

He resumed. 

"Where was I?" he said. 

"In a trance," said one. 

"In a tank," said another. 

"Oh yes," said Arthur. "Thank you. And slowly," he said pressing 
onwards, "slowly, slowly, all your excess body fat... turns... to..." he 



paused for effect, "subcoo... subyoo... subtoocay..." - he paused for 
breath - "subcutaneous gold, which you can have surgically removed. 
Getting out of the tank is hell. What did you say?" 

"I was just clearing my throat." 

"I think you doubt me." 

"I was clearing my throat." 

"She was clearing her throat," confirmed a significant part of the 
audience in a low rumble. 

"Oh yes," said Arthur, "all right. And you then split the proceeds..." 
he paused again for a maths break, "fifty-fifty with the alchemist. 
Make a lot of money!" 

He looked swayingly around at his audience, and could not help but 
be aware of an air of scepticism about their jumbled faces. 

He felt very affronted by this. 

"How else," he demanded, "could I afford to have my face 
dropped?" 

Friendly arms began to help him home. "Listen," he protested, as 
the cold February breeze brushed his face, "looking lived-in is all the 
rage in California at the moment. You've got to look as if you've seen 
the Galaxy. Life, I mean. You've got to look as if you've seen life. 

That's what I got. A face drop. Give me eight years, I said. I hope being 
thirty doesn't come back into fashion or I've wasted a lot of money." 

He lapsed into silence for a while as the friendly arms continued to 
help him along the lane to his house. 

"Got in yesterday," he mumbled. "I'm very happy to be home. Or 
somewhere very like it..." 

"Jet lag," muttered one of his friends. "Long trip from California. 
Really mucks you up for a couple of days." 

"I don't think he's been there at all," muttered another. "I wonder 
where he has been. And what's happened to him." 

After a little sleep Arthur got up and pottered round the house a 
bit. He felt woozy and a little low, still disoriented by the journey. He 
wondered how he was going to find Fenny. 

He sat and looked at the fish bowl. He tapped it again, and despite 
being full of water and a small yellow Babel fish which was gulping its 



way around rather dejectedly, it still chimed its deep and resonant 
chime as clearly and mesmerically as before. 

Someone is trying to thank me, he thought to himself. He 
wondered who, and for what. 



Chapter 10 


"At the third stroke it will be one... thirty-two... and twenty 
seconds. 

"Beep... beep... beep." 

Ford Prefect suppressed a little giggle of evil satisfaction, realized 
that he had no reason to suppress it, and laughed out loud, a wicked 
laugh. 

He switched the incoming signal through from the Sub-Etha Net to 
the ship's hi-fi system, and the odd, rather stilted, sing-song voice 
spoke out with remarkable clarity round the cabin. 

"At the third stroke it will be one... thirty-two... and thirty seconds. 

"Beep... beep... beep." 

He tweaked the volume up just a little while keeping a careful eye 
on a rapidly changing table of figures on the ship's computer display. 
For the length of time he had in mind, the question of power 
consumption became significant. He didn't want a murder on his 
conscience. 

"At the third stroke it will be one... thirty-two... and forty seconds. 

"Beep... beep... beep." 

He checked around the small ship. He walked down the short 
corridor. "At the third stroke..." 

He stuck his head into the small, functional, gleaming steel 
bathroom. 

"it will be..." 

It sounded fine in there. 

He looked into the tiny sleeping quarters. 

"... one... thirty-two..." 

It sounded a bit muffled. There was a towel hanging over one of 
the speakers. He took down the towel. 


"... and fifty seconds." 



Fine. 

He checked out the packed cargo hold, and wasn't at all satisfied 
with the sound. There was altogether too much crated junk in the 
way. He stepped back out and waited for the door to seal. He broke 
open a closed control panel and pushed the jettison button. He didn't 
know why he hadn't thought of that before. A whooshing rumbling 
noise died away quickly into silence. After a pause a slight hiss could 
be heard again. 

It stopped. 

He waited for the green light to show and then opened the door 
again on the now empty cargo hold. 

"... one... thirty-three... and fifty seconds." 

Very nice. 

"Beep... beep... beep." 

He then went and had a last thorough examination of the 
emergency suspended animation chamber, which was where he 
particularly wanted it to be heard. 

"At the third stroke it will be one... thirty... four... precisely." 

He shivered as he peered down through the heavily frosted 
covering at the dim bulk of the form within. One day, who knew when, 
it would wake, and when it did, it would know what time it was. Not 
exactly local time, true, but what the heck. 

He double-checked the computer display above the freezer bed, 
dimmed the lights and checked it again. 

"At the third stroke it will be..." 

He tiptoed out and returned to the control cabin. 

"... one... thirty-four and twenty seconds." 

The voice sounded as clear as if he was hearing it over a phone in 
London, which he wasn't, not by a long way. 

He gazed out into the inky night. The star the size of a brilliant 
biscuit crumb he could see in the distance was Zondostina, or as it 
was known on the world from which the rather stilted, sing-song 
voice was being received, Pleiades Zeta. 

The bright orange curve that filled over half the visible area was the 
giant gas planet Sesefras Magna, where the Xaxisian battleships 



docked, and just rising over its horizon was a small cool blue moon, 
Epun. 

"At the third stroke it will be..." 

For twenty minutes he sat and watched as the gap between the 
ship and Epun closed, as the ship's computer teased and kneaded the 
numbers that would bring it into a loop around the little moon, close 
the loop and keep it there, orbiting in perpetual obscurity. 

"One... fifty-nine..." 

His original plan had been to close down all external signalling and 
radiation from the ship, to render it as nearly invisible as possible 
unless you were actually looking at it, but then he'd had an idea he 
preferred. It would now emit one single continuous beam, pencil-thin, 
broadcasting the incoming time signal to the planet of the signal's 
origin, which it would not reach for four hundred years, travelling at 
light speed, but where it would probably cause something of a stir 
when it did. 

"Beep... beep... beep." 

He sniggered. 

He didn't like to think of himself as the sort of person who giggled 
or sniggered, but he had to admit that he had been giggling and 
sniggering almost continuously for well over half an hour now. 

"At the third stroke..." 

The ship was now locked almost perfectly into its perpetual orbit 
round a little known and never visited moon. Almost perfect. 

One thing only remained. He ran again the computer simulation of 
the launching of the ship's little Escape-O-Buggy, balancing actions, 
reactions, tangential forces, all the mathematical poetry of motion, 
and saw that it was good. 

Before he left, he turned out the lights. 

As his tiny little cigar tube of an escape craft zipped out on the 
beginning of its three-day journey to the orbiting space station Port 
Sesefron, it rode for a few seconds a long pencil-thin beam of 
radiation that was starting out on a longer journey still. 

"At the third stroke, it will be two... thirteen... and fifty seconds." 

He giggled and sniggered. He would have laughed out loud but he 
didn't have the room. 



"Beep... beep... beep." 



Chapter 11 


"April showers I hate especially." 

However noncommittally Arthur grunted, the man seemed 
determined to talk to him. He wondered if he should get up and move 
to another table, but there didn't seem to be one free in the whole 
cafeteria. He stirred his coffee fiercely. 

"Bloody April showers. Hate hate hate." 

Arthur stared, frowning, out of the window. A light, sunny spray of 
rain hung over the motorway. Two months he'd been back now. 
Slipping back into his old life had in fact been laughably easy. People 
had such extraordinarily short memories, including him. Eight years of 
crazed wanderings round the Galaxy now seemed to him not so much 
like a bad dream as like a film he had videotaped from the tv and now 
kept in the back of a cupboard without bothering to watch. 

One effect that still lingered though, was his joy at being back. Now 
that the Earth's atmosphere had closed over his head for good, he 
thought, wrongly, everything within it gave him extraordinary 
pleasure. Looking at the silvery sparkle of the raindrops he felt he had 
to protest. 

"Well, I like them," he said suddenly, "and for all the obvious 
reasons. They're light and refreshing. They sparkle and make you feel 
good." 

The man snorted derisively. 

"That's what they all say," he said, and glowered darkly from his 
corner seat. 

He was a lorry driver. Arthur knew this because his opening, 
unprovoked remark had been, "I'm a lorry driver. I hate driving in the 
rain. Ironic isn't it? Bloody ironic." 

If there was a sequitur hidden in this remark, Arthur had not been 
able to divine it and had merely given a little grunt, affable but not 
encouraging. 



But the man had not been deterred then, and was not deterred 
now. "They all say that about bloody April showers," he said. "So 
bloody nice, so bloody refreshing, such charming bloody weather." 

He leaned forward, screwing his face up as if he was going to say 
something about the government. 

"What I want to know is this," he said, "if it's going to be nice 
weather, why," he almost spat, "can't it be nice without bloody 
raining?" 

Arthur gave up. He decided to leave his coffee, which was too hot 
to drink quickly and too nasty to drink cold. 

"Well, there you go," he said and instead got up himself. "Bye." 

He stopped off at the service station shop, then walked back 
through the car park, making a point of enjoying the fine play of rain 
on his face. There was even, he noticed, a faint rainbow glistening 
over the Devon hills. He enjoyed that too. 

He climbed into his battered but adored old black Golf GTi, 
squealed the tyres, and headed out past the islands of petrol pumps 
and on to the slip road back towards the motorway. 

He was wrong in thinking that the atmosphere of the Earth had 
closed finally and for ever above his head. 

He was wrong to think that it would ever be possible to put behind 
him the tangled web of irresolutions into which his galactic travels 
had dragged him. 

He was wrong to think he could now forget that the big, hard, oily, 
dirty, rainbow-hung Earth on which he lived was a microscopic dot on 
a microscopic dot lost in the unimaginable infinity of the Universe. 

He drove on, humming, being wrong about all these things. 

The reason he was wrong was standing by the slip road under a 
small umbrella. 

His jaw sagged. He sprained his ankle against the brake pedal and 
skidded so hard he very nearly turned the car over. 

"Fenny!" he shouted. 

Having narrowly avoided hitting her with the actual car, he hit her 
instead with the car door as he leant across and flung it open at her. 

It caught her hand and knocked away her umbrella, which then 
bowled wildly away across the road. 



"Shit!" yelled Arthur as helpfully as he cold, leapt out of his own 
door, narrowly avoided being run down by McKeena's All-Weather 
Haulage, and watched in horror as it ran down Fenny's umbrella 
instead. The lorry swept along the motorway and away. 

The umbrella lay like a recently swatted daddy-long-legs, expiring 
sadly on the ground. Tiny gusts of wind made it twitch a little. 

He picked it up. 

"Er," he said. There didn't seem to be a lot of point in offering the 
thing back to her. 

"How did you know my name?" she said. 

"Er, well," he said. "Look, I'll get you another one..." 

He looked at her and tailed off. 

She was tallish with dark hair which fell in waves around a pale and 
serious face. Standing still, alone, she seemed almost sombre, like a 
statue to some important but unpopular virtue in a formal garden. 

She seemed to be looking at something other than what she looked 
as if she was looking at. 

But when she smiled, as she did now, it was as if she suddenly 
arrived from somewhere. Warmth and life flooded into her face, and 
impossibly graceful movement into her body. The effect was very 
disconcerting, and it disconcerted Arthur like hell. 

She grinned, tossed her bag into the back and swivelled herself into 
the front seat. 

"Don't worry about the umbrella," she said to him as she climbed 
in. "It was my brother's and he can't have liked it or he wouldn't have 
given it to me." She laughed and pulled on her seatbelt. "You're not a 
friend of my brother's are you?" 

"No." 

Her voice was the only part of her which didn't say "Good". 

Her physical presence there in the car, his car, was quite 
extraordinary to Arthur. He felt, as he let the car pull slowly away, 
that he could hardly think or breathe, and hoped that neither of these 
functions were vital to his driving or they were in trouble. 

So what he had experienced in the other car, her brother's car, the 
night he had returned exhausted and bewildered from his nightmare 
years in the stars had not been the unbalance of the moment, or, if it 
had been, he was at least twice as unbalanced now, and quite liable 



to fall off whatever it is that well-balanced people are supposed to be 
balancing on. 

"So..." he said, hoping to kick the conversation off to an exciting 
start. 

"He was meant to pick me up - my brother - but phoned to say he 
couldn't make it. I asked about buses but the man started to look at 
the calendar rather than a timetable, so I decided to hitch. So." 

"So." 

"So here I am. And what I would like to know, is how you know my 
name." 

"Perhaps we ought to first sort out," said Arthur, looking back over 
his shoulder as he eased his car into the motorway traffic, "where I'm 
taking you." 

Very close, he hoped, or long away. Close would mean she lived 
near him, a long way would mean he could drive her there. 

"I'd like to go to Taunton," she said, "please. If that's all right. It's 
not far. You can drop me at..." 

"You live in Taunton?" he said, hoping that he'd managed to sound 
merely curious rather than ecstatic. Taunton was wonderfully close to 
him. He could... 

"No, London," she said. "There's a train in just under an hour." 

It was the worst thing possible. Taunton was only minutes away up 
the motorway. He wondered what to do, and while he was wondering 
with horror heard himself saying, "Oh, I can take you to London. Let 
me take you to London..." 

Bungling idiot. Why on Earth had he said "let" in that stupid way? 
He was behaving like a twelve-year-old. 

"Are you going to London?" she asked. 

"I wasn't," he said, "but..." Bungling idiot. 

"It's very kind of you," she said, "but really no. I like to go by train." 
And suddenly she was gone. Or rather, that part of her which brought 
her to life was gone. She looked rather distantly out of the window 
and hummed lightly to herself. 

He couldn't believe it. 

Thirty seconds into the conversation, and already he'd blown it. 



Grown men, he told himself, in flat contradiction of centuries of 
accumulated evidence about the way grown men behave, do not 
behave like this. 

Taunton 5 miles, said the signpost. 

He gripped the steering wheel so tightly the car wobbled. He was 
going to have to do something dramatic. 

"Fenny," he said. 

She glanced round sharply at him. 

"You still haven't told me how..." 

"Listen," said Arthur, "I will tell you, though the story is rather 
strange. Very strange." 

She was still looking at him, but said nothing. 

"Listen..." 

"You said that." 

"Did I? Oh. There are things I must talk to you about, and things I 
must tell you... a story I must tell you which would..." He was 
thrashing about. He wanted something along the lines of "Thy 
knotted and combined locks to part, and each particular quill to stand 
on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine" but didn't think he 
could carry it off and didn't like the hedgehog reference. 

"... which would take more than five miles," he settled for in the 
end, rather lamely he was afraid. 

"Well..." 

"Just supposing," he said, "just supposing" - he didn't know what 
was coming next, so he thought he'd just sit back and listen - "that 
there was some extraordinary way in which you were very important 
to me, and that, though you didn't know it, I was very important to 
you, but it all went for nothing because we only had five miles and I 
was a stupid idiot at knowing how to say something very important to 
someone I've only just met and not crash into lorries at the same time, 
what would you say..." he paused helplessly, and looked at her, "I... 
should do?" 

"Watch the road!" she yelped. 

"Shit!" 

He narrowly avoided careering into the side of a hundred Italian 
washing machines in a German lorry. 



"I think," she said, with a momentary sigh of relief, "you should buy 
me a drink before my train goes." 



Chapter 12 


There is, for some reason, something especially grim about pubs 
near stations, a very particular kind of grubbiness, a special kind of 
pallor to the pork pies. 

Worse than the pork pies, though, are the sandwiches. 

There is a feeling which persists in England that making a sandwich 
interesting, attractive, or in any way pleasant to eat is something 
sinful that only foreigners do. 

"Make 'em dry," is the instruction buried somewhere in the 
collective national consciousness, "make 'em rubbery. If you have to 
keep the buggers fresh, do it by washing 'em once a week." 

It is by eating sandwiches in pubs on Saturday lunchtimes that the 
British seek to atone for whatever their national sins have been. 
They're not altogether clear what those sins are, and don't want to 
know either. Sins are not the sort of things one wants to know about. 
But whatever their sins are they are amply atoned for by the 
sandwiches they make themselves eat. 

If there is anything worse than the sandwiches, it is the sausages 
which sit next to them. Joyless tubes, full of gristle, floating in a sea of 
something hot and sad, stuck with a plastic pin in the shape of a chef's 
hat: a memorial, one feels, for some chef who hated the world, and 
died, forgotten and alone among his cats on a back stair in Stepney. 

The sausages are for the ones who know what their sins are and 
wish to atone for something specific. 

"There must be somewhere better," said Arthur. 

"No time," said Fenny, glancing at her watch. "My train leaves in 
half an hour." 

They sat at a small wobbly table. On it were some dirty glasses, and 
some soggy beermats with jokes printed on them. Arthur got Fenny a 
tomato juice, and himself a pint of yellow water with gas in it. And a 
couple of sausages. Fie didn't know why. Fie bought them for 
something to do while the gas settled in his glass. 



The barman dunked Arthur's change in a pool of beer on the bar, 
for which Arthur thanked him. 

"All right," said Fenny, glancing at her watch, "tell me what it is you 
have to tell me." 

She sounded, as well she might, extremely sceptical, and Arthur's 
heart sank. Hardly, he felt, the most conductive setting to try to 
explain to her as she sat there, suddenly cool and defensive, that in a 
sort of out-of-body dream he had had a telepathic sense that the 
mental breakdown she had suffered had been connected with the 
fact that, appearances to the contrary nonwithstanding, the Earth had 
been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, 
something which he alone on Earth knew anything about, having 
virtually witnessed it from a Vogon spaceship, and that furthermore 
both his body and soul ached for her unbearably and he needed to 
got to bed with her as soon as was humanly possible. 

"Fenny," he started. 

"I wonder if you'd like to buy some tickets for our raffle? It's just a 
little one." 

He glanced up sharply. 

"To raise money for Anjie who's retiring." 

"What?" 

"And needs a kidney machine." 

He was being leant over by a rather stiffly slim middle-aged woman 
with a prim knitted suit and a prim little perm, and a prim little smile 
that probably got licked by prim little dogs a lot. 

She was holding out a small book of cloakroom tickets and a 
collecting tin. 

"Only ten pence each," she said, "so you could probably even buy 
two. Without breaking the bank!" She gave a tinkly little laugh and 
then a curiously long sigh. Saying "Without breaking the bank" had 
obviously given her more pleasure than anything since some GIs had 
been billeted on her in the war. 

"Er, yes, all right," said Arthur, hurriedly digging in his pocket and 
producing a couple of coins. 

With infuriating slowness, and prim theatricality, if there was such 
a thing, the woman tore off two tickets and handed them to Arthur. 



"I do hope you win," she said with a smile that suddenly snapped 
together like a piece of advanced origami, "the prizes are so nice." 

"Yes, thank you," said Arthur, pocketing the tickets rather 
brusquely and glancing at his watch. 

He turned towards Fenny. 

So did the woman with the raffle tickets. 

"And what about you, young lady?" she said. "It's for Anjie's kidney 
machine. She's retiring you see. Yes?" She hoisted the little smile even 
further up her face. She would have to stop and let it go soon or the 
skin would surely split. 

"Er, look, here you are," said Arthur, and pushed a fifty pence piece 
at her in the hope that that would see her off. 

"Oh, we are in the money, aren't we?" said the woman, with a long 
smiling sigh. "Down from London are we?" 

"No, that's all right, really," he said with a wave of his hand, and 
she started with an awful deliberation to peel off five tickets, one by 
one. 

"Oh, but you must have your tickets," insisted the woman, "or you 
won't be able to claim your prize. They're very nice prizes, you know. 
Very suitable." 

Arthur snatched the tickets, and said thank you as sharply as he 
could. 

The woman turned to Fenny once again. 

"And now, what about..." 

"No!" Arthur nearly yelled. "These are for her," he explained, 
brandishing the five new tickets. 

"Oh, I see! How nice!" 

She smiled sickeningly at both of them. 

"Well, I do hope you..." 

"Yes," snapped Arthur, "thank you." 

The woman finally departed to the table next to theirs. Arthur 
turned desperately to Fenny, and was relieved to see that she was 
rocking with silent laughter. 

He sighed and smiled. 

"Where were we?" 

"You were calling me Fenny, and I was about to ask you not to." 



"What do you mean?" 

She twirled the little wooden cocktail stick in her tomato juice. 

"It's why I asked if you were a friend of my brother's. Or half- 
brother really. He's the only one who calls me Fenny, and I'm not fond 
of him for it." 

"So what's...?" 

"Fenchurch." 

"What?" 

"Fenchurch." 

"Fenchurch." 

She looked at him sternly. 

"Yes," she said, "and I'm watching you like a lynx to see if you're 
going to ask the same silly question that everybody asks me until I 
want to scream. I shall be cross and disappointed if you do. Plus I shall 
scream. So watch it." 

She smiled, shook her hair a little forward over her face and peered 
at him from behind it. 

"Oh," he said, "that's a little unfair, isn't it?" 

"Yes." 

"Fine." 

"All right," she said with a laugh, "you can ask me. Might as well get 
it over with. Better than have you call me Fenny all the time." 

"Presumably..." said Arthur. 

"We've only got two tickets left, you see, and since you were so 
generous when I spoke to you before..." 

"What?" snapped Arthur. 

The woman with the perm and the smile and the now nearly empty 
book of cloakroom tickets was now waving the two last ones under 
his nose. 

"I thought I'd give the opportunity to you, because the prizes are so 
nice." 

She wrinkled up he nose a little confidentially. 

"Very tasteful. I know you'll like them. And it is for Anjie's 
retirement present you see. We want to give her..." 

"A kidney machine, yes," said Arthur. "Here." 



He held out two more ten pence pieces to her, and took the tickets. 

A thought seemed to strike the woman. It struck her very slowly. 

You could watch it coming in like a long wave on a sandy beach. 

"Oh dear," she said, "I'm not interrupting anything am I?" 

She peered anxiously at both of them. 

"No it's fine," said Arthur. Everything that could possibly be fine," 
he insisted, "is fine. 

"Thank you," he added. 

"I say," she said, in a delightful ecstacy of worry, "you're not... in 
love, are you?" 

"It's very hard to say," said Arthur. "We haven't had a chance to 
talk yet." 

He glanced at Fenchurch. She was grinning. 

The woman nodded with knowing confidentiality. 

"I'll let you see the prizes in a minute," she said, and left. 

Arthur turned, with a sigh, back to the girl that he found it hard to 
say whether he was in love with. 

"You were about to ask me," she said, "a question." 

"Yes," said Arthur. 

"We can do it together if you like," said Fenchurch. "Was I 
found ..." 

"... in a handbag..." joined in Arthur. 

"... in the Left Luggage Office..." they said together. 

"... at Fenchurch street station," they finished. 

"And the answer," said Fenchurch, "is no." 

"Fine," said Arthur. 

"I was conceived there." 

"What?" 

"I was con - " 

"In the Left Luggage Office?" hooted Arthur. 

"No, of course not. Don't be silly. What would my parents be doing 
in the Left Luggage Office?" she said, rather taken aback by the 
suggestion. 

"Well, I don't know," spluttered Arthur, "or rather..." 

"It was in the ticket queue." 



"The..." 

"The ticket queue. Or so they claim. They refuse to elaborate. They 
only say you wouldn't believe how bored it is possible to get in the 
ticket queue at Fenchurch Street Station." 

She sipped demurely at her tomato juice and looked at her watch. 

Arthur continued to gurgle for a moment or two. 

"I'm going to have to go in a minute or two," said Fenchurch, "and 
you haven't begun to tell me whatever this terrifically extraordinary 
thing is that you were so keen to get off your chest." 

"Why don't you let me drive you to London?" said Arthur. "It's 
Saturday, I've got nothing particular to do, I'd..." 

"No," said Fenchurch, "thank you, it's sweet of you, but no. I need 
to be by myself for a couple of days." She smiled and shrugged. 

"But..." 

"You can tell me another time. I'll give you my number." 

Arthur's heart went boom boom churn churn as she scribbled 
seven figures in pencil on a scrap of paper and handed it to him. 

"Now we can relax," she said with a slow smile which filled Arthur 
till he thought he would burst. 

"Fenchurch," he said, enjoying the name as he said it. "I - " 

"A box," said a trailing voice, "of cherry liqueurs, and also, and I 
know you'll like this, a gramophone record of Scottish bagpipe 
music..." 

"Yes thank you, very nice," insisted Arthur. 

"I just thought I'd let you have a look at them," said the permed 
woman, "as you're down from London..." 

She was holding them out proudly for Arthur too see. He could see 
that they were indeed a box of cherry brandy liqueurs and a record of 
bagpipe music. That was what they were. 

"I'll let you have your drink in peace now," she said, patting Arthur 
lightly on his seething shoulder, "but I knew you'd like to see." 

Arthur re-engaged his eyes with Fenchurch's once again, and 
suddenly was at a loss for something to say. A moment had come and 
gone between the two of them, but the whole rhythm of it had been 
wrecked by that stupid, blasted woman. 



"Don't worry," said Fenchurch, looking at him steadily from over 
the top of her glass, "we will talk again." She took a sip. 

"Perhaps," she added, "it wouldn't have gone so well if it wasn't for 
her." She gave a wry little smile and dropped her hair forward over 
her face again. 

It was perfectly true. 

He had to admit it was perfectly true. 



Chapter 13 


That night, at home, as he was prancing round the house 
pretending to be tripping through cornfields in slow motion and 
continually exploding with sudden laughter, Arthur thought he could 
even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music he had won. It was 
eight o'clock and he decided he would make himself, force himself, to 
listen to the whole record before he phoned her. Maybe he should 
even leave it till tomorrow. That would be the cool thing to do. Or 
next week sometime. 

No. No games. He wanted her and didn't care who knew it. He 
definitely and absolutely wanted her, adored her, longed for her, 
wanted to do more things than there were names for with her. 

He actually caught himself saying thinks like "Yippee" as he prances 
ridiculously round the house. Her eyes, her hair, her voice, 
everything... 

He stopped. 

He would put on the record of bagpipe music. Then he would call 
her. 

Would he, perhaps, call her first? 

No. What he would do was this. He would put on the record of 
bagpipe music. He would listen to it, every last banshee wail of it. 
Then he would call her. That was the correct order. That was what he 
would do. 

He was worried about touching things in case they blew up when 
he did so. 

He picked up the record. It failed to blow up. He slipped it out of its 
cover. He opened the record player, he turned on the amp. They both 
survived. He giggled foolishly as he lowered the stylus on to the disc. 

He sat and listened solemnly to "A Scottish Soldier". 

He listened to "Amazing Grace". 

He listened to something about some glen or other. 



He thought about his miraculous lunchtime. 

They had just been on the point of leaving, when they were 
distracted by an awful outbreak of "yoo-hooing". The appallingly 
permed woman was waving to them across the room like some stupid 
bird with a broken wing. Everyone in the pub turned to them and 
seemed to be expecting some sort of response. 

They hadn't listened to the bit about how pleased and happy Anjie 
was going to be about the 4.30p everyone had helped to raise 
towards the cost of her kidney machine, had been vaguely aware that 
someone from the next table had won a box of cherry brandy liqueurs, 
and took a moment or two to cotton on to the fact that the yoo- 
hooing lady was trying to ask them if they had ticket number 37. 

Arthur discovered that he had. He glanced angrily at his watch. 

Fenchurch gave him a push. 

"Go on," she said, "go and get it. Don't be bad tempered. Give 
them a nice speech about how pleased you are and you can give me a 
call and tell me how it went. I'll want to hear the record. Go on." 

She flicked his arm and left. 

The regulars thought his acceptance speech a little over-effusive. It 
was, after all, merely an album of bagpipe music. 

Arthur thought about it, and listened to the music, and kept on 
breaking into laughter. 



Chapter 14 


Ring ring. 

Ring ring. 

Ring ring. 

"Hello, yes? Yes, that's right. Yes. You'll 'ave to speak up, there's an 
awful lot of noise in 'ere. What? 

"No, I only do the bar in the evenings. It's Yvonne who does lunch, 
and Jim, he's the landlord. No, I wasn't on. What? 

"You'll have to speak up. 

"What? No, don't know anything about no raffle. What? 

"No, don't know nothing about it. 'Old on. I'll call Jim." 

The barmaid put her hand over the receiver and called over the 
noisy bar. 

"'Ere, Jim, bloke on the phone says something about he's won a 
raffle. He keeps on saying it's ticket 37 and he's won." 

"No, there was a guy in the pub here won," shouted back the 
barman. 

"He says 'ave we got the ticket." 

"Well how can he think he's won if he hasn't even got a ticket?" 

"Jim says 'ow can you think you've won if you 'aven't even got the 
ticket. What?" 

She put her hand over the receiver again. 

"Jim, 'e keeps effing and blinding at me. Says there's a number on 
the ticket." 

"Course there was a number on the ticket, it was a bloody raffle 
ticket wasn't it?" 

"'E says 'e means its a telephone number on the ticket." 

"Put the phone down and serve the bloody customers, will you?" 



Chapter 15 


Eight hours West sat a man alone on a beach mourning an 
inexplicable loss. He could only think of his loss in little packets of 
grief at a time, because the whole thing was too great to be borne. 

He watched the long slow Pacific waves come in along the sand, 
and waited and waited for the nothing that he knew was about to 
happen. As the time came for it not to happen, it duly didn't happen 
and so the afternoon wore itself away and the sun dropped beneath 
the long line of sea, and the day was gone. 

The beach was a beach we shall not name, because his private 
house was there, but it was a small sandy stretch somewhere along 
the hundreds of miles of coastline that first runs west from Los 
Angeles, which is described in the new edition of the Hitchhiker's 
Guide to the Galaxy in one entry as "junky, wunky, lunky, stunky, and 
what's that other word, and all kinds of bad stuff, woo", and in 
another, written only hours later as "being like several thousand 
square miles of American Express junk mail, but without the same 
sense of moral depth. Plus the air is, for some reason, yellow." 

The coastline runs west, and then turns north up to the misty bay 
of San Francisco, which the Guide describes as a "good place to go. 

It's very easy to believe that everyone you meet there is also a space 
traveller. Starting a new religion for you is just their way of saying 'hi'. 
Until you've settled in and got the hang of the place it is best to say 
'no' to three questions out of any given four that anyone may ask you, 
because there are some very strange things going on there, some of 
which an unsuspecting alien could die of." The hundreds of curling 
miles of cliffs and sand, palm trees, breakers and sunsets are 
described in the Guide as "Boffo. A good one." 

And somewhere on this good boffo stretch of coastline lay the 
house of this inconsolable man, a man whom many regarded as being 
insane. But this was only, as he would tell people, because he was. 



One of the many reasons why people thought him insane was 
because of the peculiarity of his house which, even in a land where 
most people's houses were peculiar in one way or another, was quite 
extreme in his peculiarness. 

His house was called The Outside of the Asylum. 

His name was simply John Watson, though he preferred to be 
called - and some of his friends had now reluctantly agreed to this - 
Wonko the Sane. 

In his house were a number of strange things, including a grey glass 
bowl with eight words engraved upon it. 

We can talk of him much later on - this is just an interlude to watch 
the sun go down and to say that he was there watching it. 

He had lost everything he cared for, and was now simply waiting 
for the end of the world - little realizing that it had already been and 
gone. 



Chapter 16 


After a disgusting Sunday spent emptying rubbish bins behind a 
pub in Taunton, and finding nothing, no raffle ticket, no telephone 
number, Arthur tried everything he could to find Fenchurch, and the 
more things he tried, the more weeks passed. 

He raged and railed against himself, against fate, against the world 
and its weather. He even, in his sorrow and his fury, went and sat in 
the motorway service station cafeteria where he'd been just before 
he met her. 

"It's the drizzle that makes me particularly morose." 

"Please shut up about the drizzle," snapped Arthur. 

"I would shut up if it would shut up drizzling." 

"Look..." 

"But I'll tell you what it will do when it shuts up drizzling, shall I?" 

"No." 

"Blatter." 

"What?" 

"It will blatter." 

Arthur stared over the rim of his coffee cup at the grisly outside 
world. It was a completely pointless place to be, he realized, and he 
had been driven there by superstition rather than logic. However, as if 
to bait him with the knowledge that such coincidences could in fact 
happen, fate had chosen to reunite him with the lorry driver he had 
encountered there last time. 

The more he tried to ignore him, the more he found himself being 
dragged back into the gravitic whirlpool of the man's exasperating 
conversation. 

"I think," said Arthur vaguely, cursing himself for even bothering to 
say this, "that it's easing off." 

"Ha!" 



Arthur just shrugged. He should go. That's what he should do. He 
should just go. 

"It never stops raining!" ranted the lorry driver. He thumped the 
table, spilt his tea, and actually, for a moment, appeared to be 
steaming. 

You can't just walk off without responding to a remark like that. 

"Of course it stops raining," said Arthur. It was hardly an elegant 
refutation, but it had to be said. 

"It rains... all... the time," raved the man, thumping the table again, 
in time to the words. 

Arthur shook his head. 

"Stupid to say it rains all the time..." he said. 

The man's eyebrows shot up, affronted. 

"Stupid? Why's it stupid? Why's it stupid to say it rains all the time 
if it rains the whole time?" 

"Didn't rain yesterday." 

"Did in Darlington." 

Arthur paused, warily. 

"You going to ask me where I was yesterday?" asked the man. 

"Eh?" 

"No," said Arthur. 

"But I expect you can guess." 

"Do you." 

"Begins with a D." 

"Does it." 

"And it was pissing down there, I can tell you." 

"You don't want to sit there, mate," said a passing stranger in 
overalls to Arthur cheerily. "That's Thundercloud Corner that is. 
Reserved special for old Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head here. 
There's one reserved in every motorway caff between here and sunny 
Denmark. Steer clear is my advice. 'Swhat we all do. How's it going, 
Rob? Keeping busy? Got your wet-weather tyres on? Har har." 

He breezed by and went to tell a joke about Britt Ekland to 
someone at a nearby table. 



"See, none of them bastards take me seriously," said Rob McKeena. 
"But," he added darkly, leaning forward and screwing up his eyes, 
"they all know it's true!" 

Arthur frowned. 

"Like my wife," hissed the sole owner and driver of McKeena's All- 
Weather Haulage. "She says it's nonsense and I make a fuss and 
complain about nothing, but," he paused dramatically and darted out 
dangerous looks from his eyes, "she always brings the washing in 
when I phone to say I'm on me way home!" He brandished his coffee 
spoon. "What do you make of that?" 

"Well..." 

"I have a book," he went on, "I have a book. A diary. Kept it for 
fifteen years. Shows every single place I've ever been. Every day. And 
also what the weather was like. And it was uniformly," he snarled, 
"'orrible. All over England, Scotland, Wales I been. All round the 
Continent, Italy, Germany, back and forth to Denmark, been to 
Yugoslavia. It's all marked in and charted. Even when I went to visit 
my brother," he added, "in Seattle." 

"Well," said Arthur, getting up to leave at last, "perhaps you'd 
better show it to someone." 

"I will," said Rob McKeena. 

And he did. 



Chapter 17 


Misery, dejection. More misery and more dejection. He needed a 
project and he gave himself one. 

He would find where his cave had been. 

On prehistoric Earth he had lived in a cave, not a nice cave, a lousy 
cave, but... There was no but. It had been a totally lousy cave and he 
had hated it. But he had lived in it for five years which made it home 
of some kind, and a person likes to keep track of his homes. Arthur 
Dent was such a person and so he went to Exeter to buy a computer. 

That was what he really wanted, of course, a computer. But he felt 
he ought to have some serious purpose in mind before he simply 
went and lashed out a lot of readies on what people might otherwise 
mistake as being just a thing to play with. So that was his serious 
purpose. To pinpoint the exact location of a cave on prehistoric Earth. 
He explained this to the man in the shop. 

"Why?" said the man in the shop. 

This was a tricky one. 

"OK, skip that," said the man in the shop. "How?" 

"Well, I was hoping you could help me with that." 

The man sighed and his shoulders dropped. 

"Have you much experience of computers?" 

Arthur wondered whether to mention Eddie the shipboard 
computer on the Heart of Gold, who could have done the job in a 
second, or Deep Thought, or - but decided he wouldn't. 

"No," he said. 

"Looks like a fun afternoon," said the man in the shop, but he said 
it only to himself. 

Arthur bought the Apple anyway. Over a few days he also acquired 
some astronomical software, plotted the movements of stars, drew 
rough little diagrams of how he seemed to remember the stars to 
have been in the sky when he looked up out of his cave at night, and 



worked away busily at it for weeks, cheerfully putting off the 
conclusion he knew he would inevitably have to come to, which was 
that the whole project was completely ludicrous. 

Rough drawings from memory were futile. He didn't even know 
how long it had been, beyond Ford Prefect's rough guess at the time 
that it was "a couple of million years" and he simply didn't have the 
maths. 

Still, in the end he worked out a method which would at least 
produce a result. He decided not to mind the fact that with the 
extraordinary jumble of rules of thumb, wild approximations and 
arcane guesswork he was using he would be lucky to hit the right 
galaxy, he just went ahead and got a result. 

He would call it the right result. Who would know? 

As it happened, through the myriad and unfathomable chances of 
fate, he got it exactly right, though he of course would never know 
that. He just went up to London and knocked on the appropriate door. 

"Oh. I thought you were going to phone me first." 

Arthur gaped in astonishment. 

"You can only come in for a few minutes," said Fenchurch. "I'm just 
going out." 



Chapter 18 


A summer's day in Islington, full of the mournful wail of antique¬ 
restoring machinery. 

Fenchurch was unavoidably busy for the afternoon, so Arthur 
wandered in a blissed-out haze and looked at all the shops which, in 
Islington, are quite an useful bunch, as anyone who regularly needs 
old woodworking tools, Boer War helmets, drag, office furniture or 
fish will readily confirm. 

The sun beat down over the roofgardens. It beat on architects and 
plumbers. It beat on barristers and burglars. It beat on pizzas. It beat 
on estate agent's particulars. 

It beat on Arthur as he went into a restored furniture shop. 

"It's an interesting building," said the proprietor, cheerfully. 

"There's a cellar with a secret passage which connects with a nearby 
pub. It was built for the Prince Regent apparently, so he could make 
his escape when he needed to." 

"You mean, in case anybody might catch him buying stripped pine 
furniture," said Arthur 

"No," said the proprietor, "not for that reason." 

"You'll have to excuse me," said Arthur. "I'm terribly happy." 

"I see." 

He wandered hazily on and found himself outside the offices of 
Greenpeace. He remembered the contents of his file marked "Things 
to do-urgent!", which he hadn't opened again in the meantime. He 
marched in with a cheery smile and said he'd come to give them some 
money to help free the dolphins. 

"Very funny," they told him, "go away." 

This wasn't quite the response he had expected, so he tried again. 
This time they got quite angry with him, so he just left some money 
anyway and went back out into the sunshine. 



Just after six he returned to Fenchurch's house in the alleyway, 
clutching a bottle of champagne. 

"Hold this," she said, shoved a stout rope in his hand and 
disappeared inside through the large white wooden doors from which 
dangled a fat padlock off a black iron bar. 

The house was a small converted stable in a light industrial 
alleyway behind the derelict Royal Agricultural Hall of Islington. As 
well as its large stable doors it also had a normal-looking front door of 
smartly glazed panelled wood with a black dolphin door knocker. The 
one odd thing about this door was its doorstep, which was nine feet 
high, since the door was set into the upper of the two floors and 
presumably had been originally used to haul in hay for hungry horses. 

An old pulley jutted out of the brickwork above the doorway and it 
was over this that the rope Arthur was holding was slung. The other 
end of the rope held a suspended 'cello. 

The door opened above his head. 

"OK," said Fenchurch, "pull on the rope, steady the 'cello. Pass it up 
to me." 

He pulled on the rope, he steadied the 'cello. 

"I can't pull on the rope again," he said, "without letting go of the 
’cello." 

Fenchurch leant down. 

"I'm steadying the ’cello," she said. "You pull on the rope." 

The 'cello eased up level with the doorway, swinging slightly, and 
Fenchurch manoeuvred it inside. 

"Come on up yourself," she called down. 

Arthur picked up his bag of goodies and went in through the stable 
doors, tingling. 

The bottom room, which he had seen briefly before, was pretty 
rough and full of junk. A large old cast-iron mangle stood there, a 
surprising number of kitchen sinks were piled in a corner. There was 
also, Arthur was momentarily alarmed to see, a pram, but it was very 
old and uncomplicatedly full of books. 

The floor was old stained concrete, excitingly cracked. And this was 
the measure of Arthur's mood as he stared up the rickety wooden 
steps in the far corner. Even a cracked concrete floor seemed to him 
an almost unbearably sensual thing. 



"An architect friend of mine keeps on telling me how he can do 
wonderful things with this place," said Fenchurch chattily as Arthur 
emerged through the floor. "He keeps on coming round, standing in 
stunned amazement muttering about space and objects and events 
and marvellous qualities of light, then says he needs a pencil and 
disappears for weeks. Wonderful things have, therefore, so far failed 
to happen to it." 

In fact, thought Arthur as he looked about, the upper room was at 
least reasonably wonderful anyway. It was simply decorated, 
furnished with things made out of cushions and also a stereo set with 
speakers which would have impressed the guys who put up 
Stonehenge. 

There were flowers which were pale and pictures which were 
interesting. 

There was a sort of gallery structure in the roof space which held a 
bed and also a bathroom which, Fenchurch explained, you could 
actually swing a cat in. "But," she added, "only if it was a reasonably 
patient cat and didn't mind a few nasty cracks about the head. So. 
Here you are." 

"Yes." 

They looked at each other for a moment. 

The moment became a longer moment, and suddenly it was a very 
long moment, so long one could hardly tell where all the time was 
coming from. 

For Arthur, who could usually contrive to feel self-conscious if left 
alone for long enough with a Swiss Cheese plant, the moment was 
one of sustained revelation. He felt on the sudden like a cramped and 
zoo-born animal who awakes one morning to find the door to his cage 
hanging quietly open and the savannah stretching grey and pink to 
the distant rising sun, while all around new sounds are waking. 

He wondered what the new sounds were as he gazed at her openly 
wondering face and her eyes that smiled with a shared surprise. 

He hadn't realized that life speaks with a voice to you, a voice that 
brings you answers to the questions you continually ask of it, had 
never consciously detected it or recognized its tones till it now said 
something it had never said to him before, which was "Yes". 



Fenchurch dropped her eyes away at last, with a tiny shake of her 
head. 

"I know," she said. "I shall have to remember," she added, "that 
you are the sort of person who cannot hold on to a simple piece of 
paper for two minutes without winning a raffle with it." 

She turned away. 

"Let's go for a walk," she said quickly. "Hyde Park. I'll change into 
something less suitable." 

She was dressed in a rather severe dark dress, not a particularly 
shapely one, and it didn't really suit her. 

"I wear it specially for my 'cello teacher," she said. "He's a nice boy, 
but I sometimes think all that bowing gets him a bit excited. I'll be 
down in a moment." 

She ran lightly up the steps to the gallery above, and called down, 
"Put the bottle in the fridge for later." 

He noticed as he slipped the champagne bottle into the door that it 
had an identical twin to sit next to. 

He walked over to the window and looked out. He turned and 
started to look at her records. From above he heard the rustle of her 
dress fall to the ground. He talked to himself about the sort of person 
he was. He told himself very firmly that for this moment at least he 
would keep his eyes very firmly and steadfastly locked on to the 
spines of her records, read the titles, nod appreciatively, count the 
blasted things if he had to. He would keep his head down. 

This he completely, utterly and abjectly failed to do. 

She was staring down at him with such intensity that she seemed 
hardly to notice that he was looking up at her. Then suddenly she 
shook her head, dropped the light sundress over herself and 
disappeared quickly into the bathroom. 

She emerged a moment later, all smiles and with a sunhat and 
came tripping down the steps with extraordinary lightness. It was a 
strange kind of dancing motion she had. She saw that he noticed it 
and put her head slightly on one side. 

"Like it?" she said. 

"You look gorgeous," he said simply, because she did. 

"Hmmmm," she said, as if he hadn't really answered her question. 



She closed the upstairs front door which had stood open all this 
time, and looked around the little room to see that it was all in a fit 
state to be left on its own for a while. Arthur's eyes followed hers 
around, and while he was looking in the other direction she slipped 
something out of a drawer and into the canvas bag she was carrying. 

Arthur looked back at her. 

"Ready?" 

"Did you know," she said with a slightly puzzled smile, "that there's 
something wrong with me?" 

Her directness caught Arthur unprepared. 

"Well," he said, "I'd heard some vague sort of..." 

"I wonder how much you do know about me," she said. "I you 
heard it from where I think you heard then that's not it. Russell just 
sort of makes stuff up, because he can't deal with what it really is." 

A pang of worry went through Arthur. 

"Then what is it?" he said. "Can you tell me?" 

"Don't worry," she said, "it's nothing bad at all. Just unusual. Very 
very unusual." 

She touched his hand, and then leant forward and kissed him 
briefly. 

"I shall be very interested to know," she said, "if you manage to 
work out what it is this evening." 

Arthur felt that if someone tapped him at that point he would have 
chimed, like the deep sustained rolling chime his grey fishbowl made 
when he flicked it with his thumbnail. 



Chapter 19 


Ford Prefect was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound 
of gunfire. 

He slid himself out of the maintenance hatchway which he had 
fashioned into a bunk for himself by disabling some of the noisier 
machinery in his vicinity and padding it with towels. He slung himself 
down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily. 

They were claustrophobic and ill-lit, and what light there was 
continually flickering and dimming as power surged this way and that 
through the ship, causing heavy vibrations and rasping humming 
noises. 

That wasn't it, though. 

He paused and leaned back against the wall as something that 
looked like a small silver power drill flew past him down the dim 
corridor with a nasty searing screech. 

That wasn't it either. 

He clambered listlessly through a bulkhead door and found himself 
in a larger corridor, though still ill-lit. 

The ship lurched. It had been doing this a fair bit, but this was 
heavier. A small platoon of robots weent by making a terrible 
clattering. 

Still not it, though. 

Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end of the corridor, so he 
walked along it in the other direction. 

He passed a series of observation monitors let into the walls 
behind plates of toughened but still badly scratched perspex. 

One of them showed some horrible green scaly reptilian figure 
ranting and raving about the Single Transferable Vote system. It was 
hard to tell whether he was for or against it, but he clearly felt very 
strongly about it. Ford turned the sound down. 

That wasn't it, though. 



He passed another monitor. It was showing a commercial for some 
brand of toothpaste that would apparently make you feel free if you 
used it. There was nasty blaring music with it too, but that wasn't it. 

He came upon another, much larger three-dimensional screen that 
was monitoring the outside of the vast silver Xaxisian ship. 

As he watched, a thousand horribly beweaponed Zirzla robot 
starcruisers came searing round the dark shadow of a moon, 
silhouetted against the blinding disc of the star Xaxis, and the ship 
simultaneously unleashed a vicious blaze of hideously 
incomprehensible forces from all its orifices against them. 

That was it. 

Ford shook his head irritably and rubbed his eyes. He slumped on 
the wrecked body of a dull silver robot which clearly had been 
burning earlier on, but had now cooled down enough to sit on. 

He yawned and dug his copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 
out of his satchel. He activated the screen, and flicked idly through 
some level three entries and some level four entries. He was looking 
for some good insomnia cures. He found REST, which was what he 
reckoned he needed. He found REST AND RECUPERATION and was 
about to pass on when he suddenly had a better idea. He looked up at 
the monitor screen. The battle was raging more fiercely every second 
and the noise was appalling. The ship juddered, screamed, and 
lurched as each new bolt of stunning energy was delivered or 
received. 

He looked back down at the Guide again and flipped through a few 
likely locations. He suddenly laughed, and then rummaged in his 
satchel again. 

He pulled out a small memory dump module, wiped off the fluff 
and biscuit crumbs, and plugged it into an interface on the back of the 
Guide. 

When all the information that he could think was relevant had 
been dumped into the module, he unplugged it again, tossed it lightly 
in the palm of his hand, put the Guide away in his satchel, smirked, 
and went in search of the ship's computer data banks. 



Chapter 20 


"The purpose of having the sun go low in the evenings, in the 
summer, especially in parks," said the voice earnestly, "is to make 
girl's breasts bob up and down more clearly to the eye. I am 
convinced that this is the case." 

Arthur and Fenchurch giggled about this to each other as they 
passed. She hugged him more tightly for a moment. 

"And I am certain," said the frizzy ginger-haired youth with the long 
thin nose who was epostulating from his deckchair by the side of the 
Serpentine, "that if one worked the argument through, one would 
find that it flowed with perfect naturalness and logic from 
everything," he insisted to his thin dark-haired companion who was 
slumped in the next door deckchair feeling dejected about his spots, 
"that Darwin was going on about. This is certain. This is indisputable. 
And," he added, "I love it." 

He turned sharply and squinted through his spectacles at 
Fenchurch. Arthur steered her away and could feel her silently 
quaking. 

"Next guess," she said, when she had stopped giggling, "come on." 

"All right," he said, "your elbow. Your left elbow. There's something 
wrong with your left elbow." 

"Wrong again," she said, "completely wrong. You're on completely 
the wrong track." 

The summer sun was sinking through the tress in the park, looking 
as if - Let's not mince words. Hyde Park is stunning. Everything about 
it is stunning except for the rubbish on Monday mornings. Even the 
ducks are stunning. Anyone who can go through Hyde Park on a 
summer's evening and not feel moved by it is probably going through 
in an ambulance with the sheet pulled over their face. 

It is a park in which people do more extraordinary things than they 
do elsewhere. Arthur and Fenchurch found a man in shorts practising 
the bagpipes to himself under a tree. The piper paused to chase off an 



American couple who had tried, timidly to put some coins on the box 
his bagpipes came in. 

"No!" he shouted at them, "go away! I'm only practising." 

He started resolutely to reinflate his bag, but even the noise this 
made could not disfigure their mood. 

Arthur put his arms around her and moved them slowly 
downwards. 

"I don't think it can be your bottom," he said after a while," there 
doesn't seem to be anything wrong with that at all." 

"Yes," she agreed, "there's absolutely nothing wrong with my 
bottom." 

They kissed for so long that eventually the piper went and 
practised on the other side of the tree. 

"I'll tell you a story," said Arthur. 

"Good." 

They found a patch of grass which was relatively free of couples 
actually lying on top of each other and sat and watched the stunning 
ducks and the low sunlight rippling on the water which ran beneath 
the stunning ducks. 

"A story," said Fenchurch, cuddling his arm to her. 

"Which will tell you something of the sort of things that happen to 
me. It's absolutely true." 

"You know sometimes people tell you stories that are supposed to 
be something that happened to their wife's cousin's best friend, but 
actually probably got made up somewhere along the line." 

"Well, it's like one of those stories, except that it actually happened, 
and I know it actually happened, because the person it actually 
happened to was me." 

"Like the raffle ticket." 

Arthur laughed. "Yes. I had a train to catch," he went on. "I arrived 
at the station..." 

"Did I ever tell you," interrupted Fenchurch, "what happened to my 
parents in a station?" 

"Yes," said Arthur, "you did." 

"Just checking." 



Arthur glanced at his watch. "I suppose we could think of getting 
back," he said. 

"Tell me the story," said Fenchurch firmly. "You arrived at the 
station." 

"I was about twenty minutes early. I'd got the time of the train 
wrong. I suppose it is at least equally possible," he added after a 
moment's reflection, "that British Rail had got the time of the train 
wrong. Hadn't occurred to me before." 

"Get on with it." Fenchurch laughed. 

"So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the 
buffet to get a cup of coffee." 

"You do the crossword?" 

"Yes." 

"Which one?" 

"The Guardian usually." 

"I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer the Times. Did you solve it?" 

"What?" 

"The crossword in The Guardian." 

"I haven't had a chance to look at it yet," said Arthur, "I'm still 
trying to buy the coffee." 

"All right then. Buy the coffee." 

"I'm buying it. I am also," said Arthur, "buying some biscuits." 

"What sort?" 

"Rich Tea." 

"Good choice." 

"I like them. Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a 
table. And don't ask me what the table was like because this was 
some time ago and I can't remember. It was probably round." 

"All right." 

"So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table. On my left, 
the newspaper. On my right, the cup of coffee. In the middle of the 
table, the packet of biscuits." 

"I see it perfectly." 



"What you don't see," said Arthur, "because I haven't mentioned 
him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there 
opposite me." 

"What's he like?" 

"Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn't look," said 
Arthur, "as if he was about to do anything weird." 

"Ah. I know the type. What did he do?" 

"He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of 
biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and..." 

"What?" 

"Ate it." 

"What?" 

"He ate it." 

Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment. "What on Earth did you 
do?" 

"Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman 
would do. I was compelled," said Arthur, "to ignore it." 

"What? Why?" 

"Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for is it? I searched 
my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my 
upbringing, experience or even primal instincts to tell me how to 
react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in 
front of me, stolen one of my biscuits." 

"Well, you could..." Fenchurch thought about it. "I must say I'm not 
sure what I would have done either. So what happened?" 

"I stared furiously at the crossword," said Arthur. "Couldn't do a 
single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was 
nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to 
notice," he added, "that the packet was already mysteriously open..." 

"But you're fighting back, taking a tough line." 

"After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately 
and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was 
doing. When I eat a biscuit," Arthur said, "it stays eaten." 

"So what did he do?" 



"Took another one. Honestly," insisted Arthur, "this is exactly what 
happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain 
as we are sitting on the ground." 

Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably. 

"And the problem was," said Arthur, "that having not said anything 
the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the 
subject the second time around. What do you say? 'Excuse me... I 
couldn't help noticing, er...' Doesn't work. No, I ignored it with, if 
anything, even more vigour than previously." 

"My man..." 

"Stared at the crossword, again, still couldn't budge a bit of it, so 
showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St Crispin's Day..." 

"What?" 

"I went into the breach again. I took," said Arthur, "another biscuit. 
And for an instant our eyes met." 

"Like this?" 

"Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. 
And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you," said Arthur, 

"that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension 
building up over the table. At about this time." 

"I can imagine." 

"We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me ..." 

"The whole packet?" 

"Well it was only eight biscuits but it seemed like a lifetime of 
biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly 
have had a tougher time." 

"Gladiators," said Fenchurch, "would have had to do it in the sun. 
More physically gruelling." 

"There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead between 
us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a 
sigh of relief, of course. As it happened, my train was announced a 
moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the 
newspaper, and underneath the newspaper..." 

"Yes?" 

"Were my biscuits." 

"What?" said Fenchurch. "What?" 



"True." 

"No!" She gasped and tossed herself back on the grass laughing. 

She sat up again. 

"You completely nitwit," she hooted, "you almost completely and 
utterly foolish person." 

She pushed him backwards, rolled over him, kissed him and rolled 
off again. He was surprised at how light she was. 

"Now you tell me a story." 

"I thought," she said putting on a low husky voice, "that you were 
very keen to get back." 

"No hurry," he said airily, "I want you to tell me a story." 

She looked out over the kale and pondered. 

"All right," she said, "it's only a short one. And not funny like yours, 
but... Anyway." 

She looked down. Arthur could feel that it was one of those sorts of 
moments. The air seemed to stand still around them, waiting. Arthur 
wished that the air would go away and mind its own business. 

"When I was a kid," she said. "These sort of stories always start like 
this, don't they, 'When I was a kid...' Anyway. This is the bit where the 
girl suddenly says, 'When I was a kid' and starts to unburden herself. 
We have got to that bit. When I was a kid I had this picture hanging 
over the foot of my bed... What do you think of it so far?" 

"I like it. I think it's moving well. You're getting the bedroom 
interest in nice and early. We could probably do with some 
development with the picture." 

"It was one of those pictures that children are supposed to like," 
she said, "but don't. Full of endearing little animals doing endearing 
things, you know?" 

"I know. I was plagued with them too. Rabbits in waistcoats." 

"Exactly. These rabbits were in fact on a raft, as were assorted rats 
and owls. There may even have been a reindeer." 

"On the raft." 

"On the raft. And a boy was sitting on the raft." 

"Among the rabbits in waistcoats and the owls and the reindeer." 

"Precisely there. A boy of the cheery gypsy ragamuffin variety." 

"Ugh." 



"The picture worried me, I must say. There was an otter swimming 
in front of the raft, and I used to lie awake at night worrying about 
this otter having to pull the raft, with all these wretched animals on it 
who shouldn't even be on a raft, and the otter had such a thin tail to 
pull it with I thought it must hurt pulling it all the time. Worried me. 
Not badly, but just vaguely, all the time. 

"Then one day - and remember I'd been looking at this picture 
every night for years - I suddenly noticed that the raft had a sail. 
Never seen it before. The otter was fine, he was just swimming 
along." 

She shrugged. 

"Good story?" she said. 

"Ends weakly," said Arthur, "leaves the audience crying 'Yes, but 
what of it?' Fine up till there, but needs a final sting before the 
credits." 

Fenchurch laughed and hugged her legs. 

"It was just such a sudden revelation, years of almost unnoticed 
worry just dropping away, like taking off heavy weights, like black and 
white becoming colour, like a dry stick suddenly being watered. The 
sudden shift of perspective that says 'Put away your worries, the 
world is a good and perfect place. It is in fact very easy.' You probably 
thing I'm saying that because I'm going to say that I felt like that this 
afternoon or something, don't you?" 

"Well, I..." said Arthur, his composure suddenly shattered. 

"Well, it's all right," she said, "I did. That's exactly what I felt. But 
you see, I've felt that before, even stronger. Incredibly strongly. I'm 
afraid I'm a bit of a one," she said gazing off into the distance, "for 
sudden startling revelations." 

Arthur was at sea, could hardly speak, and felt it wiser, therefore, 
for the moment not to try. 

"It was very odd," she said, much as one of the pursuing Egyptians 
might have said that the behaviour of the Red Sea when Moses 
waved his rod at it was a little on the strange side. 

"Very odd," she repeated, "for days before, the strangest feeling 
had been building in me, as if I was going to give birth. No, it wasn't 
like that in fact, it was more as if I was being connected into 



something, bit by bit. No, not even that; it was as if the whole of the 
Earth, through me, was going to..." 

"Does the number," said Arthur gently, "forty-two mean anything 
to you at all?" 

"What? No, what are you talking about?" exclaimed Fenchurch. 

"Just a thought," murmured Arthur. 

"Arthur, I mean this, this is very real to me, this is serious." 

"I was being perfectly serious," said Arthur. "It's just the Universe 
I'm never quite sure about." 

"What do you mean by that?" 

"Tell me the rest of it," he said. "Don't worry if it sounds odd. 

Believe me, you are talking to someone who has seen a lot of stuff," 
he added, "that is odd. And I don't mean biscuits." 

She nodded, and seemed to believe him. Suddenly, she gripped his 
arm. 

"It was so simple," she said, "so wonderfully and extraordinarily 
simple, when it came." 

"What was it?" said Arthur quietly. 

"Arthur, you see," she said, "that's what I no longer know. And the 
loss is unbearable. If I try to think back to it, it all goes flickery and 
jumpy, and if I try too hard, I get as far as the teacup and I just black 
out." 

"What?" 

"Well, like your story," she said, "the best bit happened in a cafe. I 
was sitting there, having a cup of tea. This was after days of this build 
up, the feeling of becoming connected up. I think I was buzzing gently. 
And there was some work going on at a building site opposite the cafe, 
and I was watching it through the window, over the rim of my teacup, 
which I always find is the nicest way of watching other people 
working. And suddenly, there it was in my mind, this message from 
somewhere. And it was so simple. It made such sense of everything. I 
just sat up and thought, 'Oh! Oh, well that's all right then.' I was so 
startled I almost dropped my teacup, in fact I think I did drop it. Yes," 
she added thoughtfully, "I'm sure I did. How much sense am I 
making?" 

"It was fine up to the bit about the teacup." 



She shook her head, and shook it again, as if trying to clear it, 
which is what she was trying to do. 

"Well that's it," she said. "Fine up to the bit about the teacup. That 
was the point at which it seemed to me quite literally as if the world 
exploded." 

"What...?" 

"I know it sounds crazy, and everybody says it was hallucinations, 
but if that was hallucinations then I have hallucinations in big screen 
3D with 16-track Dolby Stereo and should probably hire myself out to 
people who are bored with shark movies. It was as if the ground was 
literally ripped from under my feet, and... and..." 

She patted the grass lightly, as if for reassurance, and then seemed 
to change her mind about what she was going to say. 

"And I woke up in hospital. I suppose I've been in and out ever 
since. And that's why I have an instinctive nervousness," she said, "of 
sudden startling revelations that's everything's going to be all right." 
She looked up at him. 

Arthur had simply ceased to worry himself about the strange 
anomalies surrounding his return to his home world, or rather had 
consigned them to that part of his mind marked "Things to think 
about - Urgent." "Here is the world," he had told himself. "Here, for 
whatever reason, is the world, and here it stays. With me on it." But 
now it seemed to go swimmy around him, as it had that night in the 
car when Fenchurch's brother had told him the silly stories about the 
CIA agent in the reservoir. The trees went swimmy. The lake went 
swimmy, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be alarmed by 
because a grey goose had just landed on it. The geese were having a 
great relaxed time and had no major answers they wished to know 
the questions to. 

"Anyway," said Fenchurch, suddenly and brightly and with a wide- 
eyed smile, "there is something wrong with part of me, and you've 
got to find out what it is. We'll go home." 

Arthur shook his head. 

"What's the matter?" she said. 

Arthur had shaken his head, not to disagree with her suggestion 
which he thought was a truly excellent one, one of the world's great 
suggestions, but because he was just for a moment trying to free 



himself of the recurring impression he had that just when he was 
least expecting it the Universe would suddenly leap out from behind a 
door and go boo at him. 

"I'm just trying to get this entirely clear in my mind," said Arthur, 
"you say you felt as if the Earth actually... exploded ..." 

"Yes. More than felt." 

"Which is what everybody else says," he said hesitantly, "is 
hallucinations?" 

"Yes, but Arthur that's ridiculous. People think that if you just say 
'hallucinations' it explains anything you want it to explain and 
eventually whatever it is you can't understand will just go away. It's 
just a word, it doesn't explain anything. It doesn't explain why the 
dolphins disappeared." 

"No," said Arthur. "No," he added thoughtfully. "No," he added 
again, even more thoughtfully. "What?" he said at last. 

"Doesn't explain the dolphins disappearing." 

"No," said Arthur, "I see that. Which dolphins do you mean?" 

"What do you mean which dolphins? I'm talking about when all the 
dolphins disappeared." 

She put her hand on his knee, which made him realize that the 
tingling going up and down his spine was not her gently stroking his 
back, and must instead be one of the nasty creepy feelings he so 
often got when people were trying to explain things to him. 

"The dolphins?" 

"Yes." 

"All the dolphins," said Arthur, "disappeared?" 

"Yes." 

"The dolphins? You're saying the dolphins all disappeared? Is this," 
said Arthur, trying to be absolutely clear on this point, "what you're 
saying?" 

"Arthur where have you been for heaven's sake? The dolphins all 
disappeared on the same day I..." 

She stared him intently in his startled eyes. 

"What...?" 

"No dolphins. All gone. Vanished." 

She searched his face. 



"Did you really not know that?" 

It was clear from his startled expression that he did not. 

"Where did they go?" he asked. 

"No one knows. That's what vanished means." She paused. "Well, 
there is one man who says he knows about it, but everyone says he 
lives in California," she said, "and is mad. I was thinking of going to 
see him because it seems the only lead I've got on what happened to 
me." 

She shrugged, and then looked at him long and quietly. She lay her 
hand on the side of his face. 

"I really would like to know where you've been," she said. "I think 
something terrible happened to you then as well. And that's why we 
recognized each other." 

She glanced around the park, which was now being gathered into 
the clutches of dusk. 

"Well," she said, "now you've got someone you can tell." 

Arthur slowly let out a long year of a sigh. 

"It is," he said, "a very long story." 

Fenchurch leaned across him and drew over her canvas bag. 

"Is it anything to do with this?" she said. The thing she took out of 
her bag was battered and travelworn as it had been hurled into 
prehistoric rivers, baked under the sun that shines so redly on the 
deserts of Kakrafoon, half-buried in the marbled sands that fringe the 
heady vapoured oceans of Santraginus V, frozen on the glaciers of the 
moon of Jaglan Beta, sat on, kicked around spaceships, scuffed and 
generally abused, and since its makers had thought that these were 
exactly the sorts of things that might happen to it, they had 
thoughtfully encased it in a sturdy plastic cover and written on it, in 
large friendly letters, the words "Don't Panic". 

"Where did you get this?" said Arthur, startled, taking it from her. 

"Ah," she said, "I thought it was yours. In Russell's car that night. 
You dropped it. Have you been to many of these places?" 

Arthur drew the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy from its cover. It 
was like a small, thin, flexible lap computer. He tapped some buttons 
till the screen flared with text. 


"A few," he said. 



"Can we go to them?" 

"What? No," said Arthur abruptly, then relented, but relented 
warily. "Do you want to?" he said, hoping for the answer no. It was an 
act of great generosity on his part not to say, "You don't want to, do 
you?" which expects it. 

"Yes," she said. "I want to know what the message was that I lost, 
and where it came from. Because I don't think," she added, standing 
up and looking round the increasing gloom of the park, "that it came 
from here." 

"I'm not even sure," she further added, slipping her arm around 
Arthur's waist, "that I know where here is." 



Chapter 21 


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is, as has been remarked 
before often and accurately, a pretty startling kind of a thing. It is, 
essentially, as the title implies, a Guide book. The problem is, or 
rather one of the problems, for there are many, a sizeable portion of 
which are continually clogging up the civil, commercial and criminal 
courts in all areas of the Galaxy, and especially, where possible, the 
more corrupt ones, this. 

The previous sentence makes sense. That is not the problem. 

This is: 

Change. 

Read it through again and you'll get it. 

The Galaxy is a rapidly changing place. There is, frankly, so much of 
it, every bit of which is continually on the move, continually changing. 
A bit of a nightmare, you might think, for a scrupulous and 
conscientious editor diligently striving to keep this massively detailed 
and complex electronic tome abreast of all the changing 
circumstances and conditions that the Galaxy throws up every minute 
of every hour of every day, and you would be wrong. Where you 
would be wrong would be in failing to realize that the editor, like all 
the editors of the Guide has ever had, has no real grasp of the 
meanings of the words "scrupulous", "conscientious" or "diligent", 
and tends to get his nightmares through a straw. 

Entries tend to get updated or not across the Sub-Etha Net 
according to if they read good. 

Take for example, the case of Brequinda on the Foth of Avalars, 
famed in myth, legend and stultifyingly dull tri-d mini-serieses as 
home of the magnificent and magical Fuolornis Fire Dragon. 

In Ancient days, when Fragilis sang and Saxaquine of the Quenelux 
held sway, when the air was sweet and the nights fragrant, but 
everyone somehow managed to be, or so they claimed, though how 
on earth they could have thought that anyone was even remotely 



likely to believe such a preposterous claim what with all the sweet air 
and fragrant nights and whatnot is anyone's guess, virgins, it was not 
possible to heave a brick on Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars without 
hitting at least half a dozen Fuolornis Fire Dragons. 

Whether you would want to do that is another matter. 

Not that Fire Dragons weren't an essentially peace-loving species, 
because they were. They adored it to bits, and this wholesale adoring 
of things to bits was often in itself the problem: one so often hurts the 
one loves, especially if one is a Fuolornis Fire Dragon with breath like 
a rocket booster and teeth like a park fence. Another problem was 
that once they were in the mood they often went on to hurt quite a 
lot of the ones that other people loved as well. Add to all that the 
relatively small number of madmen who actually went around the 
place heaving bricks, and you end up with a lot of people on 
Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars getting seriously hurt by dragons. 

But did they mind? They did not. 

Were they heard to bemoan their fate? No. 

The Fuolornis Fire Dragons were revered throughout the lands of 
Brequinda in the Foth of valors for their savage beauty, their noble 
ways and their habit of biting people who didn't revere them. 

Why was this? 

The answer was simple. 

Sex. 

There is, for some unfathomed reason, something almost 
unbearably sexy about having huge fire-breathing magical dragons 
flying low about the sky on moonlit nights which were already 
dangerously on the sweet and fragrant side. 

Why this should be so, the romance-besotted people of Brequinda 
in the Foth of Avalars could not have told you, and would not have 
stopped to discuss the matter once the effect was up and going, for 
no sooner would a flock of half a dozen silk-winged leather-bodied 
Fuolornis Fire Dragons heave into sight across the evening horizon 
than half the people of Brequinda are scurrying off into the woods 
with the other half, there to spend a busy breathless night together 
and emerge with the first rays of dawn all smiling and happy and still 
claiming, rather endearingly, to be virgins, if rather flushed and sticky 
virgins. 



Pheromones, some researchers said. 

Something sonic, others claimed. 

The place was always stiff with researchers trying to get to the 
bottom of it all and taking a very long time about it. 

Not surprisingly, the Guide's graphically enticing description of the 
general state of affairs on this planet has proved to be astonishingly 
popular amongst hitch-hikers who allow themselves to be Guided by 
it, and so it has simply never been taken out, and it is therefore left to 
latter-day travellers to find out for themselves that today's modern 
Brequinda in the City State of Avalars is now little more than concrete, 
strip joints and Dragon Burger Bars. 



Chapter 22 


The night in Islington was sweet and fragrant. 

There were, of course, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons about in the alley, 
but if any had chanced by they might just as well have sloped off 
across the road for a pizza, for they were not going to be needed. 

Had an emergency cropped up while they were still in the middle 
of their American Flots with extra anchovy they could always have 
sent across a message to put Dire Straits on the stereo, which is now 
known to have much the same effect. 

"No," said Fenchurch, "not yet." 

Arthur put Dire Straits on the stereo. Fenchurch pushed ajar the 
upstairs front door to let in a little more of the sweet fragrant night 
air. They both sat on some of the furniture made out of cushions, very 
close to the open bottle of champagne. 

"No," said Fenchurch, "not till you've found out what's wrong with 
me, which bit. But I suppose," she added very, very, very quietly, "that 
we may as well start with where your hand is now." 

Arthur said, "So which way do I go?" 

"Down," said Fenchurch, "on this occasion." 

Fie moved his hand. 

"Down," she said, "is in fact the other way." 

"Oh yes." 

Mark Knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a Schecter 
Custom Stratocaster hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night, 
exhausted from being good all week and needing a stiff beer - which 
is not strictly relevant at this point since the record hadn't yet got to 
that bit, but there will be too much else going on when it does, and 
furthermore the chronicler does not intend to sit here with a track list 
and a stopwatch, so it seems best to mention it now while things are 
still moving slowly. 



"And so we come," said Arthur, "to your knee. There is something 
terribly and tragically wrong with your left knee." 

"My left knee," said Fenchurch, "is absolutely fine." 

"Do it is." 

"Did you know that..." 

"What?" 

"Ahm, it's all right. I can tell you do. No, keep going." 

"So it has to be something to do with your feet..." 

She smiled in the dim light, and wriggled her shoulders 
noncommittally against the cushions. Since there are cushions in the 
Universe, on Squornshellous Beta to be exact, two worlds in from the 
swampland of the mattresses, that actively enjoy being wriggled 
against, particularly if it's noncommittally because of the syncopated 
way in which the shoulders move, it's a pity they weren't there. They 
weren't, but such is life. 

Arthur held her left foot in his lap and looked it over carefully. All 
kinds of stuff about the way her dress fell away from her legs was 
making it difficult for him to think particularly clearly at this point. 

"I have to admit," he said, "that I really don't know what I'm 
looking for." 

"You'll know when you find it," she said. "Really you will." There 
was a slight catch in her voice. "It's not that one." 

Feeling increasingly puzzled, Arthur let her left foot down on the 
floor and moved himself around so that he could take her right foot. 
She moved forward, put her arms round and kissed him, because the 
record had got to that bit which, if you knew the record, you would 
know made it impossible not to do this. 

Then she gave him her right foot. 

Fie stroked it, ran his fingers round her ankle, under her toes, along 
her instep, could find nothing wrong with it. 

She watched him with great amusement, laughed and shook her 
head. 

"No, don't stop," she said, "but it's not that one now." 

Arthur stopped, and frowned at her left foot on the floor. 

"Don't stop." 



He stroked her right foot, ran his fingers around her ankle, under 
her toes, along her instep and said, "You mean it's something to do 
with which leg I'm holding...?" 

She did another of the shrugs which would have brought such joy 
into the life of a simple cushion from Squornshellous Beta. 

He frowned. 

"Pick me up," she said quietly. 

He let her right foot down to the floor and stood up. So did she. He 
picked her up in his arms and they kissed again. This went on for a 
while, then she said, "Now put me down again." 

Still puzzled, he did so. 

"Well?" 

She looked at him almost challengingly. 

"So what's wrong with my feet?" she said. 

Arthur still did not understand. He sat on the floor, then got down 
on his hands and knees to look at her feet, in situ, as it were, in their 
normal habitat. And as he looked closely, something odd struck him. 
He pit his head right down to the ground and peered. There was a 
long pause. He sat back heavily. 

"Yes," he said, "I see what's wrong with your feet. They don't touch 
the ground." 

"So... so what do you think...?" 

Arthur looked up at her quickly and saw the deep apprehension 
making her eyes suddenly dark. She bit her lip and was trembling. 

"What do..." she stammered. "Are you...?" She shook the hair 
forwards over her eyes that were filling with dark fea rful tears. 

He stood up quickly, put his arms around her and gave her a single 
kiss. 

"Perhaps you can do what I can do," he said, and walked straight 
out of her upstairs front door. 

The record got to the good bit. 



Chapter 23 


The battle raged on about the star of Xaxis. Hundreds of the fierce 
and horribly beweaponed Zirzla ships had now been smashed and 
wrenched to atoms by the withering forces the huge silver Xaxisian 
ship was able to deploy. 

Part of the moon had gone too, blasted away by those same 
blazing forceguns that ripped the very fabric of space as they passed 
through it. 

The Zirzla ships that remained, horribly beweaponed though they 
were, were now hopelessly outclassed by the devastating power of 
the Xaxisian ship, and were fleeing for cover behind the rapidly 
disintegrating moon, when the Xaxisian ship, in hurtling pursuit 
behind them, suddenly announced that it needed a holiday and left 
the field of battle. 

All was redoubled fear and consternation for a moment, but the 
ship was gone. 

With the stupendous powers at its command it flitted across vast 
tracts of irrationally shaped space, quickly, effortlessly, and above all, 
quietly. 

Deep in his greasy, smelly bunk, fashioned out of a maintenance 
hatchway, Ford Prefect slept among his towels, dreaming of old 
haunts. He dreamed at one point in his slumbers of New York. 

In his dream he was walking late at night along the East Side, 
beside the river which had become so extravagantly polluted that 
new lifeforms were now emerging from it spontaneously, demanding 
welfare and voting rights. 

One of those now floated past, waving. Ford waved back. 

The thing thrashed to the shore and struggled up the bank. 

"Hi," it said, "I've just been created. I'm completely new to the 
Universe in all respects. Is there anything you can tell me?" 

"Phew," said Ford, a little nonplussed, "I can tell you where some 
bars are, I guess." 



"What about love and happiness. I sense deep needs for things like 
that," it said, waving its tentacles. "Got any leads there?" 

"You can get some like what you require," said Ford, "on Seventh 
Avenue." 

"I instinctively feel," said the creature, urgently, "that I need to be 
beautiful. Am I?" 

"You're pretty direct, aren't you?" 

"No point in mucking about. Am I?" 

"To me?" said Ford. "No. But listen," he added after a moment, 
"most people make out, you know. Are there and like you down 
there?" 

"Search me, buster," said the creature, "as I said, I'm new here. Life 
is entirely strange to me. What's it like?" 

Flere was something that Ford felt he could speak about with 
authority. 

"Life," he said, "is like a grapefruit." 

"Er, how so?" 

"Well, it's sort of orangey-yellow and dimpled on the outside, wet 
and squidgy in the middle. It's got pips inside, too. Oh, and some 
people have half a one for breakfast." 

"Is there anyone else out there I can talk to?" 

"I expect so," said Ford. "Ask a policeman." 

Deep in his bunk. Ford Prefect wriggled and turned on to his other 
side. It wasn't his favourite type of dream because it didn't have 
Eccentrica Gallumbits, the Triple-Breasted Whore of Eroticon VI in it, 
whom many of his dreams did feature. But at least it was a dream. At 
least he was asleep. 



Chapter 24 


Luckily there was a strong updraft in the alley because Arthur 
hadn't done this sort of thing for a while, at least, not deliberately, 
and deliberately is exactly the way you are not meant to do it. 

He swung down sharply, nearly catching himself a nasty crack on 
the jaw with the doorstep and tumbled through the air, so suddenly 
stunned with what a profoundly stupid thing he had just done that he 
completely forgot the bit about hitting the ground and didn't. 

A nice trick, he thought to himself, if you can do it. 

The ground was hanging menacingly above his head. 

He tried not to think about the ground, what an extraordinarily big 
thing it was and how much it would hurt him if it decided to stop 
hanging there and suddenly fell on him. He tried to think nice 
thoughts about lemurs instead, which was exactly the right thing to 
do because he couldn't at that moment remember precisely what a 
lemur was, if it was one of those things that sweep in great majestic 
herds across the plains of wherever it was or if that was wildebeests, 
so it was a tricky kind of thing to think nice thoughts about without 
simply resorting to an icky sort of general well-disposedness towards 
things, and all this kept his mind well occupied while his body tried to 
adjust to the fact that it wasn't touching anything. 

A Mars bar wrapper fluttered down the alleyway. 

After a seeming moment of doubt and indecision it eventually 
allowed the wind to ease it, fluttering, between him and the ground. 

"Arthur..." 

The ground was still hanging menacingly above his head, and he 
thought it was probably time to do something about that, such as fall 
away from it, which is what he did. Slowly. Very, very slowly. 

As he fell slowly, very, very slowly, he closed his eyes - carefully, so 
as not to jolt anything. 

The feel of his eyes closing ran down his whole body. Once it had 
reached his feet, and the whole of his body was alerted to the fact 



that his eyes were now closed and was not panicked by it, he slowly, 
very, very slowly, revolved his body one way and his mind the other. 

That should sort the ground out. 

He could feel the air clear about him now, breezing around him 
quite cheerfully, untroubled by his being there, and slowly, very, very 
slowly, as from a deep and distant sleep, he opened his eyes. 

He had flown before, of course, flown many times on Krikkit until 
all the birdtalk had driven him scatty, but this was different. 

Here he was on his own world, quietly, and without fuss, beyond a 
slight trembling which could have been attributable to a number of 
things, being in the air. 

Ten or fifteen feet below him was the hard tarmac and a few yards 
off to the right the yellow street lights of Upper Street. 

Luckily the alleyway was dark since the light which was supposed 
to see it through the night was on an ingenious timeswitch which 
meant it came on just before lunchtime and went off again as the 
evening was beginning to draw in. He was, therefore, safely shrouded 
in a blanket of dark obscurity. 

He slowly, very, very slowly, lifted his head to Fenchurch, who was 
standing in silent breathless amazement, silhouetted in her upstairs 
doorway. 

Her face was inches from his. 

"I was about to ask you," she said in a low trembly voice, "what you 
were doing. But then I realized that I could see what you were doing. 
You were flying. So it seemed," she went on after a slight wondering 
pause, "like a bit of a silly question." 

Arthur said, "Can you do it?" 

"No." 

"Would you like to try?" 

She bit her lip and shook her head, not so much to say no, but just 
in sheer bewilderment. She was shaking like a leaf. 

"It's quite easy," urged Arthur, "if you don't know how. That's the 
important bit. Be not at all sure how you're doing it." 

Just to demonstrate how easy it was he floated away down the 
alley, fell upwards quite dramatically and bobbed back down to her 
like a banknote on a breath of wind. 



"Ask me how I did that." 

"How... did you do that?" 

"No idea. Not a clue." 

She shrugged in bewilderment. "So how can I...?" 

Arthur bobbed down a little lower and held out his hand. 

"I want you to try," he said, "to step on my hand. Just one foot." 

"What?" 

"Try it." 

Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if she was trying 
to step on the hand of someone who was floating in front of her in 
midair, she stepped on to his hand. 

"Now the other." 

"What?" 

"Take the weight off your back foot." 

"I can't." 

"Try it." 

"Like this?" 

"Like that." 

Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if - She stopped 
telling herself what she was doing was like because she had a feeling 
she didn't altogether want to know. 

She fixed her eyes very firmly on the guttering of the roof of the 
decrepit warehouse opposite which had been annoying her for weeks 
because it was clearly going to fall off and she wondered if anyone 
was going to do anything about it or whether she ought to say 
something to somebody, and didn't think for a moment about the fact 
that she was standing on the hands of someone who wasn't standing 
on anything at all. 

"Now," said Arthur, "take your weight off your left foot." 

She thought that the warehouse belonged to the carpet company 
who had their offices round the corner, and took the weight off her 
left foot, so she should probably go and see them about the gutter. 

"Now," said Arthur, "take the weight off your right foot." 

"I can't." 

"Try." 



She hadn't seen the guttering from quite this angle before, and it 
looked to her now as if as well as the mud and gunge up there might 
also be a bird's nest. If she leaned forward just a little and took her 
weight off her right foot, she could probably see it more clearly. 

Arthur was alarmed to see that someone down in the alley was 
trying to steal her bicycle. He particularly didn't want to get involved 
in an argument at the moment and hoped that the guy would do it 
quietly and not look up. 

He had the quiet shifty look of someone who habitually stole 
bicycles in alleys and habitually didn't expect to find their owners 
hovering several feet above them. He was relaxed by both these 
habits, and went about his job with purpose and concentration, and 
when he found that the bike was unarguably bound by hoops of 
tungsten carbide to an iron bar embedded in concrete, he peacefully 
bent both its wheels and went on his way. 

Arthur let out a long-held breath. 

"See what a piece of eggshell I have found you," said Fenchurch in 
his ear. 



Chapter 25 


Those who are regular followers of the doings of Arthur Dent may 
have received an impression of his character and habits which, while 
it includes the truth and, of course, nothing but the truth, falls 
somewhat short, in its composition, of the whole truth in all its 
glorious aspects. 

And the reasons for this are obvious. Editing, selection, the need to 
balance that which is interesting with that which is relevant and cut 
out all the tedious happenstance. 

Like this for instance. "Arthur Dent went to bed. He went up the 
stairs, all fifteen of them, opened the door, went into his room, took 
off his shoes and socks and then all the rest of his clothes one by one 
and left them in a neatly crumpled heap on the floor. He put on his 
pyjamas, the blue ones with the stripe. He washed his face and hands, 
cleaned his teeth, went to the lavatory, realized that he had once 
again got this all in the wrong order, had to wash his hands again and 
went to bed. He read for fifteen minutes, spending the first ten 
minutes of that trying to work out where in the book he had got to 
the previous night, then he turned out the light and within a minute 
or so more was asleep. 

"It was dark. He lay on his left side for a good hour. 

"After that he moved restlessly in his sleep for a moment and then 
turned over to sleep on his right side. Another hour after this his eyes 
flickered briefly and he slightly scratched his nose, though there was 
still a good twenty minutes to go before he turned back on to his left 
side. And so he whiled the night away, sleeping. 

"At four he got up and went to the lavatory again. He opened the 
door to the lavatory..." and so on. 

It's guff. It doesn't advance the action. It makes for nice fat books 
such as the American market thrives on, but it doesn't actually get 
you anywhere. You don't, in short, want to know. 



But there are other omissions as well, beside the teethcleaning and 
trying to find fresh socks variety, and in some of these people have 
often seemed inordinately interested. 

What, they want to know, about all that stuff off in the wings with 
Arthur and Trillian, did that ever get anywhere? 

To which the answer is, of course, mind your own business. 

And what, they say, was he up to all those nights on the planet 
Krikkit? Just because the planet didn't have Fuolornis Fire Dragons or 
Dire Straits doesn't mean that everyone just sat up every night 
reading. 

Or to take a more specific example, what about the night after the 
committee meeting party on Prehistoric Earth, when Arthur found 
himself sitting on a hillside watching the moon rise over the softly 
burning trees in company with a beautiful young girl called Mella, 
recently escaped from a lifetime of staring every morning at a 
hundred nearly identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of 
toothpaste in the art department of an advertising agency on the 
planet Golgafrincham. What then? What happened next? And the 
answer is, of course, that the book ended. 

The next one didn't resume the story till five years later, and you 
can, claim some, take discretion too far. "This Arthur Dent," comes 
the cry from the furthest reaches of the galaxy, and has even now 
been found inscribed on a mysterious deep space probe thought to 
originate from an alien galaxy at a distance too hideous to 
contemplate, "What is he, man or mouse? Is he interested in nothing 
more than tea and the wider issues of life? Has he no spirit? Has he 
no passion? Does he not, to put it in a nutshell, fuck?" 

Those who wish to know should read on. Others may wish to skip 
on to the last chapter which is a good bit and has Marvin in it. 



Chapter 26 


Arthur Dent allowed himself for an unworthy moment to think, as 
they drifted up, that he very much hoped that his friends who had 
always found him pleasant but dull, or more latterly, odd but dull, 
were having a good time in the pub, but that was the last time, for a 
while, that he thought of them. 

They drifted up, spiralling slowly around each other, like sycamore 
seeds falling from sycamore trees in the autumn, except going the 
other way. 

And as they drifted up their minds sang with the ecstatic 
knowledge that either what they were doing was completely and 
utterly and totally impossible or that physics had a lot of catching up 
to do. 

Physics shook its head and, looking the other way, concentrated on 
keeping the cars going along the Euston Road and out towards the 
Westway flyover, on keeping the streetlights lit and on making sure 
that when somebody on Baker Street dropped a cheeseburger it went 
splat upon the ground. 

Dwindling headily beneath them, the beaded strings of light of 
London - London, Arthur had to keep reminding himself, not the 
strangely coloured fields of Krikkit on the remote fringes of the galaxy, 
lighted freckles of which faintly spanned the opening sky above them, 
but London - swayed, swaying and turning, turned. 

"Try a swoop," he called to Fenchurch. 

"What?" 

Her voice seemed strangely clear but distant in all the vast empty 
air. It was breathy and faint with disbelief - all those things, clear, 
faint, distant, breathy, all at the same time. 

"We're flying..." she said. 

"A trifle," called Arthur, "think nothing of it. Try a swoop." 

"A sw -" 



Her hand caught his, and in a second her weight caught it too, and 
stunningly, she was gone, tumbling beneath him, clawing wildly at 
nothing. 

Physics glanced at Arthur, and clotted with horror he was gone too, 
sick with giddy dropping, every part of him screaming but his voice. 

They plummeted because this was London and you really couldn't 
do this sort of thing here. 

He couldn't catch her because this was London, and not a million 
miles from here, seven hundred and fifty-six, to be exact, in Pisa, 
Galileo had clearly demonstrated that two falling bodies fell at exactly 
the same rate of acceleration irrespective of their relative weights. 

They fell. 

Arthur realized as he fell, giddily and sickeningly, that if he was 
going to hang around in the sky believing everything that the Italians 
had to say about physics when they couldn't even keep a simple 
tower straight, that they were in dead trouble, and damn well did fall 
faster than Fenchurch. 

He grappled her from above, and fumbled for a tight grip on her 
shoulders. He got it. 

Fine. They were now falling together, which was all very sweet and 
romantic, but didn't solve the basic problem, which was that they 
were falling, and the ground wasn't waiting around to see if he had 
any more clever tricks up his sleeve, but was coming up to meet them 
like an express train. 

He couldn't support her weight, he hadn't anything he could 
support it with or against. The only thing he could think was that they 
were obviously going to die, and if he wanted anything other than the 
obvious to happen he was going to have to do something other than 
the obvious. Here he felt he was on familiar territory. 

He let go of her, pushed her away, and when she turned her face to 
him in a gasp of stunned horror, caught her little finger with his little 
finger and swung her back upwards, tumbling clumsily up after her. 

"Shit," she said, as she sat panting and breathless on absolutely 
nothing at all, and when she had recovered herself they fled on up 
into the night. 

Just below cloud level they paused and scanned where they had 
impossibly come. The ground was something not to regard with any 



too firm or steady an eye, but merely to glance at, as it were, in 
passing. 

Fenchurch tried some little swoops, daringly, and found that if she 
judged herself just right against a body of wind she could pull off 
some really quite dazzling ones with a little pirouette at the end, 
followed by a little drop which made her dress billow around her, and 
this is where readers who are keen to know what Marvin and Ford 
Prefect have been up to all this while should look ahead to later 
chapters, because Arthur now could wait no longer and helped her 
take it off. 

It drifted down and away whipped by the wind until it was a speck 
which finally vanished, and for various complicated reasons 
revolutionized the life of a family on Flounslow, over whose washing 
line it was discovered draped in the morning. 

In a mute embrace, they drifted up till they were swimming 
amongst the misty wraiths of moisture that you can see feathering 
around the wings of an aeroplane but never feel because you are 
sitting warm inside the stuffy aeroplane and looking through the little 
scratchy perspex window while somebody else's son tries patiently to 
pour warm milk into your shirt. 

Arthur and Fenchurch could feel them, wispy cold and thin, 
wreathing round their bodies, very cold, very thin. They felt, even 
Fenchurch, now protected from the elements by only a couple of 
fragments from Marks and Spencer, that if they were not going to let 
the force of gravity bother them, then mere cold or paucity of 
atmosphere could go and whistle. 

The two fragments from Marks and Spencer which, as Fenchurch 
rose now into the misty body of the clouds, Arthur removed very, 
very slowly, which is the only way it's possible to do it when you're 
flying and also not using your hands, went on to create considerable 
havoc in the morning in, respectively, counting from top to bottom, 
Isleworth and Richmond. 

They were in the cloud for a long time, because it was stacked very 
high, and when finally they emerged wetly above it, Fenchurch slowly 
spinning like a starfish lapped by a rising tidepool, they found that 
above the clouds is where the night get seriously moonlit. 

The light is darkly brilliant. There are different mountains up there, 
but they are mountains, with their own white arctic snows. 



They had emerged at the top of the high-stacked cumulo-nimbus, 
and now began lazily to drift down its contours, as Fenchurch eased 
Arthur in turn from his clothes, prised him free of them till all were 
gone, winding their surprised way down into the enveloping 
whiteness. 

She kissed him, kissed his neck, his chest, and soon they were 
drifting on, turning slowly, in a kind of speechless T-shape, which 
might have caused even a Fuolornis Fire Dragon, had one flown past, 
replete with pizza, to flap its wings and cough a little. 

There were, however, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons in the clouds nor 
could there be for, like the dinosaurs, the dodos, and the Greater 
Drubbered Wintwock of Stegbartle Major in the constellation Fraz, 
and unlike the Boeing 747 which is in plentiful supply, they are sadly 
extinct, and the Universe shall never know their like again. 

The reason that a Boeing 747 crops up rather unexpectedly in the 
above list is not unconnected with the fact that something very 
similar happened in the lives of Arthur and Fenchurch a moment or 
two later. 

They are big things, terrifyingly big. You know when one is in the air 
with you. There is a thunderous attack of air, a moving wall of 
screaming wind, and you get tossed aside, if you are foolish enough to 
be doing anything remotely like what Arthur and Fenchurch were 
doing in its close vicinity, like butterflies in the Blitz. 

This time, however, there was a heart-sickening fall or loss of nerve, 
a re-grouping moments later and a wonderful new idea 
enthusiastically signalled through the buffeting noise. 

Mr.s E. Kapelsen of Boston, Massachusetts was an elderly lady, 
indeed, she felt her life was nearly at an end. She had seen a lot of it, 
been puzzled by some, but, she was a little uneasy to feel at this late 
stage, bored by too much. It had all been very pleasant, but perhaps a 
little too explicable, a little too routine. 

With a sigh she flipped up the little plastic window shutter and 
looked out over the wing. 

At first she thought she ought to call the stewardess, but then she 
thought no, damn it, definitely not, this was for her, and her alone. 

By the time her two inexplicable people finally slipped back off the 
wing and tumbled into the slipstream she had cheered up an awful lot. 



She was mostly immensely relieved to think that virtually 
everything that anybody had ever told her was wrong. 

The following morning Arthur and Fenchurch slept very late in the 
alley despite the continual wail of furniture being restored. 

The following night they did it all over again, only this time with 
Sony Walkmen. 



Chapter 27 


"This is all very wonderful," said Fenchurch a few days later. "But I 
do need to know what has happened to me. You see, there's this 
difference between us. That you lost something and found it again, 
and I found something and lost it. I need to find it again." 

She had to go out for the day, so Arthur settled down for a day of 
telephoning. 

Murray Bost Henson was a journalist on one of the papers with 
small pages and big print. It would be pleasant to be able to say that 
he was none the worse for it, but sadly, this was not the case. He 
happened to be the only journalist that Arthur knew, so Arthur 
phoned him anyway. 

"Arthur my old soup spoon, my old silver turreen, how particularly 
stunning to hear from you. Someone told me you'd gone off into 
space or something." 

Murray had his own special kind of conversation language which he 
had invented for his own use, and which no one else was able to 
speak or even to follow. Hardly any of it meant anything at all. The 
bits which did mean anything were often so wonderfully buried that 
no one could ever spot them slipping past in the avalance of nonsense. 
The time when you did find out, later, which bits he did mean, was 
often a bad time for all concerned. 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"Just a rumour my old elephant tusk, my little green baize card 
table, just a rumour. Probably means nothing at all, but I may need a 
quote from you." 

"Nothing to say, just pub talk." 

"We thrive on it, my old prosthetic limb, we thrive on it. Plus it 
would fit like a whatsit in one of those other things with the other 
stories of the week, so it could be just to have you denying it. Excuse 
me, something has just fallen out of my ear." 



There was a slight pause, at the end of which Murray Bost Henson 
came back on the line sounding genuinely shaken. 

"Just remembered," he said, "what an odd evening I had last night. 
Anyway my old, I won't say what, how do you feel about having 
ridden on Halley's Comet?" 

"I haven't," said Arthur with a suppressed sigh, "ridden on Halley's 
Comet." 

"OK, How do you feel about not having ridden on Halley's Comet?" 

"Pretty relaxed, Murray." 

There was a pause while Murray wrote this down. 

"Good enough for me, Arthur, good enough for Ethel and me and 
the chickens. Fits in with the general weirdness of the week. Week of 
the Weirdos, we're thinking of calling it. Good, eh?" 

"Very good." 

"Got a ring to it. First we have this man it always rains on." 

"What?" 

"It's the absolute stocking top truth. All documented in his little 
black book, it all checks out at every single funloving level. The Met 
Office is going ice cold thick banana whips, and funny little men in 
white coats are flying in from all over the world with their little rulers 
and boxes and drip feeds. This man is the bee's knees, Arthur, he is 
the wasp's nipples. He is, I would go so far as to say, the entire set of 
erogenous zones of every major flying insect of the Western world. 
We're calling him the Rain God. Nice, eh?" 

"I think I've met him." 

"Good ring to it. What did you say?" 

"I may have met him. Complains all the time, yes?" 

"Incredible! You met the Rain God?" 

"If it's the same guy. I told him to stop complaining and show 
someone his book." 

There was an impressed pause from Murray Bost Henson's end of 
the phone. 

"Well, you did a bundle. An absolute bundle has absolutely been 
done by you. Listen, do you know how much a tour operator is paying 
that guy not to go to Malaga this year? I mean forget irrigating the 
Sahara and boring stuff like that, this guy has a whole new career 



ahead of him, just avoiding places for money. The man's turning into a 
monster, Arthur, we might even have to make him win the bingo. 

"Listen, we may want to do a feature on you, Arthur, the Man Who 
Made the Rain God Rain. Got a ring to it, eh?" 

"A nice one, but..." 

"We may need to photograph you under a garden shower, but 
that'll be OK. Where are you?" 

"Er, I'm in Islington. Listen, Murray..." 

"Islington!" 

"Yes..." 

"Well, what about the real weirdness of the week, the real 
seriously loopy stuff. You know anything about these flying people?" 

"No." 

"You must have. This is the real seethingly crazy one. This is the 
real meatballs in the batter. Locals are phoning in all the time to say 
there's this couple who go flying nights. We've got guys down in our 
photo labs working through the night to put together a genuine 
photograph. You must have heard." 

"No." 

"Arthur, where have you been? Oh, space, right, I got your quote. 
But that was months ago. Listen, it's night after night this week, my 
old cheesegrater, right on your patch. This couple just fly around the 
sky and start doing all kinds of stuff. And I don't mean looking through 
walls or pretending to be box girder bridges. You don't know 
anything?" 

"No." 

"Arthur, it's been almost inexpressibly delicious conversing with 
you, chumbum, but I have to go. I'll send the guy with the camera and 
the hose. Give me the address, I'm ready and writing." 

"Listen, Murray, I called to ask you something." 

"I have a lot to do." 

"I just wanted to find out something about the dolphins." 

"No story. Last year's news. Forget 'em. They're gone." 

"It's important." 

"Listen, no one will touch it. You can't sustain a story, you know, 
when the only news is the continuing absence of whatever the story's 



about. Not our territory anyway, try the Sundays. Maybe they'll run a 
little 'Whatever Happened to "Whatever Happened to the Dolphins'" 
story in a couple of years, around August. But what's anybody going 
to do now? 'Dolphins still gone'? 'Continuing Dolphin Absence'? 
'Dolphins - Further Days Without Them'? The story dies, Arthur. It lies 
down and kicks its little feet in the air and presently goes to the great 
golden spike in the sky, my old fruitbat." 

"Murray, I'm not interested in whether it's a story. I just want to 
find out how I can get in touch with that guy in California who claims 
to know something about it. I thought you might know." 



Chapter 28 


"People are beginning to talk," said Fenchurch that evening, after 
they had hauled her 'cello in. 

"Not only talk," said Arthur, "but print, in big bold letters under the 
bingo prizes. Which is why I thought I'd better get these." 

He showed her the long narrow booklets of airline tickets. 

"Arthur!" she said, hugging him. "Does that mean you managed to 
talk to him?" 

"I have had a day," said Arthur, "of extreme telephonic exhaustion. 

I have spoken to virtually every department of virtually every paper in 
Fleet street, and I finally tracked his number down." 

"You've obviously been working hard, you're drenched with sweat 
poor darling." 

"Not with sweat," said Arthur wearily. "A photographer's just been. 

I tried to argue, but - never mind, the point is, yes." 

"You spoke to him." 

"I spoke to his wife. She said he was too weird to come to the 
phone right now and could I call back." 

He sat down heavily, realized he was missing something and went 
to the fridge to find it. 

"Want a drink?" 

"Would commit murder to get one. I always know I'm in for a tough 
time when my 'cello teacher looks me up and down and says, 'Ah yes, 
my dear, I think a little Tchaikovsky today.'." 

"I called again," said Arthur, "and she said that he was 3.2 light 
years from the phone and I should call back." 

"Ah." 

"I called again. "She said the situation had improved. He was now a 
mere 2.6 light years from the phone but it was still a long way to 
shout." 



"You don't suppose," said Fenchurch, doubtfully, "that there's 
anyone else we can talk to?" 

"It gets worse," said Arthur, "I spoke to someone on a science 
magazine who actually knows him, and he said that John Watson will 
not only believe, but will actually have absolute proof, often dictated 
to him by angels with golden beards and green wings and Doctor 
Scholl footwear, that the month's most fashionable silly theory is true. 
For people who question the validity of these visions he will 
triumphantly produce the clogs in question, and that's as far as you 
get." 

"I didn't realize it was that bad," said Fenchurch quietly. She fiddled 
listlessly with the tickets. 

"I phoned Mrs. Watson again," said Arthur. "Fler name, by the way, 
and you may wish to know this, is Arcane Jill." 

"I see." 

"I'm glad you see. I thought you mightn't believe any of this, so 
when I called her this time I used the telephone answering machine to 
record the call." 

Fie went across to the telephone machine and fiddled and fumed 
with all its buttons for a while, because it was the one which was 
particularly recommended by Which magazine and is almost 
impossible to use without going mad. 

"Flere it is," he said at last, wiping the sweat from his brow. 

The voice was thin and crackly with its journey to a geostationary 
satellite and back, but it was also hauntingly calm. 

"Perhaps I should explain," Arcane Jill Watson's voice said, "that 
the phone is in fact in a room that he never comes into. It's in the 
Asylum you see. Wonko the Sane does not like to enter the Asylum 
and so he does not. I feel you should know this because it may save 
you phoning. If you would like to meet him, this is very easily 
arranged. All you have to do is walk in. Fie will only meet people 
outside the Asylum." 

Arthur's voice, at its most mystified: "I'm sorry, I don't understand. 
Where is the asylum?" 

"Where is the Asylum?" Arcane Jill Watson again. "Flave you ever 
read the instructions on a packet of toothpicks?" 

On the tape, Arthur's voice had to admit that he had not. 



"You may want to do that. You may find that it clarifies things for 
you a little. You may find that it indicates to you where the Asylum is. 
Thank you." 

The sound of the phone line went dead. Arthur turned the machine 
off. 

"Well, I suppose we can regard that as an invitation," he said with a 
shrug. "I actually managed to get the address from the guy on the 
science magazine." 

Fenchurch looked up at him again with a thoughtful frown, and 
looked at the tickets again. 

"Do you think it's worth it?" she said. 

"Well," said Arthur, "the one thing that everyone I spoke to agrees 
on, apart from the fact that they all thought he was barking mad, is 
that he does know more than any man living about dolphins." 



Chapter 29 


"This is an important announcement. This is flight 121 to Los 
Angeles. If your travel plans today do not include Los Angeles, now 
would be the perfect time to disembark." 



Chapter 30 


They rented a car in Los Angeles from one of the places that rents 
out cars that other people have thrown away. 

"Getting it to go round corners is a bit of a problem," said the guy 
behind the sunglasses as he handed them the keys, "sometimes it's 
simpler just to get out and find a car that's going in that direction." 

They stayed for one night in a hotel on Sunset Boulevard which 
someone had told them they would enjoy being puzzled by. 

"Everyone there is either English or odd or both. They've got a 
swimming pool where you can go and watch English rock stars 
reading Language, Truth and Logic for the photographers." 

It was true. There was one and that was exactly what he was doing. 

The garage attendant didn't think much of their car, but that was 
fine because they didn't either. 

Late in the evening they drove through the Hollywood hills along 
Mulholland Drive and stopped to look out first over the dazzling sea 
of floating light that is Los Angeles, and later stopped to look across 
the dazzling sea of floating light that is the San Fernando Valley. They 
agreed that the sense of dazzle stopped immediately at the back of 
their eyes and didn't touch any other part of them and came away 
strangely unsatisfied by the spectacle. As dramatic seas of light went, 
it was fine, but light is meant to illuminate something, and having 
driven through what this particularly dramatic sea of light was 
illuminating they didn't think much of it. 

They slept late and restlessly and awoke at lunchtime when it was 
stupidly hot. 

They drove out along the freeway to Santa Monica for their first 
look at the Pacific Ocean, the ocean which Wonko the Sane spent all 
his days and a good deal of his nights looking at. 

"Someone told me," said Fenchurch, "that they once overheard 
two old ladies on this beach, doing what we're doing, looking at the 
Pacific Ocean for the first time in their lives. And apparently, after a 



long pause, one of them said to the other, 'You know, it's not as big as 
I expected."' 

Their mood lifted further as the sun began to move down the 
western half of the sky, and by the time they were back in their 
rattling car and driving towards a sunset that no one of any sensibility 
would dream of building a city like Los Angeles on front of, they were 
suddenly feeling astonishingly and irrationally happy and didn't even 
mind that the terrible old car radio would only play two stations, and 
those simultaneously. So what, they were both playing good rock and 
roll. 

"I know he will be able to help us," said Fenchurch determinedly. "I 
know he will. What's his name again, that he likes to be called?" 

"Wonko the Sane." 

"I know that he will be able to help us." 

Arthur wondered if he would and hoped that he would, and hoped 
that what Fenchurch had lost could be found here, on this Earth, 
whatever this Earth might prove to be. 

He hoped, as he had hoped continually and fervently since the time 
they had talked together on the banks of the Serpentine, that he 
would not be called upon to try to remember something that he had 
very firmly and deliberately buried in the furthest recesses of his 
memory, where he hoped it would cease to nag at him. 

In Santa Barbara they stopped at a fish restaurant in what seemed 
to be a converted warehouse. 

Fenchurch had red mullet and said it was delicious. 

Arthur had a swordfish steak and said it made him angry. 

He grabbed a passing waitress by the arm and berated her. 

"Why's this fish so bloody good?" he demanded, angrily. 

"Please excuse my friend," said Fenchurch to the startled waitress. 
"I think he's having a nice day at last." 



Chapter 31 


If you took a couple of David Bowies and stuck one of the David 
Bowies on the top of the other David Bowie, then attached another 
David Bowie to the end of each of the arms of the upper of the first 
two David Bowies and wrapped the whole business up in a dirty 
beach robe you would then have something which didn't exactly look 
like John Watson, but which those who knew him would find 
hauntingly familiar. 

He was tall and he gangled. 

When he sat in his deckchair gazing at the Pacific, not so much with 
any kind of wild surmise any longer as with a peaceful deep dejection, 
it was a little difficult to tell exactly where the deckchair ended and he 
began, and you would hesitate to put your hand on, say, his forearm 
in case the whole structure suddenly collapsed with a snap and took 
your thumb off. 

But his smile when he turned it on you was quite remarkable. It 
seemed to be composed of all the worst things that life can do to you, 
but which, when he briefly reassembled them in that particular order 
on his face, made you suddenly fee, "Oh. Well that's all right then." 

When he spoke, you were glad that he used the smile that made 
you feel like that pretty often. 

"Oh yes," he said, "they come and see me. They sit right here. They 
sit right where you're sitting." 

He was talking of the angels with the golden beards and green 
wings and Dr. Scholl sandals. 

"They eat nachos which they say they can't get where they come 
from. They do a lot of coke and are very wonderful about a whole 
range of things." 

"Do they?" said Arthur. "Are they? So, er... when is this then? 

When do they come?" 

He gazed out at the Pacific as well. There were little sandpipers 
running along the margin of the shore which seemed to have this 



problem: they needed to find their food in the sand which a wave had 
just washed over, but they couldn't bear to get their feet wet. To deal 
with this problem they ran with an odd kind of movement as if they'd 
been constructed by somebody very clever in Switzerland. 

Fenchurch was sitting on the sand, idly drawing patterns in it with 
her fingers. 

"Weekends, mostly," said Wonko the Sane, "on little scooters. They 
are great machines." He smiled. 

"I see," said Arthur. "I see." 

A tiny cough from Fenchurch attracted his attention and he looked 
round at her. She had scratched a little stick figure drawing in the 
sand of the two of them in the clouds. For a moment he thought she 
was trying to get him excited, then he realized that she was rebuking 
him. "Who are we," she was saying, "to say he's mad?" 

His house was certainly peculiar, and since this was the first thing 
that Fenchurch and Arthur had encountered it would help to know 
what it was like. 

What it was like was this: 

It was inside out. 

Actually inside out, to the extent that they had to park on the 
carpet. 

All along what one would normally call the outer wall, which was 
decorated in a tasteful interior-designed pink, were bookshelves, also 
a couple of those odd three-legged tables with semi-circular tops 
which stand in such a way as to suggest that someone just dropped 
the wall straight through them, and pictures which were clearly 
designed to soothe. 

Where it got really odd was the roof. 

It folded back on itself like something that Maurits C. Escher, had 
he been given to hard nights on the town, which is no part of this 
narrative's purpose to suggest was the case, though it is sometimes 
hard, looking at his pictures, particularly the one with the awkward 
steps, not to wonder, might have dreamed up after having been on 
one, for the little chandeliers which should have been hanging inside 
were on the outside pointing up. 

Confusing. 



The sign above the front door said, "Come Outside", and so, 
nervously, they had. 

Inside, of course, was where the Outside was. Rough brickwork, 
nicely done painting, guttering in good repair, a garden path, a couple 
of small trees, some rooms leading off. 

And the inner walls stretched down, folded curiously, and opened 
at the end as if, by an optical illusion which would have had Maurits C. 
Escher frowning and wondering how it was done, to enclose the 
Pacific Ocean itself. 

"Hello," said John Watson, Wonko the Sane. 

Good, they thought to themselves, "Hello" is something we can 
cope with. 

"Hello," they said, and all surprisingly was smiles. 

For quite a while he seemed curiously reluctant to talk about the 
dolphins, looking oddly distracted and saying, "I forget..." whenever 
they were mentioned, and had shown them quite proudly round the 
eccentricities of his house. 

"It gives me pleasure," he said, "in a curious kind of way, and does 
nobody any harm," he continued, "that a competent optician couldn't 
correct." 

They liked him. He had an open, engaging quality and seemed able 
to mock himself before anybody else did. 

"Your wife," said Arthur, looking around, "mentioned some 
toothpicks." He said it with a hunted look, as if he was worried that 
she might suddenly leap out from behind the door and mention them 
again. 

Wonko the Sane laughed. It was a light easy laugh, and sounded 
like one he had used a lot before and was happy with. 

"Ah yes," he said, "that's to so with the day I finally realized that 
the world had gone totally mad and built the Asylum to put it in, poor 
thing, and hoped it would get better." 

This was the point at which Arthur began to feel a little nervous 
again. 

"Here," said Wonko the Sane, "we are outside the Asylum." He 
pointed again at the rough brickwork, the pointing and the guttering. 
"Go through that door," he pointed at the first door through which 
they had originally entered, "and you go into the Asylum. I've tried to 



decorate it nicely to keep the inmates happy, but there's very little 
one can do. I never go in there now myself. If ever I am tempted, 
which these days I rarely am, I simply look at the sign written over the 
door and shy away." 

"That one?" said Fenchurch, pointing, rather puzzled, at a blue 
plaque with some instructions written on it. 

"Yes. They are the words that finally turned me into the hermit I 
have now become. It was quite sudden. I saw them, and I knew what I 
had to do." 

The sign said: 

Hold stick near centre of its length. Moisten pointed end in mouth. 
Insert in tooth space, blunt end next to gum. Use gentle in-out motion. 

"It seemed to me," said Wonko the sane, "that any civilization that 
had so far lost its head as to need to include a set of detailed 
instructions for use in a packet of toothpicks, was no longer a 
civilization in which I could live and stay sane." 

He gazed out at the Pacific again, as if daring it to rave and gibber 
at him, but it lay there calmly and played with the sandpipers. 

"And in case it crossed your mind to wonder, as I can see how it 
possibly might, I am completely sane. Which is why I call myself 
Wonko the Sane, just to reassure people on this point. Wonko is what 
my mother called me when I was a kid and clumsy and knocked things 
over, and sane is what I am, and how," he added, with one of his 
smiles that made you feel, "Oh. Well that's all right then." "I intend to 
remain. Shall we go on to the beach and see what we have to talk 
about?" 

They went out on to the beach, which was where he started talking 
about angels with golden beards and green wings and Dr. Scholl 
sandals. 

"About the dolphins..." said Fenchurch gently, hopefully. 

"I can show you the sandals," said Wonko the Sane. 

"I wonder, do you know..." 

"Would you like me to show you," said Wonko the Sane, "the 
sandals? I have them. I'll get them. They are made by the Dr. Scholl 
company, and the angels say that they particularly suit the terrain 
they have to work in. They say they run a concession stand by the 



message. When I say I don't know what that means they say no, you 
don't, and laugh. Well, I'll get them anyway." 

As he walked back towards the inside, or the outside depending on 
how you looked at it, Arthur and Fenchurch looked at each other in a 
wondering and slightly desperate sort of way, then each shrugged and 
idly drew figures in the sand. 

"How are the feet today?" said Arthur quietly. 

"OK. It doesn't feel so odd in the sand. Or in the water. The water 
touches them perfectly. I just think this isn't our world." 

She shrugged. 

"What do you think he meant," she said, "by the message?" 

"I don't know," said Arthur, though the memory of a man called 
Prak who laughed at him continuously kept nagging at him. 

When Wonko returned he was carrying something that stunned 
Arthur. Not the sandals, they were perfectly ordinary wooden- 
bottomed sandals. 

"I just thought you'd like to see," he said, "what angels wear on 
their feet. Just out of curiousity. I'm not trying to prove anything, by 
the way. I'm a scientist and I know what constitutes proof. But the 
reason I call myself by my childhood name is to remind myself that a 
scientist must also be absolutely like a child. If he sees a thing, he 
must say that he sees it, whether it was what he thought he was 
going to see or not. See first, think later, then test. But always see first. 
Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting. Most scientists 
forget that. I'll show you something to demonstrate that later. So, the 
other reason I call myself Wonko the Sane is so that people will think I 
am a fool. That allows me to say what I see when I see it. You can't 
possibly be a scientist if you mind people thinking that you're a fool. 
Anyway, I also thought you might like to see this." 

This was the thing that Arthur had been stunned to see him 
carrying, for it was a wonderful silver-grey glass fish bowl, seemingly 
identical to the one in Arthur's bedroom. 

Arthur had been trying for some thirty seconds now, without 
success, to say, "Where did you get that?" sharply, and with a gasp in 
his voice. 

Finally his time had come, but he missed it by a millisecond. 



"Where did you get that?" said Fenchurch, sharply and with a gasp 
in her voice. 

Arthur glanced at Fenchurch sharply and with a gasp in his voice 
said, "What? Flave you seen one of these before?" 

"Yes," she said, "I've got one. Or at least I did have. Russell nicked it 
to put his golfballs in. I don't know where it came from, just that I was 
angry with Russell for nicking it. Why, have you got one?" 

"Yes, it was..." 

They both became aware that Wonko the Sane was glancing 
sharply backwards and forwards between them, and trying to get a 
gasp in edgeways. 

"You have one of those too?" he said to both of them. 

"Yes." They both said it. 

Fie looked long and calmly at each of them, then he held up the 
bowl to catch the light of the Californian sun. 

The bowl seemed almost to sing with the sun, to chime with the 
intensity of its light, and cast darkly brilliant rainbows around the 
sand and upon them. Fie turned it, and turned it. They could see quite 
clearly in the fine tracery of its etchwork the words "So Long, and 
Thanks For All The Fish." 

"Do you know," asked Wonko quietly, "what it is?" 

They each shook their heads slowly, and with wonder, almost 
hypnotized by the flashing of the lightning shadows in the grey glass. 

"It is a farewell gift from the dolphins," said Wonko in a low quiet 
voice, "the dolphins whom I loved and studied, and swam with, and 
fed with fish, and even tried to learn their language, a task which they 
seemed to make impossibly difficult, considering the fact that I now 
realize they were perfectly capable of communicating in ours if they 
decided they wanted to." 

Fie shook his head with a slow, slow smile, and then looked again 
at Fenchurch, and then at Arthur. 

"Flave you..." he said to Arthur, "what have you done with yours? 
May I ask you that?" 

"Er, I keep a fish in it," said Arthur, slightly embarrassed. "I 
happened to have this fish I was wondering what to do with, and, er, 
there was this bowl." Fie tailed off. 



"You've done nothing else? No," he said, "if you had, you would 
know." He shook his head again. 

"My wife kept wheatgerm in ours," resumed Wonko, with some 
new tone in his voice, "until last night..." 

"What," said Arthur slowly and hushedly, "happened last night?" 

"We ran out of wheatgerm," said Wonko, evenly. "My wife," he 
added, "has gone to get some more." He seemed lost with his own 
thoughts for a moment. 

"And what happened then?" said Fenchurch, in the same 
breathless tone. 

"I washed it," said Wonko. "I washed it very carefully, very very 
carefully, removing every last speck of wheatgerm, then I dried it 
slowly with a lint-free cloth, slowly, carefully, turning it over and over. 
Then I held it to my ear. Have you... have you held one to your ear?" 

They both shook their heads, again slowly, again dumbly. 

"Perhaps," he said, "you should." 



Chapter 32 


The deep roar of the ocean. 

The break of waves on further shores than thought can find. 

The silent thunders of the deep. 

And from among it, voices calling, and yet not voices, humming 
trillings, wordlings, the half-articulated songs of thought. 

Greetings, waves of greetings, sliding back down into the 
inarticulate, words breaking together. 

A crash of sorrow on the shores of Earth. 

Waves of joy on - where? A world indescribably found, 
indescribably arrived at, indescribably wet, a song of water. 

A fugue of voices now, clamouring explanations, of a disaster 
unavertable, a world to be destroyed, a surge of helplessness, a 
spasm of despair, a dying fall, again the break of words. 

And then the fling of hope, the finding of a shadow Earth in the 
implications of enfolded time, submerged dimensions, the pull of 
parallels, the deep pull, the spin of will, the hurl and split of it, the 
flight. A new Earth pulled into replacement, the dolphins gone. 

Then stunningly a single voice, quite clear. 

"This bowl was brought to you by the Campaign to Save the 
Humans. We bid you farewell." 

And then the sound of long, heavy, perfectly grey bodies rolling 
away into an unknown fathomless deep, quietly giggling. 



Chapter 33 


That night they stayed Outside the Asylum and watched TV from 
inside it. 

"This is what I wanted you to see," said Wonko the Sane when the 
news came around again, "an old colleague of mine. He's over in your 
country running an investigation. Just watch." 

It was a press conference. 

"I'm afraid I can't comment on the name Rain God at this present 
time, and we are calling him an example of a Spontaneous Para- 
Causal Meteorological Phenomenon." 

"Can you tell us what that means?" 

"I'm not altogether sure. Let's be straight here. If we find 
something we can't understand we like to call it something you can't 
understand, or indeed pronounce. I mean if we just let you go around 
calling him a Rain God, then that suggests that you know something 
we don't, and I'm afraid we couldn't have that. 

"No, first we have to call it something which says it's ours, not 
yours, then we set about finding some way of proving it's not what 
you said it is, but something we say it is. 

"And if it turns out that you're right, you'll still be wrong, because 
we will simply call him a... er 'Supernormal...' - not paranormal or 
supernatural because you think you know what those mean now, no, 
a 'Supernormal Incremental Precipitation Inducer'. We'll probably 
want to shove a 'Quasi' in there somewhere to protect ourselves. Rain 
God! Huh, never heard such nonsense in my life. Admittedly, you 
wouldn't catch me going on holiday with him. Thanks, that'll be all for 
now, other than to say 'Hi!' to Wonko if he's watching." 



Chapter 34 


On the way home there was a woman sitting next to them on the 
plane who was looking at them rather oddly. 

They talked quietly to themselves. 

"I still have to know," said Fenchurch, "and I strongly feel that you 
know something that you're not telling me." 

Arthur sighed and took out a piece of paper. 

"Do you have a pencil?" he said. She dug around and found one. 

"What are you doing, sweetheart?" she said, after he had spent 
twenty minutes frowning, chewing the pencil, scribbling on the paper, 
crossing things out, scribbling again, chewing the pencil again and 
grunting irritably to himself. 

"Trying to remember an address someone once gave me." 

"Your life would be an awful lot simpler," she said, "if you bought 
yourself an address book." 

Finally he passed the paper to her. 

"You look after it," he said. 

She looked at it. Among all the scratchings and crossings out were 
the words "Quentulus Quazgar Mountains. Sevorbeupstry. Planet of 
Preliumtarn. Sun-Zarss. Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma." 

"And what's there?" 

"Apparently," said Arthur, "it's God's Final Message to His 
Creation." 

"That sounds a bit more like it," said Fenchurch. "Flow do we get 
there?" 

"You really...?" 

"Yes," said Fenchurch firmly, "I really want to know." 

Arthur looked out of the scratchy little perspex window at the open 
sky outside. 



"Excuse me," said the woman who had been looking at them rather 
oddly, suddenly, "I hope you don't think I'm rude. I get so bored on 
these long flights, it's nice to talk to somebody. My name's Enid 
Kapelsen, I'm from Boston. Tell me, do you fly a lot?" 



Chapter 35 


They went to Arthur's house in the West Country, shoved a couple 
of towels and stuff in a bag, and then sat down to do what every 
Galactic hitch hiker ends up spending most of his time doing. 

They waited for a flying saucer to come by. 

"Friend of mine did this for fifteen years," said Arthur one night as 
they sat forlornly watching the sky. 

"Who was that?" 

"Called Ford Prefect." 

Fie caught himself doing something he had never really expected to 
do again. 

Fie wondered where Ford Prefect was. 

By an extraordinary coincidence, the following day there were two 
reports in the paper, one concerning the most astonishing incidents 
with a flying saucer, and the other about a series of unseemly riots in 
pubs. 

Ford Prefect turned up the day after that looking hung over and 
complaining that Arthur never answered the phone. 

In fact he looked extremely ill, not merely as if he'd been pulled 
through a hedge backwards, but as if the hedge was being 
simultaneously pulled backwards through a combine harvester. Fie 
staggered into Arthur's sitting room, waving aside all offers of support, 
which was an error, because the effort caused him to lose his balance 
altogether and Arthur had eventually to drag him to the sofa. 

"Thank you," said Ford, "thank you very much. Flave you..." he said, 
and fell asleep for three hours. 

"... the faintest idea" he continued suddenly, when he revived, 

"how hard it is to tap into the British phone system from the Pleiades? 
I can see that you haven't, so I'll tell you," he said, "over the very large 
mug of black coffee that you are about to make me." 

Fie followed Arthur wobbily into the kitchen. 



"Stupid operators keep asking you where you're calling from and 
you try and tell them Letchworth and they say you couldn't be if 
you're coming in on that circuit. What are you doing?" 

"Making you some black coffee." 

"Oh." Ford seemed oddly disappointed. He looked about the place 
forlornly. 

"What's this?" he said. 

"Rice Crispies." 

"And this?" 

"Paprika." 

"I see," said Ford, solemnly, and put the two items back down, one 
on top of the other, but that didn't seem to balance properly, so he 
put the other on top of the one and that seemed to work. 

"A little space-lagged," he said. "What was I saying?" 

"About not phoning from Letchworth." 

"I wasn't. I explained this to the lady. 'Bugger Letchworth,' I said, 'if 
that's your attitude. I am in fact calling from a sales scoutship of the 
Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, currently on the sub-light-speed leg of 
a journey between the stars known on your world, though not 
necessarily to you, dear lady.' - I said 'dear lady'," explained Ford 
Prefect, "because I didn't want her to be offended by my implication 
that she was an ignorant cretin..." 

"Tactful," said Arthur Dent. 

"Exactly," said Ford, "tactful." 

He frowned. 

"Space-lag," he said, "is very bad for sub-clauses. You'll have to 
assist me again," he continued, "by reminding me what I was talking 
about." 

"'Between the stars,"' said Arthur, "'known on your world, though 
not necessarily to you, dear lady, as...'" 

"'Pleiades Epsilon and Pleiades Zeta,"' concluded Ford triumphantly. 
"This conversation lark is quite gas isn't it?" 

"Have some coffee." 

"Thank you, no. 'And the reason,' I said, 'why I am bothering you 
with it rather than just dialling direct as I could, because we have 
some pretty sophisticated telecommunications equipment out here in 



the Pleiades, I can tell you, is that the penny pinching son of a 
starbeast piloting this son of a starbeast spaceship insists that I call 
collect. Can you believe that?"' 

"And could she?" 

"I don't know. She had hung up," said Ford, "by this time. So! What 
do you suppose," he asked fiercely, "I did next?" 

"I've no idea, Ford," said Arthur. 

"Pity," said Ford, "I was hoping you could remind me. I really hate 
those guys you know. They really are the creeps of the cosmos, 
buzzing around the celestial infinite with their junky little machines 
that never work properly or, when they do, perform functions that no 
sane man would require of them and," he added savagely, "go beep 
to tell you when they've done it!" 

This was perfectly true, and a very respectable view widely held by 
right thinking people, who are largely recognizable as being right 
thinking people by the mere fact that they hold this view. 

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in a moment of reasoned 
lucidity which is almost unique among its current tally of five million, 
nine hundred and seventy-five thousand, five hundred and nine pages, 
says of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation product that "it is very easy 
to be blinded to the essential uselessness of them by the sense of 
achievement you get from getting them to work at all. 

"In other words - and this is the rock solid principle on which the 
whole of the Corporation's Galaxy-wide success is founded - their 
fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial 
design flaws." 

"And this guy," ranted Ford, "was on a drive to sell more of them! 

His five-year mission to seek out and explore strange new worlds, and 
sell Advanced Music Substitute Systems to their restaurants, elevators 
and wine bars! Or if they didn't have restaurants, elevators and wine 
bars yet, to artificially accelerate their civilization growth until they 
bloody well did have! Where's that coffee!" 

"I threw it away." 

"Make some more. I have now remembered what I did next. I 
saved civilization as we know it. I knew it was something like that." 



He stumbled determinedly back into the sitting room, where he 
seemed to carry on talking to himself, tripping over the furniture and 
making beep beep noises. 

A couple of minutes later, wearing his very placid face, Arthur 
followed him. 

Ford looked stunned. 

"Where have you been?" he demanded. 

"Making some coffee," said Arthur, still wearing his very placid face. 
He had long ago realized that the only way of being in Ford's company 
successfully was to keep a large stock of very placid faces and wear 
them at all times. 

"You missed the best bit!" raged Ford. "You missed the bit where I 
jumped the guy! Now," he said, "I shall have to jump him, all over 
him!" 

He hurled himself recklessly at a chair and broke it. 

"It was better," he said sullenly, "last time," and waved vaguely in 
the direction of another broken chair which he had already got 
trussed up on the dining table. 

"I see," said Arthur, casting a placid eye over the trussed up 
wreckage, "and, er, what are all the ice cubes for?" 

"What?" screamed Ford. "What? You missed that bit too? That's 
the suspended animation facility! I put the guy in the suspended 
animation facility. Well I had to didn't I?" 

"So it would seem," said Arthur, in his placid voice. 

"Don't touch that!!!" yelled Ford. 

Arthur, who was about to replace the phone, which was for some 
mysterious reason lying on the table, off the hook, paused, placidly. 

"OK," said Ford, calming down, "listen to it." 

Arthur put the phone to his ear. 

"It's the speaking clock," he said. 

"Beep, beep, beep," said Ford, "is exactly what is being heard all 
over that guy's ship, while he sleeps, in the ice, going slowly round a 
little-known moon of Sesefras Magna. The London Speaking Clock!" 

"I see," said Arthur again, and decided that now was the time to 
ask the big one. 


"Why?" he said, placidly. 



"With a bit of luck," said Ford, "the phone bill will bankrupt the 
buggers." 

He threw himself, sweating, on to the sofa. 

"Anyway," he said, "dramatic arrival don't you think?" 



Chapter 36 


The flying saucer in which Ford Prefect had stowed away had 
stunned the world. 

Finally there was no doubt, no possibility of mistake, no 
hallucinations, no mysterious CIA agents found floating in reservoirs. 

This time it was real, it was definite. It was quite definitely definite. 

It had come down with a wonderful disregard for anything beneath 
it and crushed a large area of some of the most expensive real estate 
in the world, including much of Flarrods. 

The thing was massive, nearly a mile across, some said, dull silver in 
colour, pitted, scorched and disfigured with the scars of unnumbered 
vicious space battles fought with savage forces by the light of suns 
unknown to man. 

A hatchway opened, crashed down through the Flarrods Food Flails, 
demolished Flarvey Nicholls, and with a final grinding scream of 
tortured architecture, toppled the Sheraton Park Tower. 

After a long, heart-stopping moment of internal crashes and 
grumbles of rending machinery, there marched from it, down the 
ramp, an immense silver robot, a hundred feet tall. 

It held up a hand. 

"I come in peace," it said, adding after a long moment of further 
grinding, "take me to your Lizard." 

Ford Prefect, of course, had an explanation for this, as he sat with 
Arthur and watched the non-stop frenetic news reports on the 
television, none of which had anything to say other than to record 
that the thing had done this amount of damage which was valued at 
that amount of billions of pounds and had killed this totally other 
number of people, and then say it again, because the robot was doing 
nothing more than standing there, swaying very slightly, and emitting 
short incomprehensible error messages. 

"It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see..." 



"You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?" 

"No," said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and 
coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down 
him, "nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On 
its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people 
hate the lizards and the lizards role the people." 

"Odd," said Arthur, "I thought you said it was a democracy." 

"I did," said Ford. "It is." 

"So," said Arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse, 
"why don't people get rid of the lizards?" 

"It honestly doesn't occur to them," said Ford. "They've all got the 
vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they've 
voted in more or less approximates to the government they want." 

"You mean they actually vote for the lizards?" 

"Oh yes," said Ford with a shrug, "of course." 

"But," said Arthur, going for the big one again, "why?" 

"Because if they didn't vote for a lizard," said Ford, "the wrong 
lizard might get in. Got any gin?" 

"What?" 

"I said," said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into 
his voice, "have you got any gin?" 

"I'll look. Tell me about the lizards." 

Ford shrugged again. 

"Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever 
happened to them," he said. "They're completely wrong of course, 
completely and utterly wrong, but someone's got to say it." 

"But that's terrible," said Arthur. 

"Listen, bud," said Ford, "if I had one Altairan dollar for every time I 
heard one bit of the Universe look at another bit of the Universe and 
say 'That's terrible' I wouldn't be sitting here like a lemon looking for a 
gin. But I haven't and I am. Anyway, what are you looking so placid 
and moon-eyed for? Are you in love?" 

Arthur said yes, he was, and said it placidly. 

"With someone who knows where the gin bottle is? Do I get to 
meet her?" 



He did because Fenchurch came in at that moment with a pile of 
newspapers she'd been into the village to buy. She stopped in 
astonishment at the wreckage on the table and the wreckage from 
Betelgeuse on the sofa. 

"Where's the gin?" said Ford to Fenchurch. And to Arthur, "What 
happened to Trillian by the way?" 

"Er, this is Fenchurch," said Arthur, awkwardly. "There was nothing 
with Trillian, you must have seen her last." 

"Oh, yeah," said Ford, "she went off with Zaphod somewhere. They 
had some kids or something. At least," he added, "I think that's what 
they were. Zaphod's calmed down a lot you know." 

"Really?" said Arthur, clustering hurriedly round Fenchurch to 
relieve her of the shopping. 

"Yeah," said Ford, "at least one of his heads is now saner than an 
emu on acid." 

"Arthur, who is this?" said Fenchurch. 

"Ford Prefect," said Arthur. "I may have mentioned him in passing." 



Chapter 37 


For a total of three days and nights the giant silver robot stood in 
stunned amazement straddling the remains of Knightsbridge, swaying 
slightly and trying to work out a number of things. 

Government deputations came to see it, ranting journalists by the 
truckload asked each other questions on the air about what they 
thought of it, flights of fighter bombers tried pathetically to attack it - 
but no lizards appeared. It scanned the horizon slowly. 

At night it was at its most spectacular, floodlit by the teams of 
television crews who covered it continuously as it continuously did 
nothing. 

It thought and thought and eventually reached a conclusion. 

It would have to send out its service robots. 

It should have thought of that before, but it was having a number 
of problems. 

The tiny flying robots came screeching out of the hatchway one 
afternoon in a terrifying cloud of metal. They roamed the surrounding 
terrain, frantically attacking some things and defending others. 

One of them at last found a pet shop with some lizards, but it 
instantly defended the pet shop for democracy so savagely that little 
in the area survived. 

A turning point came when a crack team of flying screechers 
discovered the Zoo in Regent's Park, and most particularly the reptile 
house. 

Learning a little caution from their previous mistakes in the 
petshop, the flying drills and fretsaws brought some of the larger and 
fatter iguanas to the giant silver robot, who tried to conduct high- 
level talks with them. 

Eventually the robot announced to the world that despite the full, 
frank and wide-ranging exchange of views the high level talks had 
broken down, the lizards had been retired, and that it, the robot 



would take a short holiday somewhere, and for some reason selected 
Bournemouth. 

Ford Prefect, watching it on TV, nodded, laughed, and had another 
beer. 

Immediate preparations were made for its departure. 

The flying toolkits screeched and sawed and drilled and fried things 
with light throughout that day and all through the night time, and in 
the morning, stunningly, a giant mobile gantry started to roll 
westwards on several roads simultaneously with the robot standing 
on it, supported within the gantry. 

Westward it crawled, like a strange carnival buzzed around by its 
servants and helicopters and news coaches, scything through the land 
until at last it came to Bournemouth, where the robot slowly freed 
itself from it transport system's embraces and went and lay for ten 
days on the beach. 

It was, of course, by far the most exciting thing that had ever 
happened to Bournemouth. 

Crowds gathered daily along the perimeter which was staked out 
and guarded as the robot's recreation area, and tried to see what it 
was doing. 

It was doing nothing. It was lying on the beach. It was lying a little 
awkwardly on its face. 

It was a journalist from a local paper who, late one night, managed 
to do what no one else in the world had so far managed, which was to 
strike up a brief intelligible conversation with one of the service 
robots guarding the perimeter. 

It was an extraordinary breakthrough. 

"I think there's a story in it," confided the journalist over a cigarette 
shared through the steel link fence, "but it needs a good local angle. 
I've got a little list of questions here," he went on, rummaging 
awkwardly in an inner pocket, "perhaps you could get him, it, 
whatever you call him, to run through them quickly." 

The little flying ratchet screwdriver said it would see what it cold 
do and screeched off. 

A reply was never forthcoming. 

Curiously, however, the questions on the piece of paper more or 
less exactly matched the questions that were going through the 



massive battle-scarred industrial quality circuits of the robot's mind. 
They were these: 

"How do you feel about being a robot?" 

"How does it feel to be from outer space?" and 

"How do you like Bournemouth?" 

Early the following day things started to be packed up and within a 
few days it became apparent that the robot was preparing to leave 
for good. 

"The point is," said Fenchurch to Ford, "can you get us on board?" 

Ford looked wildly at his watch. 

"I have some serious unfinished business to attend to," he 
exclaimed. 



Chapter 38 


Crowds thronged as close as they could to the giant silver craft, 
which wasn't very. The immediate perimeter was fenced off and 
patrolled by the tiny flying service robots. Staked out around that was 
the army, who had been completely unable to breach that inner 
perimeter, but were damned if anybody was going to breach them. 
They in turn were surrounded by a cordon of police, though whether 
they were there to protect the public from the army or the army from 
the public, or to guarantee the giant ship's diplomatic immunity and 
prevent it getting parking tickets was entirely unclear and the subject 
of much debate. 

The inner perimeter fence was now being dismantled. The army 
stirred uncomfortably, uncertain of how to react to the fact that the 
reason for their being there seemed as if it was simply going to get up 
and go. 

The giant robot had lurched back aboard the ship at lunchtime, and 
now it was five o'clock in the afternoon and no further sign had been 
seen of it. Much had been heard - more grindings and rumblings from 
deep within the craft, the music of a million hideous malfunctions; 
but the sense of tense expectation among the crowd was born of the 
fact that they tensely expected to be disappointed. This wonderful 
extraordinary thing had come into their lives, an now it was simply 
going to go without them. 

Two people were particularly aware of this sensation. Arthur and 
Fenchurch scanned the crowd anxiously, unable to find Ford Prefect 
in it anywhere, or any sign that he had the slightest intention of being 
there. 

"Flow reliable is he?" asked Fenchurch in a sinking voice. 

"Flow reliable?" said Arthur. Fie gave a hollow laugh. "Flow shallow 
is the ocean?" he said. "Flow cold is the sun?" 

The last parts of the robot's gantry transport were being carried on 
board, and the few remaining sections of the perimeter fence were 



now stacked at the bottom of the ramp waiting to follow them. The 
soldiers on guard round the ramp bristled meaningfully, orders were 
barked back and forth, hurried conferences were held, but nothing, of 
course, could be done about any of it. 

Hopelessly, and with no clear plan now, Arthur and Fenchurch 
pushed forward through the crowd, but since the whole crowd was 
also trying to push forward through the crowd, this got them 
nowhere. 

And within a few minutes more nothing remained outside the ship, 
every last link of the fence was aboard. A couple of flying fret saws 
and a spirit level seemed to do one last check around the site, and 
then screamed in through the giant hatchway themselves. 

A few seconds passed. 

The sounds of mechanical disarray from within changed in intensity, 
and slowly, heavily, the huge steel ramp began to lift itself back out of 
the Harrods Food Halls. The sound that accompanied it was the sound 
of thousands of tense, excited people being completely ignored. 

"Hold it!" 

A megaphone barked from a taxi which screeched to a halt on the 
edge of the milling crowd. 

"There has been," barked the megaphone, "a major scientific 
break-in! Through. Breakthrough," it corrected itself. The door flew 
open and a small man from somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse 
leapt out wearing a white coat. 

"Hold it!" he shouted again, and this time brandished a short squad 
black rod with lights on it. The lights winked briefly, the ramp paused 
in its ascent, and then in obedience to the signals from the Thumb 
(which half the electronic engineers in the galaxy are constantly trying 
to find fresh ways of jamming, while the other half are constantly 
trying to find fresh ways of jamming the jamming signals), slowly 
ground its way downwards again. 

Ford Prefect grabbed his megaphone from out of the taxi and 
started bawling at the crowd through it. 

"Make way," he shouted, "make way, please, this is a major 
scientific breakthrough. You and you, get the equipment from the 
taxi." 



Completely at random he pointed at Arthur and Fenchurch, who 
wrestled their way back out of the crowd and clustered urgently 
round the taxi. 

"All right, I want you to clear a passage, please, for some important 
pieces of scientific equipment," boomed Ford. "Just everybody keep 
calm. It's all under control, there's nothing to see. It is merely a major 
scientific breakthrough. Keep calm now. Important scientific 
equipment. Clear the way." 

Flungry for new excitement, delighted at this sudden reprieve from 
disappointment, the crowd enthusiastically fell back and started to 
open up. 

Arthur was a little surprised to see what was printed on the boxes 
of important scientific equipment in the back of the taxi. 

"Hang your coat over them," he muttered to Fenchurch as he 
heaved them out to her. Hurriedly he manoeuvred out the large 
supermarket trolley that was also jammed against the back seat. It 
clattered to the ground, and together they loaded the boxes into it. 

"Clear a path, please," shouted Ford again. "Everything's under 
proper scientific control." 

"He said you'd pay," said the taxi-driver to Arthur, who dug out 
some notes and paid him. There was the distant sound of police 
sirens. 

"Move along there," shouted Ford, "and no one will get hurt." 

The crowd surged and closed behind them again, as frantically they 
pushed and hauled the rattling supermarket trolley through the 
rubble towards the ramp. 

"It's all right," Ford continued to bellow. "There's nothing to see, 
it's all over. None of this is actually happening." 

"Clear the way, please," boomed a police megaphone from the 
back of the crowd. "There's been a break-in, clear the way." 

"Breakthrough," yelled Ford in competition. "A scientific 
breakthrough!" 

"This is the police! Clear the way!" 

"Scientific equipment! Clear the way!" 

"Police! Let us through!" 



"Walkmen!" yelled Ford, and pulled half a dozen miniature tape 
players from his pockets and tossed them into the crowd. The 
resulting seconds of utter confusion allowed them to get the 
supermarket trolley to the edge of the ramp, and to haul it up on to 
the lip of it. 

"Hold tight," muttered Ford, and released a button on his 
Electronic Thumb. Beneath them, the huge ramp juddered and bega 
slowly to heave its way upwards. 

"Ok, kids," he said as the milling crowd dropped away beneath 
them and they started to lurch their way along the tilting ramp into 
the bowels of the ship, "looks like we're on our way." 



Chapter 39 


Arthur Dent was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound 
of gunfire. 

Being careful not to wake Fenchurch, who was still managing to 
sleep fitfully, he slid his way out of the maintenance hatchway which 
they had fashioned into a kind of bunk for themselves, slung himself 
down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily. 

They were claustrophobic and ill-lit. The lighting circuits buzzed 
annoyingly. 

This wasn't it, though. 

He paused and leaned backwards as a flying power drill flew past 
him down the dim corridor with a nasty screech, occasionally clanging 
against the walls like a confused bee as it did so. 

That wasn't it either. 

He clambered through a bulkhead door and found himself in a 
larger corridor. Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end so he 
walked towards the other. 

He came to an observation monitor let into the wall behind a plate 
of toughened but still badly scratched perspex. 

"Would you turn it down please?" he said to Ford Prefect who was 
crouching in front of it in the middle of a pile of bits of video 
equipment he'd taken from a shop window in Tottenham Court Road, 
having first hurled a small brick through it, and also a nasty heap of 
empty beer cans. 

"Shhhh!" hissed Ford, and peered with manic concentration at the 
screen. He was watching The Magnificent Seven. 

"Just a bit," said Arthur. 

"No!" shouted Ford. "We're just getting to the good bit! Listen, I 
finally got it all sorted out, voltage levels, line conversion, everything, 
and this is the good bit!" 



With a sigh and a headache, Arthur sat down beside him and 
watched the good bit. He listened to Ford's whoops and yells and 
"yeehay!"s as placidly as he could. 

"Ford," he said eventually, when it was all over, and Ford was 
hunting through a stack of cassettes for the tape of Casablanca, "how 
come, if..." 

"This is the big one," said Ford. "This is the one I came back for. Do 
you realize I never saw it all through? Always I missed the end. I saw 
half of it again the night before the Vogons came. When they blew 
the place up I thought I'd never get to see it. Hey, what happened 
with all that anyway?" 

"Just life," said Arthur, and plucked a beer from a six-pack. 

"Oh, that again," said Ford. "I thought it might be something like 
that. I prefer this stuff," he said as Rick's Bar flickered on to the screen. 
"How come if what?" 

"What?" 

"You started to say, 'how come if...'" 

"How come if you're so rude about the Earth, that you... oh never 
mind, let's just watch the movie." 


"Exactly," said Ford. 



Chapter 40 


There remains little still to tell. 

Beyond what used to be known as the Limitless Lightfields of 
Flanux until the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine were discovered 
lying behind them, lie the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine. Within 
the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine lies the star named Zarss, 
around which orbits the planet Preliumtarn in which is the land of 
Sevorbeupstry, and it was to the land of Sevorbeupstry that Arthur 
and Fenchurch came at last, a little tired by the journey. 

And in the land of Sevorbeupstry, they came to the Great Red Plain 
of Rars, which was bounded on the South side by the Quentulus 
Quazgar Mountains, on the further side of which, according to the 
dying words of Prak, they would find in thirty-foot-high letters of fire 
God's Final Message to His Creation. 

According to Prak, if Arthur's memory saved him right, the place 
was guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob, and so, after a manner, 
it proved to be. He was a little man in a strange hat and he sold them 
a ticket. 

"Keep to the left, please," he said, "keep to the left," and hurried 
on past them on a little scooter. 

They realized they were not the first to pass that way, for the path 
that led around the left of the Great Plain was well-worn and dotted 
with booths. At one they bought a box of fudge, which had been 
baked in an oven in a cave in the mountain, which was heated by the 
fire of the letters that formed God's Final Message to His Creation. At 
another they bought some postcards. The letters had been blurred 
with an airbrush, "so as not to spoil the Big Surprise!" it said on the 
reverse. 

"Do you know what the message is?" they asked the wizened little 
lady in the booth. 

"Oh yes," she piped cheerily, "oh yes!" 

She waved them on. 



Every twenty miles or so there was a little stone hut with showers 
and sanitary facilities, but the going was tough, and the high sun 
baked down on the Great Red Plain, and the Great Red Plain rippled 
in the heat. 

"Is it possible," asked Arthur at one of the larger booths, "to rent 
one of those little scooters? Like the one Lajestic Ventrawhatsit had." 

"The scooters," said the little lady who was serving at an ice cream 
bar, "are not for the devout." 

"Oh well, that's easy then," said Fenchurch, "we're not particularly 
devout. We're just interested." 

"Then you must turn back now," said the little lady severely, and 
when they demurred, sold them a couple of Final Message sunhats 
and a photograph of themselves with their arms tight around each 
other on the Great Red Plain of Rars. 

They drank a couple of sodas in the shade of the booth and then 
trudged out into the sun again. 

"We're running out of border cream," said Fenchurch after a few 
more miles. "We can go to the next booth, or we can return to the 
previous one which is nearer, but means we have to retrace our steps 
again." 

They stared ahead at the distant black speck winking in the heat 
haze; they looked behind themselves. They elected to go on. 

They then discovered that they were not only not the first ones to 
make this journey, but that they were not the only ones making it 
now. 

Some way ahead of them an awkward low shape was heaving itself 
wretchedly along the ground, stumbling painfully slowly, half-limping, 
half-crawling. 

It was moving so slowly that before too long they caught the 
creature up and could see that it was made of worn, scarred and 
twisted metal. 

It groaned at them as they approached it, collapsing in the hot dry 
dust. 

"So much time," it groaned, "oh so much time. And pain as well, so 
much of that, and so much time to suffer it in too. One or the other 
on its own I could probably manage. It's the two together that really 
get me down. Oh hello, you again." 



"Marvin?" said Arthur sharply, crouching down beside it. "Is that 
you?" 

"You were always one," groaned the aged husk of the robot, "for 
the super-intelligent question, weren't you?" 

"What is it?" whispered Fenchurch in alarm, crouching behind 
Arthur, and grasping on to his arm. "He's sort of an old friend," said 
Arthur. "I..." 

"Friend!" croaked the robot pathetically. The word died away in a 
kind of crackle and flakes of rust fell out of its mouth. "You'll have to 
excuse me while I try and remember what the word means. My 
memory banks are not what they were you know, and any word 
which falls into disuse for a few zillion years has to get shifted down 
into auxiliary memory back-up. Ah, here it comes." 

The robot's battered head snapped up a bit as if in thought. 

"Hmm," he said, "what a curious concept." 

He thought a little longer. 

"No," he said at last, "don't think I ever came across one of those. 
Sorry, can't help you there." 

He scraped a knee along pathetically in the dust, an then tried to 
twist himself up on his misshapen elbows. 

"Is there any last service you would like me to perform for you 
perhaps?" he asked in a kind of hollow rattle. "A piece of paper that 
perhaps you would like me to pick up for you? Or maybe you would 
like me," he continued, "to open a door?" 

His head scratched round in its rusty neck bearings and seemed to 
scan the distant horizon. 

"Don't seem to be any doors around at present," he said, "but I'm 
sure that if we waited long enough, someone would build one. And 
then," he said slowly twisting his head around to see Arthur again, "I 
could open it for you. I'm quite used to waiting you know." 

"Arthur," hissed Fenchurch in his ear sharply, "you never told me of 
this. What have you done to this poor creature?" 

"Nothing," insisted Arthur sadly, "he's always like this..." 

"Ha!" snapped Marvin. "Ha!" he repeated. "What do you know of 
always? You say 'always' to me, who, because of the silly little errands 
your organic lifeforms keep on sending me through time on, am now 



thirty-seven times older than the Universe itself? Pick your words 
with a little more care," he coughed, "and tact." 

He rasped his way through a coughing fit and resumed. 

"Leave me," he said, "go on ahead, leave me to struggle painfully 
on my way. My time at last has nearly come. My race is nearly run. I 
fully expect," he said, feebly waving them on with a broken finger, "to 
come in last. It would be fitting. Here I am, brain the size..." 

Between them they picked him up despite his feeble protests and 
insults. The metal was so hot it nearly blistered their fingers, but he 
weighed surprisingly little, and hung limply between their arms. 

They carried him with them along the path that ran along the left 
of the Great Red Plain of Rars toward the encircling mountains of 
Quentulus Quazgar. 

Arthur attempted to explain to Fenchurch, but was too often 
interrupted by Marvin's dolorous cybernetic ravings. 

They tried to see if they could get him some spare parts at one of 
the booths, but Marvin would have none of it. 

"I'm all spare parts," he droned. 

"Let me be!" he groaned. 

"Every part of me," he moaned, "has been replaced at least fifty 
times... except..." He seemed almost imperceptibly to brighten for a 
moment. His head bobbed between them with the effort of memory. 
"Do you remember, the first time you ever met me," he said at last to 
Arthur. "I had been given the intellect-stretching task of taking you up 
to the bridge? I mentioned to you that I had this terrible pain in all the 
diodes down my left side? That I had asked for them to be replaced 
but they never were?" 

He left a longish pause before he continued. They carried him on 
between them, under the baking sun that hardly ever seemed to 
move, let alone set. 

"See if you can guess," said Marvin, when he judged that the pause 
had become embarrassing enough, "which parts of me were never 
replaced? Go on, see if you can guess. 

"Ouch," he added, "ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch." 

At last they reached the last of the little booths, set down Marvin 
between them and rested in the shade. Fenchurch bought some 
cufflinks for Russell, cufflinks that had set in them little polished 



pebbles which had been picked up from the Quentulus Quazgar 
Mountains, directly underneath the letters of fire in which was 
written God's Final Message to His Creation. 

Arthur flipped through a little rack of devotional tracts on the 
counter, little meditations on the meaning of the Message. 

"Ready?" he said to Fenchurch, who nodded. 

They heaved up Marvin between them. 

They rounded the foot of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, and 
there was the Message written in blazing letters along the crest of the 
Mountain. There was a little observation vantage point with a rail 
built along the top of a large rock facing it, from which you could get a 
good view. It had a little pay-telescope for looking at the letters in 
detail, but no one would ever use it because the letters burned with 
the divine brilliance of the heavens and would, if seen through a 
telescope, have severely damaged the retina and optic nerve. 

They gazed at God's Final Message in wonderment, and were 
slowly and ineffably filled with a great sense of peace, and of final and 
complete understanding. 

Fenchurch sighed. "Yes," she said, "that was it." 

They had been staring at it for fully ten minutes before they 
became aware that Marvin, hanging between their shoulders, was in 
difficulties. The robot could no longer lift his head, had not read the 
message. They lifted his head, but he complained that his vision 
circuits had almost gone. 

They found a coin and helped him to the telescope. He complained 
and insulted them, but they helped him look at each individual letter 
in turn. The first letter was a "w", the second an "e". Then there was a 
gap. An "a" followed, then a "p", an "o" and an "I". 

Marvin paused for a rest. 

After a few moments they resumed and let him see the "o", the "g" 
the "i", the "s" and the "e". 

The next two words were "for" and "the". The last one was a long 
one, and Marvin needed another rest before he could tackle it. 

It started with an "i", then "n" then a "c". Next came an "o" and an 
"n", followed by a "v", an "e", another "n" and an "i". 

After a final pause, Marvin gathered his strength for the last stretch 



He read the "e", the "n", the "c" and at last the final "e", and 
staggered back into their arms. 

"I think," he murmured at last, from deep within his corroding 
rattling thorax, "I feel good about it." 

The lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever. 

Luckily, there was a stall nearby where you could rent scooters 
from guys with green wings. 



Epilogue 


One of the greatest benefactors of all lifekind was a man who 
couldn't keep his mind on the job in hand. 

Brilliant? 

Certainly. 

One of the foremost genetic engineers of his or any other 
generation, including a number he had designed himself? 

Without a doubt. 

The problem was that he was far too interested in things which he 
shouldn't be interested in, at least, as people would tell him, not now. 

He was also, partly because of this, of a rather irritable disposition. 

So when his world was threatened by terrible invaders from a 
distant star, who were still a fair way off but travelling fast, he, Blart 
Versenwald III (his name was Blart Versenwald III, which is not strictly 
relevant, but quite interesting because - never mind, that was his 
name and we can talk about why it's interesting later), was sent into 
guarded seclusion by the masters of his race with instructions to 
design a breed of fanatical superwarriors to resist and vanquish the 
feared invaders, do it quickly and, they told him, "Concentrate!" 

So he sat by a window and looked out at a summer lawn and 
designed and designed and designed, but inevitably got a little 
distracted by things, and by the time the invaders were practically in 
orbit round them, had come up with a remarkable new breed of 
super-fly that could, unaided, figure out how to fly through the open 
half of a half-open window, and also an off-switch for children. 
Celebrations of these remarkable achievements seemed doomed to 
be shortlived because disaster was imminent as the alien ships were 
landing. But astoundingly, the fearsome invaders who, like most 
warlike races were only on the rampage because they couldn't cope 
with things at home, were stunned by Versenwald's extraordinary 
breakthroughs, joined in the celebrations and were instantly prevailed 
upon to sign a wide-ranging series of trading agreements and set up a 



programme of cultural exchanges. And, in an astonishing reversal of 
normal practice in the conduct of such matters, everybody concerned 
lived happily ever after. 

There was a point to this story, but it has temporarily escaped the 
chronicler's mind. 



DOUGLAS ADAMS 


YOUNG ZAPHOD PLAYS IT 

SAFE 


A large flying craft moved swiftly across the surface of an 
astoundingly beautiful sea. From mid-morning onward it plied back 
and forth in great widening arcs, and at last attracted the attention of 
the local islanders' a peaceful, sea-food-loving people who gathered 
on the beach and squinted up into the blinding sun, trying to see what 
was there. 

Any sophisticated knowledgeable person, who had knocked about, 
seen a few things, would probably have remarked on how much the 
craft looked like a filing cabinet - a large and recently burgled filing 
cabinet lying on its back with its drawers in the air and flying. 

The islanders, whose experience was of a different kind, were 
instead struck by how little it looked like a lobster. 

They chattered excitedly about its total lack of claws, its stiff 
unbending back, and the fact that it seemed to experience the 
greatest difficulty staying on the ground. This last feature seemed 
particularly funny to them. They jumped up and down on the spot a 
lot to demonstrate to the stupid thing that they themselves found 
staying on the ground the easiest thing in the world. 

But soon this entertainment began to pall for them. After all, since 
it was perfectly clear to them that the thing was not a lobster, and 
since their world was blessed with an abundance of things that were 
lobsters (a good half dozen of which were now marching succulently 
up the beach toward them), they saw no reason to waste any more 
time on the thing but decided instead to adjourn immediately for a 
late lobster lunch. 

At that exact moment the craft stopped suddenly in mid-air, then 
upended itself and plunged headlong into the ocean with a great 
crash of spray which sent them shouting into the trees. 



When they reemerged, nervously, a few minutes later, all they 
were able to see was a smoothly scarred circle of water and a few 
gulping bubbles. 

That's odd, they said to each other between mouthfuls of the best 
lobster to be had anywhere in the Western Galaxy, that's the second 
time that's happened in a year. 


The craft which wasn't a lobster dived direct to a depth of two 
hundred feet, and hung there in the heavy blueness, while vast 
masses of water swayed about it. High above, where the water was 
magically clear, a brilliant formation of fish flashed away. Below, 
where the light had difficulty reaching, the color of the water sank to 
a dark and savage. 

Here, at two hundred feet, the sun streamed feebly. A large, silk¬ 
skinned sea-mammal rolled idly by, inspecting the craft with a kind of 
half interest, as if it had half expected to find something of this kind 
around about here, and then it slid on up and away toward the 
rippling light. 

The craft waited for a minute or two, taking readings, and then 
descended another hundred feet. At this depth it was becoming 
seriously dark. After a moment or two the internal lights of the craft 
shut down, an 

in the second or so that passed before the main external beams 
suddenly; stabbed out, the only visible light came from a small hazily 
illuminated pink sign which read The Beeblebrox Salvage and Really 
Wild Stuff Corporation. 

The huge beams switched downward, catching a vast shoal of silver 
fish which swiveled away in silent panic. 

In the dim control room, which extended in a broad bow from the 
craft's blunt prow, four heads were gathered around a computer 
display that was analyzing the very, very faint and intermittent signals 
that emanated from deep on the sea bed. 

"That's it," said the owner of one of the heads finally. 

"Can we be quite sure?" said the owner of another of the heads. 

"One hundred percent positive," replied the owner of the first head. 



"You're one hundred percent positive that the ship which is 
crashed on the bottom of this ocean is the ship which you said you 
were one hundred percent positive could one hundred percent 
positively never crash?" said the owner of the two remaining heads. 
"Hey," he put up two of his hands, "I'm only asking." 

The two officials from the Safety and Civil Reassurance 
Administration responded to this with a very cold stare, but the man 
with the odd, or rather the even, number of heads missed it. He flung 
himself back on the pilot couch, opened a couple of beers - one for 
himself and the other also for himself - stuck his feet on the console 
and said "Hey, baby" through the ultra-glass at a passing fish. 

"Mr. Beeblebrox..." began the shorter and less reassuring of the 
two officials in a low voice. 

"Yup?" said Zaphod, rapping a suddenly empty can down on some 
of the more sensitive instruments. "You ready to dive; Let's go." 

"Mr. Beeblebrox, let us make one thing perfectly clear..." 

"Yeah let's," said Zaphod. "How about this for a start. Why don't 
you just tell me what's really on this ship." 

"We have told you," said the official. "By-products." 

Zaphod exchanged weary glances with himself. 

"By-products," he said. "By-products of what?" 

"Processes," said the official. 

"What processes?" 

"Processes that are perfectly safe." 

"Santa Zarquana Voostra!" exclaimed both of Zaphod's heads in 
chorus. "So safe that you have to build a zarking fortress ship to take 
the byproducts to the nearest black hole and tip them in! Only it 
doesn't get there because the pilot takes a detour - is this right? - to 
pick up some lobster...? OK, so the guy is cool, but... I mean own up, 
this is barking time, this is major lunch, this is stool approaching 
critical mass, this is... this is... total vocabulary failure!" 

"Shut up!" his right head yelled at his left, "we're flanging!" 

He got a good calming grip on the remaining beer can. 

"Listen, guys," he resumed after a moment's peace and 
contemplation. The two officials had said nothing. Conversation at 
this level was not something to which they felt they could aspire. "I 



just want to know," insisted Zaphod, "what you're getting me into 
here." 

He stabbed a finger at the intermittent readings trickling over the 
computer screen. They meant nothing to him but he didn't like the 
look of them at all. They were all squiggly with lots of long numbers 
and things. 

"It's breaking up, is that it?" he shouted. "It's got a hold full of 
epsilonic radiating aorist rods or something that'll fry this whole space 
sector for zillions of years back and it's breaking up. Is that the story? 

Is that what we're going down to find? Am I going to come out of that 
wreck with even more heads?" 

"It cannot possibly be a wreck, Mr. Beeblebrox," insisted the official, 
"the ship is guaranteed to be perfectly safe. It cannot possibly break 
up." 

"Then why are you so keen to go and look at it?" 

"We like to look at things that are perfectly safe." 

"Freeeooow!" 

"Mr. Beeblebrox," said the official, patiently, "may I remind you 
that you have a job to do?" 

"Yeah, well, maybe I don't feel so keen on doing it all of a sudden. 
What do you think I am, completely without any moral whatsits, what 
are they called, those moral things?" 

"Scruples?" 

"Scruples, thank you, whatsoever? Well?" 

The two officials waited calmly. They coughed slightly to help pass 
the time. 

Zaphod sighed a "what is the world coming to" sort of sigh to 
absolve himself from all blame, and swung himself around in his seat. 

"Ship?" he called. 

"Yup?" said the ship. 

"Do what I do." 

The ship thought about this for a few milliseconds and then, after 
double checking all the seals on its heavy duty bulkheads, it began 
slowly, inexorably, in the hazy blaze of its lights, to sink to the lowest 
depths. 



Five hundred feet. 

A thousand. 

Two thousand. 

Here, at a pressure of nearly seventy atmospheres, in the chilling 
depths where no light reaches, nature keeps its most heated 
imaginings. Two foo6: long nightmares loomed wildly into the 
bleaching light, yawned, and vanished back into the blackness. 

Two and a half thousand feet. 

At the dim edges of the ship's lights guilty secrets flitted by with 
their eyes on stalks. 

Gradually the topography of the distantly approaching ocean bed 
resolved with greater and greater clarity on the computer displays 
until as last a shape could be made out that was separate and distinct 
from its surroundings. It was like a huge lopsided cylindrical fortress 
that widened sharply halfway along its length to accommodate the 
heavy ultraplating with which the crucial storage holds were clad, and 
which were supposed by its builders to have made this the most 
secure and impregnable spaceship ever built. Before launch the 
material structure of this section had been battered, rammed, blasted 
and subjected to every assault its builders knew it could withstand in 
order to demonstrate that it could withstand them. 

The tense silence in the cockpit tightened perceptibly as it became 
dear that it was this section that had broken rather neatly in two. 

"In fact it's perfectly safe," said one of the officials, "it's built so 
that even if the ship does break up, the storage holds cannot possibly 
be breached." 


Three thousand, eight hundred and twenty-five feet. 

Four Hi-Presh-A Smart Suits moved slowly out of the open 
hatchway of the salvage craft and waded through the barrage of its 
lights toward the monstrous shape that loomed darkly out of the sea 
night. They moved with a sort of clumsy grace, near weightlessness 
though weighed on by a world of water. 

With his right-hand head Zaphod peered up into the black 
immensities above him and for a moment his mind sang with a silent 



roar of horror. He glanced to his left and was relieved to see that his 
other head was busy watching the Brockian Ultra-Cricket broadcasts 
on the helmet vid without concern. Slightly behind him to his left 
walked the two officials from the Safety and Civil Reassurance 
Administration, slightly in front of him to his right walked the empty 
suit, carrying their implements and testing the way for them. 

They passed the huge rift in the broken backed Starship Billion Year 
Bunker, and played their flashlights up into it. Mangled machinery 
loomed between torn and twisted bulkheads, two feet thick. A family 
of large transparent eels lived in there now and seemed to like it. 

The empty suit preceded them along the length of the ship's 
gigantic murky hull, trying the airlocks. The third one it tested ground 
open uneasily. They crowded inside it and waited for several long 
minutes while the pump mechanisms dealt with the hideous pressure 
that the ocean exerted, and slowly replaced it with an equally hideous 
pressure of air and inert gases. At last the inner door slid open and 
they were admitted to a dark outer holding area of the Starship Billion 
Year Bunker. 

Several more high security Titan-O-Hold doors had to be passed 
through, each of which the officials opened with a selection of quark 
keys. Soon they were so deep within the heavy security fields that the 
UltraCricket broadcasts were beginning to fade, and Zaphod had to 
switch to one of the rock video stations, since there was nowhere that 
they were not able to reach. 

A final doorway slid open, and they emerged into a large sepulchral 
space. Zaphod played his flashlight against the opposite wall and it fell 
full on a wild-eyed screaming face. 

Zaphod screamed a diminished fifth himself, dropped his light and 
sat heavily on the floor, or rather on a body which had been lying 
there undisturbed for around six months and which reacted to being 
sat on by exploding with great violence. Zaphod wondered what to do 
about all this, and after a brief but hectic internal debate decided that 
passing out would be the very thing. 

He came to a few minutes later and pretended not to know who he 
was, where he was or how he had got there, but was nor able to 
convince anybody. He then pretended that his memory suddenly 
retuned with a rush and that the shock caused him to pass out again, 
but he was helped unwillingly to his feet by the empty suit - which he 



was beginning to take a serious dislike to - and forced to come to 
terms with his surroundings: 

They were dimly and fitfully lit and unpleasant in a number of 
respects, the most obvious of which was the colorful arrangement of 
parts of the ship's late lamented Navigation Officer over the floor, 
walls and ceiling, and especially over the lower half of his, Zaphod's, 
suit. The effect of this was so astoundingly nasty that we shall not be 
referring to it again at any point in this narrative - other than to 
record briefly the fact that it caused Zaphod to throw up inside his 
suit, which he therefore removed and swapped, after suitable 
headgear modifications, with the empty one. Unfortunately the 
stench of the fetid air in the ship, followed by the sight of his own suit 
walking around casually draped in rotting intestines was enough to 
make him throw up in the other suit as well, which was a problem 
that he and the suit would simply have to live with. 

There. All done. No more nastiness. 

At least, no more of that particular nastiness. 

The owner of the screaming face had calmed down very slightly 
now and was babbling away incoherently in a large tank of yellow 
liquid- 

emergency suspension tank. 

"It was crazy," he babbled, "crazy! I told him we could always try 
the lobster on the way back, but he was crazy. Obsessed! Do you ever 
get like that about lobster? Because I don't. Seems to me it's all 
rubbery and fiddly to eat, and not that much taste, well I mean is 
there? I infinitely prefer scallops, and said so. Oh Zarquon, I said so!" 

Zaphod stared at this extraordinary apparition, flailing in its tank. 
The man was attached to all kinds of life-support tubes, and his voice 
was bubbling out of speakers that echoed insanely around the ship, 
returning as haunting echoes from deep and distant corridors. 

"That was where I went wrong," the madman yelled, "I actually 
said that I preferred scallops and he said it was because I hadn't had 
real lobster like they did where his ancestors came from, which was 
here, and he'd prove it. He said it was no problem, he said the lobster 
here was worth a whole journey, let alone the small diversion it 
would take to get here, and he swore he could handle the ship in the 
atmosphere, but it was madness, madness!" he screamed, and 
paused with his eyes rolling, as if the word had rung some kind of bell 



in his mind. "The ship went right out of control! I couldn't believe 
what we were doing and just to prove a point about lobster which is 
really so overrated as a food, I'm sorry to go on about lobsters so 
much. I'll try and stop in a minute, but they've been on my mind so 
much for the months I've been in this tank, can you imagine what it's 
like to be stuck in a ship with the same guys for months eating junk 
food when all one guy will talk about is lobster and then spend six 
months floating by yourself in a tank thinking about it. I promise I will 
try and shut up about the lobsters, I really will. Lobsters, lobsters, 
lobsters - enough! I think I'm the only survivor. I'm the only one who 
managed to get to an emergency tank before we went down. I sent 
out the Mayday and then we hit. It's a disaster, isn't it? A total 
disaster, and all because the guy liked lobsters. How much sense am I 
making? It's really hard for me to tell." 

He gazed at them beseechingly, and his mind seemed to sway 
slowly back down to earth like a falling leaf. He blinked and looked at 
them oddly like a monkey peering at a strange fish. He scrabbled 
curiously with his wrinkled up fingers at the glass side of the tank. 
Tiny, thick yellow bubbles loosed themselves from his mouth and 
nose, caught briefly in his swab of hair and strayed on upward. 

"Oh Zarquon, oh heavens," he mumbled pathetically to himself, 
"I've been found. I've been rescued...." 

"Well," said one of the officials, briskly,"you've been found at 
least." He strode over to the main computer bank in the middle of the 
chamber and started checking quickly through the ship's main 
monitor circuits for damage reports. 

"The aorist rod chambers are intact," he said. 

"Holy dingo's dos," snarled Zaphod, "there are aorist rods on 
board...!" 

Aorist rods were devices used in a now happily abandoned form of 
energy production. When the hunt for new sources of energy had at 
one point got particularly frantic, one bright young chap suddenly 
spotted that one place which had never used up all its available 
energy - the past. And with the sudden rush of blood to the head that 
such insights tend to induce, he invented a way of mining it that very 
same night, and within a year huge tracts of the past were being 
drained of all their energy and simply wasting away Those who 
claimed that the past should be left unspoiled were accused of 



indulging in an extremely expensive form of sentimentality. The past 
provided a very cheap, plentiful and clean source of energy, there 
could always be a few Natural Past Reserves set up if anyone wanted 
to pay for their upkeep, and as for the claim that draining the past 
impoverished the present, well, maybe it did, slightly, but the effects 
were immeasurable and you really had to keep a sense of proportion. 

It was only when it was realized that the present really was being 
impoverished, and that the reason for it was that those selfish 
plundering wastrel bastards up in the future were doing exactly the 
same thing, that everyone realized that every single aorist rod, and 
the terrible secret of how they were made, would have to be utterly 
and forever destroyed. They claimed it was for the sake of their 
grandparents and grandchildren, but it was of course for the sake of 
their grandparent's grandchildren, and their grandchildren's 
grandparents. 

The official from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration 
gave a dismissive shrug. 

"They're perfectly safe," he said. He glanced up at Zaphod and 
suddenly said with uncharacteristic frankness,"There's worse than 
that on board. At least," he added, tapping at one of the computer 
screens, "I hope it's on board." 

The other official rounded on him sharply. 

"What the hell do you think you're saying?" he snapped. 

The first shrugged again. He said, "It doesn't matter. He can say 
what he likes. No one would believe him. It's why we chose to use 
him rather than do anything official, isn't it? The more wild the story 
he tells, the more it'll sound like he's some hippy adventurer making it 
up. He can even say that we said this and it'll make him sound like a 
paranoid." He smile' pleasantly at Zaphod who was seething in his 
nasty suit. "You may accompany us," he told him, "if you wish." 


"You see?" said the official, examining the ultra-titanium outer 
seals of the aorist rod hold. "Perfectly secure, perfectly safe." 

He said the same thing as they passed holds containing chemical 
weapons so powerful that a teaspoonful could fatally infect an entire 
planet. 



He said the same thing as they passed holds containing zeta-activq. 
compounds so powerful that a teaspoonful could blow up a whole 
planet. 

He said the same thing as they passed holds containing theta-active 
compounds so powerful that a teaspoonful could irradiate a whole 
planet. 

"I'm glad I'm not a planet," muttered Zaphod. 

"You'd have nothing to fear," assured the official from the Safety 
and Civil Reassurance Administration, "planets are very safe. 
Provided," he added - and paused. They were approaching the hold 
nearest to the point where the back of the Starship Billion Year 
Bunker was broken. The corridor here was twisted and deformed, and 
the floor was damp and sticky in patches. 

"Ho hum," he said,"ho very much hum." 

"What's in this hold?" demanded Zaphod. 

"By-products," said the official, clamming up again. 

"By-products...," insisted Zaphod, quietly, "of what?" 

Neither official answered. Instead, they examined the hold door 
very carefully and saw that its seals were twisted apart by the forces 
that had deformed the whole corridor. One of them touched the door 
lightly. It swung open to his touch. There was darkness inside, with 
just a couple of dim yellow lights deep within it. 

"Of what?" hissed Zaphod. 

The leading official turned to the other. 

"There's an escape capsule," he said, "that the crew were to use to 
abandon ship before jettisoning it into the black hole," he said. "I 
think it would be good to know that it's still there." The other official 
nodded and left without a word. 

The first official quietly beckoned Zaphod in. The large dim yellow 
lights glowed about twenty feet from them. 

"The reason," he said, quietly, "why everything else in this ship is, I 
maintain, safe, is that no one is really crazy enough to use them. No 
one. At least no one that crazy would ever get near them. Anyone 
that mad or dangerous rings very deep alarm bells. People may be 
stupid but they're not that stupid." 

"By-products," hissed Zaphod again, he had to hiss in order that his 
voice shouldn't be heard to tremble, "of what." 



"Er, Designer People." 

"What? " 

"The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation was awarded a huge research 
grant to design and produce synthetic personalities to order. The 
results were uniformly disastrous. All the 'people' and 'personalities' 
turned out to be amalgams of characteristics that simply could not co¬ 
exist in naturally occurring life forms. Most of them were just poor 
pathetic misfits, but some were deeply, deeply dangerous. Dangerous 
because they didn't ring alarm bells in other people. They could walk 
through situations the way that ghosts walk through walls, because 
no one spotted the danger. 

"The most dangerous of all were three identical ones - they were 
put in this hold, to be blasted, with this ship, right out of this universe. 
They are not evil, in fact they are rather simple and charming. But 
they are the most dangerous creatures that ever lived because there 
is nothing they will not do if allowed, and nothing they will not be 
allowed to do...." 

Zaphod looked at the dim yellow lights, the two dim yellow lights. 
As his eyes became accustomed to the light he saw that the two lights 
framed a third space where something was broken. Wet sticky 
patches gleamed dully on the floor. 

Zaphod and the official walked cautiously toward the lights. At that 
moment, four words came crashing into the helmet headsets from 
the other official. 

"The capsule is gone," he said tersely. 

"Trace it," snapped Zaphod's companion. "Find exactly where it has 
gone. We must know where it has gone!" 

Zaphod slid aside a large ground-glass door. Beyond it lay a tank 
full of thick yellow liquid, and floating in it was a man, a kindly looking 
man with lots of pleasant laugh lines around his face. He seemed to 
be floating quite contentedly and smiling to himself. 

Another terse message suddenly came through his helmet headset. 
The planet toward which the escape capsule had headed had already 
been identified. It was in Galactic Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. 

The kindly looking man in the tank seemed to be babbling gently to 
himself, just as the co-pilot had been in his tank. Little yellow bubbles 
beaded on the man's lips. Zaphod found a small speaker by the tank 



and turned it on. He heard the man babbling gently about a shining 
city on a hill. 

He also heard the official from the Safety and Civil Reassurance 
Administration issue instructions that the planet in ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha 
must be made "perfectly safe."

MOSTLY HARMLESS 


For Ron 

With grateful thanks to Sue Freestone and Michael Bywater for 
their support, help and the constructive abuse. 

Anything that happens, happens. 


Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, 
causes something else to happen. 


Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, happens

It doesn't necessarily do it in chronological order, though. 



Chapter 1 


The history of the Galaxy has got a little muddled, for a number of 
reasons: partly because those who are trying to keep track of it have 
got a little muddled, but also because some very muddling things 
have been happening anyway. 

One of the problems has to do with the speed of light and the 
difficulties involved in trying to exceed it. You can't. Nothing travels 
faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news, 
which obeys its own special laws. The Hingefreel people of 
Arkintoofle Minor did try to build spaceships that were powered by 
bad news but they didn't work particularly well and were so 
extremely unwelcome whenever they arrived anywhere that there 
wasn't really any point in being there. 

So, by and large, the peoples of the Galaxy tended to languish in 
their own local muddles and the history of the Galaxy itself was, for a 
long time, largely cosmological. 

Which is not to say that people weren't trying. They tried sending 
off fleets of spaceships to do battle or business in distant parts, but 
these usually took thousands of years to get anywhere. By the time 
they eventually arrived, other forms of travel had been discovered 
which made use of hyperspace to circumvent the speed of light, so 
that whatever battles it was that the slower-than-light fleets had 
been sent to fight had already been taken care of centuries earlier by 
the time they actually got there. 

This didn't, of course, deter their crews from wanting to fight the 
battles anyway. They were trained, they were ready, they'd had a 
couple of thousand years sleep, they'd come a long way to do a tough 
job and by Zarquon they were going to do it. 

This was when the first major muddles of Galactic history set in, 
with battles continually re-erupting centuries after the issues they 
had been fought over had supposedly been settled. However, these 
muddles were as nothing to the ones which historians had to try and 



unravel once time-travel was discovered and battles started pre¬ 
erupting hundreds of years before the issues even arose. When the 
Infinite Improbability Drive arrived and whole planets started turning 
unexpectedly into banana fruitcake, the great history faculty of the 
University of Maxi Mega Ion finally gave up, closed itself down and 
surrendered its buildings to the rapidly growing joint faculty of 
Divinity and Water Polo, which had been after them for years. 

Which is all very well, of course, but it almost certainly means that 
no one will ever know for sure where, for instance, the Grebulons 
came from, or exactly what it was they wanted. And this is a pity, 
because if anybody had known anything about them, it is just possible 
that a most terrible catastrophe would have been averted - or at 
least would have had to find a different way to happen. 

Click, hum. 

The huge grey Grebulon reconnaissance ship moved silently 
through the black void. It was travelling at fabulous, breath-taking 
speed, yet appeared, against the glimmering background of a billion 
distant stars to be moving not at all. It was just one dark speck frozen 
against an infinite granularity of brilliant night. 

On board the ship, everything was as it had been for millennia, 
deeply dark and silent. 

Click, hum. 

At least, almost everything. 

Click, click, hum. 

Click, hum, click, hum, click, hum. 

Click, click, click, click, click, hum. 

Hmmm. 

A low level supervising program woke up a slightly higher level 
supervising program deep in the ship's semi-somnolent cyberbrain 
and reported to it that whenever it went click all it got was a hum. 

The higher level supervising program asked it what it was supposed 
to get, and the low level supervising program said that it couldn't 
remember exactly, but thought it was probably more of a sort of 
distant satisfied sigh, wasn't it? It didn't know what this hum was. 
Click, hum, click, hum. That was all it was getting. 



The higher level supervising program considered this and didn't like 
it. It asked the low level supervising program what exactly it was 
supervising and the low level supervising program said it couldn't 
remember that either, just that it was something that was meant to 
go click, sigh every ten years or so, which usually happened without 
fail. It had tried to consult its error look-up table but couldn't find it, 
which was why it had alerted the higher level supervising program to 
the problem. 

The higher level supervising program went to consult one of its 
own look-up tables to find out what the low level supervising program 
was meant to be supervising. 

It couldn't find the look-up table. 

Odd. 

It looked again. All it got was an error message. It tried to look up 
the error message in its error message look-up table and couldn't find 
that either. It allowed a couple of nanoseconds to go by while it went 
through all this again. Then it woke up its sector function supervisor. 

The sector function supervisor hit immediate problems. It called its 
supervising agent which hit problems too. Within a few millionths of a 
second virtual circuits that had lain dormant, some for years, some for 
centuries, were flaring into life throughout the ship. Something, 
somewhere, had gone terribly wrong, but none of the supervising 
programs could tell what it was. At every level, vital instructions were 
missing, and the instructions about what to do in the event of 
discovering that vital instructions were missing, were also missing. 

Small modules of software-agents-surged through the logical 
pathways, grouping, consulting, re-grouping. They quickly established 
that the ship's memory, all the way back to its central mission module, 
was in tatters. No amount of interrogation could determine what it 
was that had happened. Even the central mission module itself 
seemed to be damaged. 

This made the whole problem very simple to deal with. Replace the 
central mission module. There was another one, a backup, an exact 
duplicate of the original. It had to be physically replaced because, for 
safety reasons, there was no link whatsoever between the original 
and its backup. Once the central mission module was replaced it 
could itself supervise the reconstruction of the rest of the system in 
every detail, and all would be well. 



Robots were instructed to bring the backup central mission module 
from the shielded strong room, where they guarded it, to the ship's 
logic chamber for installation. 

This involved the lengthy exchange of emergency codes and 
protocols as the robots interrogated the agents as to the authenticity 
of the instructions. At last the robots were satisfied that all 
procedures were correct. They unpacked the backup central mission 
module from its storage housing, carried it out of the storage 
chamber, fell out of the ship and went spinning off into the void. 

This provided the first major clue as to what it was that was wrong. 

Further investigation quickly established what it was that had 
happened. A meteorite had knocked a large hole in the ship. The ship 
had not previously detected this because the meteorite had neatly 
knocked out that part of the ship's processing equipment which was 
supposed to detect if the ship had been hit by a meteorite. The first 
thing to do was to try to seal up the hole. This turned out to be 
impossible, because the ship's sensors couldn't see that there was a 
hole, and the supervisors which should have said that the sensors 
weren't working properly weren't working properly and kept saying 
that the sensors were fine. The ship could only deduce the existence 
of the hole from the fact that the robots had clearly fallen out of it, 
taking its spare brain, which would have enabled it to see the hole, 
with them. 

The ship tried to think intelligently about this, failed, and then 
blanked out completely for a bit. It didn't realise it had blanked out, of 
course, because it had blanked out. It was merely surprised to see the 
stars jump. After the third time the stars jumped the ship finally 
realised that it must be blanking out, and that it was time to take 
some serious decisions. 

It relaxed. 

Then it realised it hadn't actually taken the serious decisions yet 
and panicked. It blanked out again for a bit. When it awoke again it 
sealed all the bulkheads around where it knew the unseen hole must 
be. 

It clearly hadn't got to its destination yet, it thought, fitfully, but 
since it no longer had the faintest idea where its destination was or 
how to reach it, there seemed to be little point in continuing. It 



consulted what tiny scraps of instructions it could reconstruct from 
the tatters of its central mission module. 

"Your!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! year mission is 
to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, land!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a safe 
distance!!!!!!!!!!., land. 

monitor it.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..." 

All of the rest was complete garbage. 

Before it blanked out for good the ship would have to pass on 
those instructions, such as they were, to its more primitive subsidiary 
systems. 

It must also revive all of its crew. 

There was another problem. While the crew was in hibernation, 
the minds of all of its members, their memories, their identities and 
their understanding of what they had come to do, had all been 
transferred into the ship's central mission module for safe keeping. 
The crew would not have the faintest idea of who they were or what 
they were doing there. Oh well. 

Just before it blanked out for the final time, the ship realised that 
its engines were beginning to give out too. 

The ship and its revived and confused crew coasted on under the 
control of its subsidiary automatic systems, which simply looked to 
land wherever they could find to land and monitor whatever they 
could find to monitor. 

As far as finding something to land on was concerned, they didn't 
do very well. The planet they found was desolately cold and lonely, so 
achingly far from the sun that should warm it, that it took all of the 
Envir-O-Form machinery and LifeSupport-O-Systems they carried with 
them to render it, or at least enough parts of it, habitable. There were 
better planets nearer in, but the ship's Strateej-O-Mat was obviously 
locked into Lurk mode and chose the most distant and unobtrusive 
planet and, further-more, would not be gainsaid by anybody other 
than the ship's Chief Strategic Officer. Since everybody on the ship 
had lost their minds no one knew who the Chief Strategic Officer was 
or, even if he could have been identified, how he was supposed to go 
about gainsaying the ship's Strateej-O-Mat. 

As far as finding something to monitor was concerned, though, 
they hit solid gold. 









Chapter 2 


One of the extraordinary things about life is the sort of places it's 
prepared to put up with living. Anywhere it can get some kind of a 
grip, whether it's the intoxicating seas of Santraginus V, where the 
fish never seem to care whatever the heck kind of direction they swim 
in, the fire storms of Frastra where, they say, life begins at 40,000 
degrees, or just burrowing around in the lower intestine of a rat for 
the sheer unadulterated hell of it, life will always find a way of 
hanging on in somewhere. 

It will even live in New York, though it's hard to know why. In the 
winter time the temperature falls well below the legal minimum, or 
rather it would do if anybody had the common sense to set a legal 
minimum. The last time anybody made a list of the top hundred 
character attributes of New Yorkers, common sense snuck in at 
number 79. 

In the summer it's too darn hot. It's one thing to be the sort of life 
form that thrives on heat and finds, as the Frastrans do, that the 
temperature range between 40,000 and 40,004 is very equable, but 
it's quite another to be the sort of animal that has to wrap itself up in 
lots of other animals at one point in your planet's orbit, and then find, 
half an orbit later, that your skin's bubbling. 

Spring is over-rated. A lot of the inhabitants of New York will honk 
on mightily about the pleasures of spring, but if they actually knew 
the first thing about the pleasures of spring they would know of at 
least five thousand nine hundred and eighty-three better places to 
spend it than New York, and that's just on the same latitude. 

Fall, though, is the worst. Few things are worse than fall in New 
York. Some of the things that live in the lower intestines of rats would 
disagree, but most of the things that live in the lower intestines of 
rats are highly disagreeable anyway, so their opinion can and should 
be discounted. When it's fall in New York, the air smells as if 
someone's been frying goats in it, and if you are keen to breathe, the 
best plan is to open a window and stick your head in a building. 



Tricia McMillan loved New York. She kept on telling herself this 
over and over again. The Upper West Side. Yeah. Mid Town. Hey, 
great retail. SoHo. The East Village. Clothes. Books. Sushi. Italian. Delis. 
Yo. 

Movies. Yo also. Tricia had just been to see Woody Allen's new 
movie which was all about the angst of being neurotic in New York. 

He had made one or two other movies that had explored the same 
theme, and Tricia wondered if he had ever considered moving, but 
heard that he had set his face against the idea. So: more movies, she 
guessed. 

Tricia loved New York because loving New York was a good career 
move. It was a good retail move, a good cuisine move, not a good taxi 
move or a great quality of pavement move, but definitely a career 
move that ranked amongst the highest and the best. Tricia was a TV 
anchor person, and New York was where most of the world's TV was 
anchored. Tricia's TV anchoring had been done exclusively in Britain 
up to that point: regional news, then breakfast news, early evening 
news. She would have been called, if the language allowed, a rapidly 
rising anchor, but... hey, this is television, what does it matter? She 
was a rapidly rising anchor. She had what it took: great hair, a 
profound understanding of strategic lip gloss, the intelligence to 
understand the world and a tiny secret interior deadness which 
meant she didn't care. Everybody has their moment of great 
opportunity in life. If you happen to miss the one you care about, 
then everything else in life becomes eerily easy. 

Tricia had only ever missed one opportunity. These days it didn't 
even make her tremble quite so much as it used to think about it. She 
guessed it was that bit of her that had gone dead. 

NBS needed a new anchor. Mo Minetti was leaving the US/AM 
breakfast show to have a baby. She had been offered a mind-bubbling 
amount of money to have it on the show, but she had declined, 
unexpectedly, on grounds of personal privacy and taste. Teams of 
NBS lawyers had sieved through her contract to see if these 
constituted legitimate grounds, but in the end, reluctantly, they had 
to let her go. This was, for them, particularly galling because normally 
"reluctantly letting someone go" was an expression that had its boot 
on quite another foot. 



The word was out that maybe, just maybe, a British accent would 
fit. The hair, the skin tone and the bridgework would have to be up to 
American network standards, but there had been a lot of British 
accents up there thanking their mothers for their Oscars, a lot of 
British accents singing on Broadway, and some unusually big 
audiences tuning in to British accents in wigs on Masterpiece Theatre. 
British accents were telling jokes on David Letterman and Jay Leno. 
Nobody understood the jokes but they were really responding to the 
accents, so maybe it was time, just maybe. A British accent on US/AM. 
Well, hell. 

That was why Tricia was here. This was why loving New York was a 
great career move. 

It wasn't, of course, the stated reason. Her TV company back in the 
UK would hardly have stumped up the air fare and hotel bill for her to 
go job hunting in Manhattan. Since she was chasing something like 
ten times her present salary, they might have felt that she could have 
forked out her own expenses, but she'd found a story, found a pretext, 
kept very quiet about anything ulterior, and they'd stumped up for 
the trip. A business class ticket, of course, but her face was known 
and she'd smiled herself an upgrade. The right moves had got her a 
nice room at the Brentwood and here she was, wondering what to do 
next. 

The word on the street was one thing, making contact was another. 
She had a couple of names, a couple of numbers, but all it took was 
being put on indeterminate hold a couple of times and she was back 
at square one. She'd put out feelers, left messages, but so far none 
had been returned. The actual job she had come to do she had done 
in a morning; the imagined job she was after was only shimmering 
tantalisingly on an unreachable horizon. 

Shit. 

She caught a cab from the movie theatre back to the Brentwood. 
The cab couldn't get close to the kerb because a big stretch limo was 
hogging all the available space and she had to squeeze her way past it. 
She walked out of the fetid, goat-frying air and into the blessed cool 
of the lobby. The fine cotton of her blouse was sticking like grime to 
her skin. Her hair felt as if she'd bought it at a fairground on a stick. At 
the front desk she asked if there were any messages, grimly expecting 
none. There was one. 



Oh... 

Good. 

It had worked. She had gone out to the movie specifically in order 
to make the phone ring. She couldn't bear sitting in a hotel room 
waiting. 

She wondered. Should she open the message down here? Her 
clothes were itching and she longed to take them all off and just lie on 
the bed. She had turned the air conditioning way down to its bottom 
temperature setting, way up to its top fan setting. What she wanted 
more than anything else in the world at the moment was goose 
pimples. Then a hot shower, then a cool one, then lying on a towel, 
on the bed again, drying in the air conditioning. Then reading the 
message. Maybe more goose pimples. Maybe all sorts of things. 

No. What she wanted more than anything else in the world was a 
job in American television at ten times her current salary. More than 
anything else in the world. In the world. What she wanted more than 
anything else at all was no longer a live issue. 

She sat on a chair in the lobby, under a kentia palm, and opened 
the little cellophane-windowed envelope. 

"Please call," it said. "Not happy," and gave a number. The name 
was Gail Andrews. 

Gail Andrews. 

It wasn't a name she was expecting. It caught her unawares. She 
recognised it, but couldn't immediately say why. Was she Andy 
Martin's secretary? Hilary Bass's assistant? Martin and Bass were the 
two major contact calls she had made, or tried to make, at NBS. And 
what did "Not happy" mean? 

"Not happy?" 

She was completely bewildered. Was this Woody Allen trying to 
contact her under an assumed name? It was a 212 area code number. 
So it was someone in New York. Who was not happy. Well, that 
narrowed it down a bit, didn't it? 

She went back to the receptionist at the desk. 

"I have a problem with this message you just gave me," she said. 
"Someone I don't know has tried to call me and says she's not happy." 

The receptionist peered at the note with a frown. 

"Do you know this person?" he said. 



"No," Tricia said. 

"Hmmm," said the receptionist. "Sounds like she's not happy about 
something." 

"Yes," said Tricia. 

"Looks like there's a name here," said the receptionist. "Gail 
Andrews. Do you know anybody of that name?" 

"No," said Tricia. 

"Any idea what she's unhappy about?" 

"No," said Tricia. 

"Have you called the number? There's a number here." 

"No," said Tricia, "you only just gave me the note. I'm just trying to 
get some more information before I ring back. Perhaps I could talk to 
the person who took the call?" 

"Hmmm," said the receptionist, scrutinising the note carefully. "I 
don't think we have anybody called Gail Andrews here." 

"No, I realise that," said Tricia. "I just - " 

"I'm Gail Andrews." 

The voice came from behind Tricia. She turned round. 

"I'm sorry?" 

"I'm Gail Andrews. You interviewed me this morning." 

"Oh. Oh good heavens yes," said Tricia, slightly flustered. 

"I left the message for you a few hours ago. I hadn't heard so I 
came by. I didn't want to miss you." 

"Oh. No. Of course," said Tricia, trying hard to get up to speed. 

"I don't know about this," said the receptionist, for whom speed 
was not an issue. "Would you like me to try this number for you 
now?" 

"No, that'll be fine, thanks," said Tricia. "I can handle it now." 

"I can call this room number here for you if that'll help," said the 
receptionist, peering at the note again. 

"No, that won't be necessary, thanks," said Tricia. "That's my own 
room number. I'm the one the message was for. I think we've sorted 
this out now." 

"You have a nice day now," said the receptionist. 

Tricia didn't particularly want to have a nice day. She was busy. 



She also didn't want to talk to Gail Andrews. She had a very strict 
cut-off point as far as fraternising with the Christians was concerned. 
Her colleagues called her interview subjects Christians and would 
often cross themselves when they saw one walking innocently into 
the studio to face Tricia, particularly if Tricia was smiling warmly and 
showing her teeth. 

She turned and smiled frostily, wondering what to do. 

Gail Andrews was a well-groomed woman in her mid-forties. Her 
clothes fell within the boundaries defined by expensive good taste, 
but were definitely huddled up at the floatier end of those boundaries. 
She was an astrologer - a famous and, if rumour were true, influential 
astrologer, having allegedly influenced a number of decisions made 
by the late President Hudson, including everything from which flavour 
of cream whip to have on which day of the week, to whether or not to 
bomb Damascus. 

Tricia had savaged her more than somewhat. Not on the grounds 
of whether or not the stories about the President were true, that was 
old hat now. At the time Ms. Andrews had emphatically denied 
advising President Hudson on anything other than personal, spiritual 
or dietary matters, which did not, apparently include the bombing of 
Damascus. ("NOTHING PERSONAL, DAMASCUS!" the tabloids had 
hooted at the time.) 

No, this was a neat topical little angle that Tricia had come up with 
about the whole issue of astrology itself. Ms. Andrews had not been 
entirely ready for it. Tricia, on the other hand, was not entirely ready 
for a re-match in the hotel lobby. What to do? 

"I can wait for you in the bar, if you need a few minutes," said Gail 
Andrews. "But I would like to talk to you, and I'm leaving the city 
tonight." 

She seemed to be slightly anxious about something rather than 
aggrieved or irate. 

"OK," said Tricia. "Give me ten minutes." 

She went up to her room. Apart from anything else, she had so 
little faith in the ability of the guy on the message desk at reception to 
deal with anything as complicated as a message that she wanted to 
be doubly certain that there wasn't a note under the door. It wouldn't 
be the first time that messages at the desk and messages under the 
door had been completely at odds with each other. 



There wasn't one. 

The message light on the phone was flashing though. 

She hit the message button and got the hotel operator. 

"You have a message from Gary Andress," said the operator. 

"Yes?" said Tricia. An unfamiliar name. "What does it say." 

"Not hippy," said the operator. 

"Not what?" said Tricia. 

"Hippy. What it says. Guy says he's not a hippy. I guess he wanted 
you to know that. You want the number?" 

As she started to dictate the number Tricia suddenly realised that 
this was just a garbled version of the message she had already had. 

"OK, OK," she said. "Are there any other messages for me?" 

"Room number?" 

Tricia couldn't work out why the operator should suddenly ask for 
her number this late in the conversation, but gave it to her anyway. 

"Name?" 

"McMillan, Tricia McMillan." Tricia spelt it, patiently. 

"Not Mr. MacManus?" 

"No." 

"No more messages for you." Click. 

Tricia sighed and dialled again. This time she gave her name and 
room number all over again, up front. The operator showed not the 
slightest glimmer of recognition that they had been speaking less than 
ten seconds ago. 

"I'm going to be in the bar," Tricia explained. "In the bar. If a phone 
call comes through for me, please would you put it through to me in 
the bar?" 

"Name?" 

They went through it all a couple more times till Tricia was certain 
that everything that possibly could be clear was as clear as it possibly 
could be. 

She showered, put on fresh clothes and retouched her makeup 
with the speed of a professional, and, looking at her bed with a sigh, 
left the room again. 

She had half a mind just to sneak off and hide. 



No. Not really. 

She had a look at herself in the mirror in the elevator lobby while 
she was waiting. She looked cool and in charge, and if she could fool 
herself she could fool anybody. 

She was just going to have to tough it out with Gail Andrews. OK, 
she had given her a hard time. Sorry but that's the game we're all in - 
that sort of thing. Ms. Andrews had agreed to do the interview 
because she had a new book out and TV exposure was free publicity. 
But there's no such thing as a free launch. No, she edited that line out 
again. 

What had happened was this: 

Last week astronomers had announced that they had at last 
discovered a tenth planet, out beyond the orbit of Pluto. They had 
been searching for it for years, Guided by certain orbital anomalies in 
the outer planets, and now they'd found it and they were all terribly 
pleased, and everyone was terribly happy for them and so on. The 
planet was named Persephone, but rapidly nicknamed Rupert after 
some astronomer's parrot - there was some tediously heart-warming 
story attached to this - and that was all very wonderful and lovely. 

Tricia had followed the story with, for various reasons, 
considerable interest. 

Then, while she had been casting around for a good excuse to go to 
New York at her TV company's expense she had happened to notice a 
press release about Gail Andrews, and her new book. You and Your 
Planets. 

Gail Andrews was not exactly a household name, but the moment 
you mentioned President Hudson, cream whips and the amputation 
of Damascus (the world had moved on from surgical strikes. The 
official term had in fact been "Damascectomy", meaning the "taking 
out" of Damascus), everyone remembered who you meant. 

Tricia saw an angle here which she quickly sold to her producer. 

Surely the notion that great lumps of rock whirling in space knew 
something about your day that you didn't must take a bit of a knock 
from the fact that there was suddenly a new lump of rock out there 
that nobody had known about before. 

That must throw a few calculations out, mustn't it? 



What about all those star charts and planetary motions and so? We 
all knew (apparently) what happened when Neptune was in Virgo, 
and so on, but what about when Rupert was rising? Wouldn't the 
whole of astrology have to be rethought? Wouldn't now perhaps be a 
good time to own up that it was all just a load of hogwash and instead 
take up pig-farming, the principles of which were founded on some 
kind of rational basis? If we'd known about Rupert three years ago, 
might President Hudson have been eating the boysenberry flavour on 
Thursday rather than Friday? Might Damascus still be standing? That 
sort of thing. 

Gail Andrews had taken it all reasonably well. She was just starting 
to recover from the initial onslaught, when she made the rather 
serious mistake of trying to shake Tricia off by talking smoothly about 
diurnal arcs, right ascensions and some of the more abstruse areas of 
three-dimensional trigonometry. 

To her shock she discovered that everything she delivered to Tricia 
came right back at her with more spin on it than she could cope with. 
Nobody had warned Gail that being a TV bimbo was, for Tricia, her 
second stab at a role in life. Behind her Chanel lip gloss, her coupe 
sauvage and her crystal blue contact lenses lay a brain that had 
acquired for itself, in an earlier, abandoned phase of her life, a first 
class degree in mathematics and a doctorate in astrophysics. 

As she was getting into the elevator Tricia, slightly preoccupied, 
realised she had left her bag in her room and wondered whether to 
duck back out and get it. No. It was probably safer where it was and 
there wasn't anything she particularly needed in it. She let the door 
close behind her. 

Besides, she told herself, taking a deep breath, if life had taught her 
anything it was this: Never go back for your bag. 

As the elevator went down she stared up at the ceiling in a rather 
intent way. Anyone who didn't know Tricia McMillan better would 
have said that that was exactly the way people sometimes stared 
upwards when they were trying to hold back tears. She must have 
been staring at the tiny security video camera mounted up in the 
corner. She marched rather briskly out of the elevator a minute later, 
and went up to the reception desk again. 



"Now, I'm going to write this out," she said, "because I don't want 
anything to go wrong." 

She wrote her name in large letters on a piece of paper, then her 
room number, then "IN THE BAR" and gave it to the receptionist, who 
looked at it. 

"That's in case there's a message for me. OK?" 

The receptionist continued to look at it. 

"You want me to see if she's in her room?" he said. 

Two minutes later, Tricia swivelled into the bar seat next to Gail 
Andrews, who was sitting in front of a glass of white wine. 

"You struck me as the sort of person who preferred to sit up at the 
bar rather than demurely at a table," she said. 

This was true, and caught Tricia a little by surprise. 

"Vodka?" said Gail. 

"Yes," said Tricia, suspiciously. She just stopped herself asking, 

"How did you know?" but Gail answered anyway. 

"I asked the barman," she said, with a kindly smile. 

The barman had her vodka ready for her and slid it charmingly 
across the glossy mahogany. 

"Thank you," said Tricia, stirring it sharply. 

She didn't know quite what to make out of all this sudden niceness 
and was determined not to be wrong-footed by it. People in New York 
were not nice to each other without reason. 

"Ms. Andrews," she said, firmly, "I'm sorry that you're not happy. I 
know you probably feel I was a bit rough with you this morning, but 
astrology is, after all, just popular entertainment, which is fine. It's 
part of showbiz and it's a part that you have done well out of and 
good luck to you. It's fun. It's not a science though, and it shouldn't be 
mistaken for one. I think that's something we both managed to 
demonstrate very successfully together this morning, while at the 
same time generating some popular entertainment, which is what we 
both do for a living. I'm sorry if you have a problem with that." 

"I'm perfectly happy," said Gail Andrews. 

"Oh," said Tricia, not quite certain what to make of this. "It said in 
your message that you were not happy." 



"No," said Gail Andrews. "I said in my message that I thought you 
were not happy, and I was just wondering why." 

Tricia felt as if she had been kicked in the back of the head. She 
blinked. 

"What?" she said quietly. 

"To do with the stars. You seemed very angry and unhappy about 
something to do with stars and planets when we were having our 
discussion, and it's been bothering me, which is why I came to see if 
you were all right." 

Tricia stared at her. "Ms. Andrews - " she started, and then 
realised that the way she had said it sounded exactly angry and 
unhappy and rather undermined the protest she had been trying to 
make. 

"Please call me Gail, if that's OK." 

Tricia just looked bewildered. 

"I know that astrology isn't a science," said Gail. "Of course it isn't. 
It's just an arbitrary set of rules like chess or tennis or, what's that 
strange thing you British play?" 

"Er, cricket? Self-loathing?" 

"Parliamentary democracy. The rules just kind of got there. They 
don't make any kind of sense except in terms of themselves. But 
when you start to exercise those rules, all sorts of processes start to 
happen and you start to find out all sorts of stuff about people. In 
astrology the rules happen to be about stars and planets, but they 
could be about ducks and drakes for all the difference it would make. 
It's just a way of thinking about a problem which lets the shape of 
that problem begin to emerge. The more rules, the tinier the rules, 
the more arbitrary they are, the better. It's like throwing a handful of 
fine graphite dust on a piece of paper to see where the hidden 
indentations are. It lets you see the words that were written on the 
piece of paper above it that's now been taken away and hidden. The 
graphite's not important. It's just the means of revealing their 
indentations. So you see, astrology's nothing to do with astronomy. 
It's just to do with people thinking about people. 

"So when you got so, I don't know, so emotionally focused on stars 
and planets this morning, I began to think, she's not angry about 
astrology, she really is angry and unhappy about actual stars and 



planets. People usually only get that unhappy and angry when they've 
lost something. That's all I could think and I couldn't make any more 
sense of it than that. So I came to see if you were OK." 

Tricia was stunned. 

One part of her brain had already got started on all sorts of stuff. It 
was busy constructing all sorts of rebuttals to do with how ridiculous 
newspaper horoscopes were and the sort of statistical tricks they 
played on people. But gradually it petered out, because it realised 
that the rest of her brain wasn't listening. She had been completely 
stunned. 

She had just been told, by a total stranger, something she'd kept 
completely secret for seventeen years. 

She turned to look at Gail. 

M | n 

She stopped. 

A tiny security camera up behind the bar had turned to follow her 
movement. This completely flummoxed her. Most people would not 
have noticed it. It was not designed to be noticed. It was not designed 
to suggest that nowadays even an expensive and elegant hotel in New 
York couldn't be sure that its clientele wasn't suddenly going to pull a 
gun or not wear a tie. But carefully hidden though it was behind the 
vodka, it couldn't deceive the finely honed instinct of a TV anchor 
person, which was to know exactly when a camera was turning to 
look at her. 

"Is something wrong?" asked Gail. 

"No, I... I have to say that you've rather astonished me," said Tricia. 
She decided to ignore the security camera. It was just her imagination 
playing tricks with her because she had television so much on her 
mind today. It wasn't the first time it had happened. A traffic 
monitoring camera, she was convinced, had swung round to follow 
her as she walked past it, and a security camera in Bloomingdales had 
seemed to make a particular point of watching her trying on hats. She 
was obviously going dotty. She had even imagined that a bird in 
Central Park had been peering at her rather intently. 

She decided to put it out of her mind and took a sip of her vodka. 
Someone was walking round the bar asking people if they were Mr. 
MacManus. 



"OK," she said, suddenly blurting it out. "I don't know how you 
worked it out, but..." 

"I didn't work it out, as you put it. I just listened to what you were 
saying." 

"What I lost, I think, was a whole other life." 

"Everybody does that. Every moment of every day. Every single 
decision we make, every breath we draw, opens some doors and 
closes many others. Most of them we don't notice. Some we do. 
Sounds like you noticed one." 

"Oh yes, I noticed," said Tricia. "All right. Here it is. It's very simple. 
Many years ago I met a guy at a party. He said he was from another 
planet and did I want to go along with him. I said, yes, OK. It was that 
kind of party. I said to him to wait while I went to get my bag and then 
I'd be happy to go off to another planet with him. He said I wouldn't 
need my bag. I said he obviously came from a very backward planet or 
he'd know that a woman always needed to take her bag with her. He 
got a bit impatient, but I wasn't gong to be a complete pushover just 
because he said he was from another planet. 

"I went upstairs. Took me a while to find my bag, and then there 
was someone else in the bathroom. Came down and he was gone." 

Tricia paused. 

"And...?" said Gail. 

"The garden door was open. I went outside. There were lights. 

Some kind of gleaming thing. I was just in time to see it rise up into 
the sky, shoot silently up through the clouds and disappear. That was 
it. End of story. End of one life, beginning of another. But hardly a 
moment of this life goes by that I don't wonder about some other me. 
A me that didn't go back for her bag. I feel like she's out there 
somewhere and I'm walking in her shadow." 

A member of the hotel staff was now going round the bar asking 
people if they were Mr. Miller. Nobody was. 

"You really think this... person was from another planet?" asked 
Gail. 

"Oh, certainly. There was the spacecraft. Oh, and also he had two 
heads." 

"Two? Didn't anybody else notice?" 

"It was a fancy dress party." 



"I see..." 

"And he had a bird cage over it, of course. With a cloth over the 
cage. Pretended he had a parrot. He tapped on the cage and it did a 
lot of stupid '"Pretty Polly"' stuff and squawking and so on. Then he 
pulled the cloth back for a moment and roared with laughter. There 
was another head in there, laughing along with him. It was a worrying 
moment I can tell you." 

"I think you probably did the right thing, dear, don't you?" said Gail. 

"No," said Tricia. "No I don't. And I couldn't carry on doing what I 
was doing either. I was an astrophysicist, you see. You can't be an 
astrophysicist properly if you've actually met someone from another 
planet who's got a second head that pretends to be a parrot. You just 
can't do it. I couldn't at least." 

"I can see it would be hard. And that's probably why you tend to be 
a little hard on other people who talk what sounds like complete 
nonsense." 

"Yes," said Tricia. "I expect you're right. I'm sorry." 

"That's OK." 

"You're the first person I've ever told this, by the way." 

"I wondered. You married?" 

"Er, no. So hard to tell these days isn't it? But you're right to ask 
because that was probably the reason. I came very close a few times, 
mostly because I wanted to have a kid. But every guy ended up asking 
why I was constantly looking over his shoulder. What do you tell 
someone? At one point I even thought I might just go to a sperm bank 
and take pot luck. Have somebody's child at random." 

"You can't seriously do that, can you?" 

Tricia laughed. "Probably not. I never quite went and found out for 
real. Never quite did it. Story of my life. Never quite did the real thing. 
That's why I'm in television I guess. Nothing is real." 

"Excuse me lady, your name Tricia McMillan?" 

Tricia looked round in surprise. There was a man standing there in 
a chauffeur's hat. 

"Yes," she said, instantly pulling herself back together again. 

"Lady, I been looking for you for about an hour. Hotel said they 
didn't have anybody of that name, but I checked back with Mr. 



Martin's office and they said that this was definitely where you 
staying. So I ask again, they still say they never heard of you, so I get 
them to page you anyway and they can't find you. In the end I get the 
office to FAX a picture of you through to the car and have a look 
myself." 

He looked at his watch. 

"May be a bit late now, but do you want to go anyway?" 

Tricia was stunned. 

"Mr. Martin? You mean Andy Martin at NBS?" 

"That's correct, lady. Screen test for US/AM." 

Tricia shot up out of her seat. She couldn't even bear to think of all 
the messages she'd heard for Mr. MacManus and Mr. Miller. 

"Only we have to hurry," said the chauffeur. "As I heard it Mr. 
Martin thinks it might be worth trying a British accent. His boss at the 
network is dead against the idea. That's Mr. Zwingler, and I happen to 
know he's flying out to the coast this evening because I'm the one has 
to pick him up and take him to the airport." 

"OK," said Tricia, "I'm ready. Let's go." 

"OK, lady. It's the big limo out the front." 

Tricia turned back to Gail. "I'm sorry," she said. 

"Go! Go!" said Gail. "And good luck. I've enjoyed meeting you." 

Tricia made to reach for her bag for some cash. 

"Damn," she said. She'd left it upstairs. 

"Drinks are on me," insisted Gail. "Really. It's been very 
interesting." 

Tricia sighed. 

"Look, I'm really sorry about this morning and..." 

"Don't say another word. I'm fine. It's only astrology. It's harmless. 
It's not the end of the world." 

"Thanks." On an impulse Tricia gave her a hug. 

"You got everything?" said the chauffeur. "You don't want to pick 
up your bag or anything?" 

"If there's one thing that life's taught me," said Tricia, "it's never go 
back for your bag." 



Just a little over an hour later, Tricia sat on one of the pair of beds 
in her hotel room. For a few minutes she didn't move. She just stared 
at her bag, which was sitting innocently on top of the other bed. 

In her hand was a note from Gail Andrews, saying, "Don't be too 
disappointed. Do ring if you want to talk about it. If I were you I'd stay 
in at home tomorrow night. Get some rest. But don't mind me, and 
don't worry. It's only astrology. It's not the end of the world. Gail." 

The chauffeur had been dead right. In fact the chauffeur seemed to 
know more about what was going on inside NBS than any other single 
person she had encountered in the organisation. Martin had been 
keen, Zwingler had not. She had had her one shot at proving Martin 
right and she had blown it. 

Oh well. Oh well, oh well, oh well. 

Time to go home. Time to phone the airline and see if she could 
still get the red-eye back to Heathrow, tonight. She reached for the 
big phone directory. 

Oh. First things first. 

She put down the directory again, picked up her handbag, and took 
it through to the bathroom. She put it down and took out the small 
plastic case which held her contact lenses, without which she had 
been unable properly to read either the script or the autocue. 

As she dabbed each tiny plastic cup into her eyes she reflected that 
if there was one thing life had taught her it was that there are times 
when you do not go back for your bag and other times when you do. 

It had yet to teach her to distinguish between the two types of 


occasion. 



Chapter 3 


The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has, in what we laughingly call 
the past, had a great deal to say on the subject of parallel universes. 
Very little of this is, however, at all comprehensible to anyone below 
the level of Advanced God, and since it is now well-established that all 
known gods came into existence a good three millionths of a second 
after the Universe began rather than, as they usually claimed, the 
previous week, they already have a great deal of explaining to do as it 
is, and are therefore not available for comment on matters of deep 
physics at this time. 

One encouraging thing the Guide does have to say on the subject 
of parallel universes is that you don't stand the remotest chance of 
understanding it. You can therefore say "What?" and "Eh?" and even 
go cross-eyed and start to blither if you like without any fear of 
making a fool of yourself. 

The first thing to realise about parallel universes, the Guide says, is 
that they are not parallel. 

It is also important to realise that they are not, strictly speaking, 
universes either, but it is easiest if you try and realise that a little later, 
after you've realised that everything you've realised up to that 
moment is not true. 

The reason they are not universes is that any given universe is not 
actually a thing as such, but is just a way of looking at what is 
technically known as the WSOGMM, or Whole Sort of General Mish 
Mash. The Whole Sort of General Mish Mash doesn't actually exist 
either, but is just the sum total of all the different ways there would 
be of looking at it if it did. 

The reason they are not parallel is the same reason that the sea is 
not parallel. It doesn't mean anything. You can slice the Whole Sort of 
General Mish Mash any way you like and you will generally come up 
with something that someone will call home. 

Please feel free to blither now. 



The Earth with which we are here concerned, because of its 
particular orientation in the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash, was 
hit by a neutrino that other Earths were not. 

A neutrino is not a big thing to be hit by. 

In fact it's hard to think of anything much smaller by which one 
could reasonably hope to be hit. And it's not as if being hit by 
neutrinos was in itself a particularly unusual event for something the 
size of the Earth. Far from it. It would be an unusual nanosecond in 
which the Earth was not hit by several billion passing neutrinos. 

It all depends on what you mean by "hit", of course, seeing as 
matter consists almost entirely of nothing at all. The chances of a 
neutrino actually hitting something as it travels through all this 
howling emptiness are roughly comparable to that of dropping a ball 
bearing at random from a cruising 747 and hitting, say, an egg 
sandwich. 

Anyway, this neutrino hit something. Nothing terribly important in 
the scale of things, you might say. But the problem with saying 
something like that is that you would be talking cross-eyed badger 
spit. Once something actually happens somewhere in something as 
wildly complicated as the Universe, Kevin knows where it will all end 
up - where "Kevin" is any random entity that doesn't know nothin' 
about nothin'. 

This neutrino struck an atom. 

The atom was part of a molecule. The molecule was part of a 
nucleic acid. The nucleic acid was part of a gene. The gene was part of 
a genetic recipe for growing... and so on. The upshot was that a plant 
ended up growing an extra leaf. In Essex. Or what would, after a lot of 
palaver and local difficulties of a geological nature, become Essex. 

The plant was a clover. It threw its weight, or rather its seed, 
around extremely effectively and rapidly became the world's 
dominant type of clover. The precise causal connection between this 
tiny biological happenstance, and a few other minor variations that 
exist in that slice of the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash - such as 
Tricia McMillan failing to leave with Zaphod Beeblebrox, abnormally 
low sales of pecan-flavoured ice-cream and the fact that the Earth on 
which all this occurred did not get demolished by the Vogons to make 
way for a new hyperspace bypass - is currently sitting at number 



4,763,984,132 on the research project priority list at what was once 
the History Department of the University of MaxiMegalon, and no 
one currently at the prayer meeting by the poolside appears to feel 
any sense of urgency about the problem. 



Chapter 4 


Tricia began to feel that the world was conspiring against her. She 
knew that this was a perfectly normal way to feel after an overnight 
flight going east, when you suddenly have a whole other mysteriously 
threatening day to deal with for which you are not the least bit 
prepared. But still. 

There were marks on her lawn. 

She didn't really care about marks on her lawn very much. Marks 
on her lawn could go and take a running jump as far as she was 
concerned. It was Saturday morning. She had just got home from New 
York feeling tired, crabby and paranoid, and all she wanted to do was 
go to bed with the radio on quietly and gradually fall asleep to the 
sound of Ned Sherrin being terribly clever about something. 

But Eric Bartlett was not going to let her get away with not making 
a thorough inspection of the marks. Eric was the old gardener who 
came in from the village on Saturday mornings to poke around at her 
garden with a stick. He didn't believe in people coming in from New 
York first thing in the morning. Didn't hold with it. Went against 
nature. He believed in virtually everything else, though. 

"Probably them space aliens," he said, bending over and prod-ding 
at the edges of the small indentations with his stick. "Hear a lot about 
space aliens these days. I expect it's them." 

"Do you?" said Tricia, looking furtively at her watch. Ten minutes, 
she reckoned. Ten minutes she'd be able to stay standing up. Then 
she would simply keel over, whether she was in her bedroom or still 
out here in the garden. That was if she just had to stand. If she also 
had to nod intelligently and say "Do you?" from time to time, it might 
cut it down to five. 

"Oh yes," said Eric. "They come down here, land on your lawn, and 
then buzz off again, sometimes with your cat. Mrs. Williams at the 
Post Office, her cat - you know the ginger one? - it got abducted by 
space aliens. Course, they brought it back the next day but it were in a 



very odd mood. Kept prowling around all morning, and then falling 
asleep in the afternoon. Used to be the other way round, is the point. 
Sleep in the morning, prowl in the afternoon. Jet lag, you see, from 
being in an interplanetary craft." 

"I see," said Tricia. 

"They dyed it tabby, too, she says. These marks are exactly the sort 
of marks that their landing pods would probably make." 

"You don't think it's the lawn mower?" asked Tricia. 

"If the marks were more round, I'd say, but these are just off-round, 
you see. Altogether more alien in shape." 

"It's just that you mentioned the lawn mower was playing up and 
needed fixing or it might start gouging holes in the lawn." 

"I did say that. Miss Tricia, and I stand by what I said. I'm not saying 
it's not the lawn mower for definite, I'm just saying what seems to me 
more likely given the shapes of the holes. They come in over these 
trees, you see, in their landing pods..." 

"Eric...," said Tricia, patiently. 

"Tell you what, though. Miss Tricia," said Eric, "I will take a look at 
the mower, like I meant to last week, and leave you to get on with 
whatever you're wanting to." 

"Thank you, Eric," said Tricia. "I'm going to bed now, in fact. Help 
yourself to anything you want in the kitchen." 

"Thank you, Miss Tricia, and good luck to you," said Eric. He bent 
over and picked something from the lawn. 

"There," he said. "Three-leaf clover. Good luck you see." 

He peered at it closely to check that it was a real three-leaf clover 
and not just a regular four-leaf one that one of the leaves had fallen 
off. "If I were you, though. I'd watch for signs of alien activity in the 
area." He scanned the horizon keenly. "Particularly from over there in 
the Henley direction." 

"Thank you, Eric," said Tricia again. "I will." 

She went to bed and dreamt fitfully of parrots and other birds. In 
the afternoon she got up and prowled around restlessly, not certain 
what to do with the rest of the day, or indeed the rest of her life. She 
spent at least an hour dithering, trying to make up her mind whether 
to head up into town and go to Stavro's for the evening. This was the 
currently fashionable spot for high-flying media people, and seeing a 



few friends there might help her ease herself back into the swing of 
things. She decided at last she would go. It was good. It was fun there. 
She was very fond of Stavro himself, who was a Greek with a German 
father - a fairly odd combination. Tricia had been to the Alpha a 
couple of nights earlier, which was Stavro's original club in New York, 
now run by his brother Karl, who thought of himself as a German with 
a Greek mother. Stavro would be very happy to be told that Karl was 
making a bit of a pig's ear of running the New York club, so Tricia 
would go and make him happy. There was little love lost between 
Stavro and Karl Mueller. 

OK. That's what she would do. 

She then spent another hour dithering about what to wear. At last 
she settled on a smart little black dress she'd got in New York. She 
phoned a friend to see who was likely to be at the club that evening, 
and was told that it was closed this evening for a private wedding 
party. 

She thought that trying to live life according to any plan you 
actually work out is like trying to buy ingredients for a recipe from the 
supermarket. You get one of those trolleys which simply will not go in 
the direction you push it and end up just having to buy completely 
different stuff. What do you do with it? What do you do with the 
recipe? She didn't know. 

Anyway, that night an alien spacecraft landed on her lawn. 



Chapter 5 


She watched it coming in from over the Henley direction with mild 
curiosity at first, wondering what those lights were. Living, as she did, 
not a million miles from Heathrow, she was used to seeing lights in 
the sky. Not usually so late in the evening, or so low, though, which 
was why she was mildly curious. 

When whatever it was began to come closer and closer her 
curiosity began to turn to bemusement. 

"Hmmm," she thought, which was about as far as she could get 
with thinking. She was still feeling dopey and jet-lagged and the 
messages that one part of her brain was busy sending to another 
were not necessarily arriving on time or the right way up. She left the 
kitchen where she'd been fixing herself a coffee and went to open the 
back door which led out to the garden. She took a deep breath of cool 
evening air, stepped outside and looked up. 

There was something roughly the size of a large camper van parked 
about a hundred feet above her lawn. 

It was really there. Hanging there. Almost silent. 

Something moved deep inside her. 

Her arms dropped slowly down to her side. She didn't notice the 
scalding coffee slopping over her foot. She was hardly breathing as 
slowly, inch by inch, foot by foot, the craft came downwards. Its lights 
were playing softly over the ground as if probing and feeling it. They 
played over her. 

It seemed beyond all hope that she should be given her chance 
again. Had he found her? Had he come back? The craft dropped down 
and down until at last it had settled quietly on her lawn. It didn't look 
exactly like the one she had seen departing all those years ago, she 
thought, but flashing lights in the night sky are hard to resolve into 
clear shapes. 

Silence. 

Then a click and a hum. 



Then another click and another hum. Click hum, click hum. 

A doorway slid open, spilling light towards her across the lawn. 

She waited, tingling. 

A figure stood silhouetted in the light, then another, and another. 

Wide eyes blinked slowly at her. Hands were slowly raised in 
greeting. 

"McMillan?" a voice said at last, a strange, thin voice that managed 
the syllables with difficulty. "Tricia McMillan. Ms. Tricia McMillan?" 

"Yes," said Tricia, almost soundlessly. 

"We have been monitoring you." 

"M... monitoring? Me?" 

"Yes." 

They looked at her for a while, their large eyes moving up and 
down her very slowly. 

"You look smaller in real life," one said at last. 

"What?" said Tricia. 

"Yes." 

"I... I don't understand," said Tricia. She hadn't expected any of this, 
of course, but even for something she hadn't expected to begin with 
it wasn't going the way she expected. At last she said, 

"Are you... are you from... Zaphod?" 

This question seemed to cause a little consternation among the 
three figures. They conferred with each other in some skittering 
language of their own and then turned back to her. 

"We don't think so. Not as far as we know," said one. 

"Where is Zaphod?" said another, looking up into the night sky. 

"I... I don't know, said Tricia, helplessly. 

"Is it far from here? Which direction? We don't know." 

Tricia realised with a sinking heart that they had no idea who she 
was talking about. Or even what she was talking about. And she had 
no idea what they were talking about. She put her hopes tightly away 
again and snapped her brain back into gear. There was no point in 
being disappointed. She had to wake up to the fact that she had here 
the journalistic scoop of the century. What should she do? Go back 
into the house for a video camera? Wouldn't they just be gone when 



she got back? She was thoroughly confused as to strategy. Keep'em 
talking, she thought. Figure it out later. 

"You've been monitoring... me?" 

"All of you. Everything on your planet. TV. Radio. 
Telecommunications. Computers. Video circuitry. Warehouses." 

"What?" 

"Car parks. Everything. We monitor everything." 

Tricia stared at them. 

"That must be very boring, isn't it?" she blurted out. 

"Yes." 

"So why..." 

"Except..." 

"Yes? Except what?" 

"Game shows. We quite like game shows." 

There was a terribly long silence as Tricia looked at the aliens and 
the aliens looked at her. 

"There's something I would just like to get from indoors," said 
Tricia very deliberately. "Tell you what. Would you, or one of you, like 
to come inside with me and have a look?" 

"Very much," they all said, enthusiastically. All three of them stood, 
slightly awkwardly in her sitting room, as she hurried around picking 
up a video camera, a 35mm camera, a tape recorder, every recording 
medium she could grab hold of. They were all thin and, under 
domestic lighting conditions, a sort of dim purplish green. 

"I really won't be a second, guys," Tricia said, as she rummaged 
through some drawers for spare tapes and films. 

The aliens were looking at the shelves that held her CDs and her 
old records. One of them nudged one of the others very slightly. 

"Look," he said. "Elvis." 

Tricia stopped, and stared at them all over again. 

"You like Elvis?" she said. 

"Yes," they said. 

"Elvis Presley?" 

"Yes." 



She shook her head in bewilderment as she tried to stuff a new 
tape into her video camera. 

"Some of your people," said one of her visitors, hesitantly, "think 
that Elvis has been kidnapped by space aliens." 

"What?" said Tricia. "Has he?" 

"It is possible." 

"Are you telling me that you have kidnapped Elvis?" gasped Tricia. 
She was trying to keep cool enough not to foul up her equipment, but 
this was all almost too much for her. 

"No. Not us," said her guests. "Aliens. It is a very interesting 
possibility. We talk of it often." 

"I must get this down," Tricia muttered to herself. She checked her 
video was properly loaded and working now. She pointed the camera 
at them. She didn't put it up to her eye because she didn't want to 
freak them out. But she was sufficiently experienced to be able to 
shoot accurately from the hip. 

"OK," she said. "Now tell me slowly and carefully who you are. You 
first," she said to the one on the left. "What's your name?" 

"I don't know." 

"You don't know." 

"No." 

"I see," said Tricia. "And what about you other two?" 

"We don't know." 

"Good. OK. Perhaps you can tell me where you are from?" 

They shook their heads. 

"You don't know where you're from?" 

They shook their heads again. 

"So," said Tricia. "What are you... er..." 

She was floundering but, being a professional, kept the camera 
steady while she did it. 

"We are on a mission," said one of the aliens. 

"A mission? A mission to do what?" 

"We do not know." 

Still she kept the camera steady. 

"So what are you doing here on Earth, then?" 



"We have come to fetch you." 

Rock steady, rock steady. Could have been on a tripod. She 
wondered if she should be using a tripod, in fact. She wondered that 
because it gave her a moment or two to digest what they had just 
said. No, she thought, hand-held gave her more flexibility. She also 
thought. Help, what am I going to do? 

"Why," she asked, calmly, "have you come to fetch me?" 

"Because we have lost our minds." 

"Excuse me," said Tricia, "I'm going to have to get a tripod." 

They seemed happy enough to stand there doing nothing while 
Tricia quickly found a tripod and mounted the camera on it. Her face 
was completely immobile, but she did not have the faintest idea what 
was going on or what to think about it. 

"OK," she said, when she was ready. "Why..." 

"We liked your interview with the astrologer." 

"You saw it?" 

"We see everything. We are very interested in astrology. We like it. 
It is very interesting. Not everything is interesting. Astrology is 
interesting. What the stars tell us. What the stars foretell. We could 
do with some information like that." 

"But..." 

Tricia didn't know where to start. 

Own up, she thought. There's no point in trying to second guess 
any of this stuff. 

So she said, "But I don't know anything about astrology." 

"We do." 

"You do?" 

"Yes. We follow our horoscopes. We are very avid. We see all your 
newspapers and your magazines and are very avid with them. But our 
leader says we have a problem." 

"You have a leader?" 

"Yes." 

"What's his name?" 

"We do not know." 



"What does he say his name is, for Christ's sake? Sorry I'll need to 
edit that. What does he say his name is?" 

"He does not know." 

"So how do you all know he's the leader?" 

"He seized control. He said someone has to do something round 
here." 

"Ah!", said Tricia, seizing on a clue. "Where is 'here'?" 

"Rupert." 

"What?" 

"Your people call it Rupert. The tenth planet from your sun. We 
have settled there for many years. It is highly cold and uninteresting 
there. But good for monitoring." 

"Why are you monitoring us?" 

"It is all we know to do." 

"OK," said Tricia. "Right. What is the problem that your leader says 
you have?" 

"Triangulation." 

"I beg your pardon?" 

"Astrology is a very precise science. We know this." 

"Well..." said Tricia, then left it at that. 

"But it is precise for you here on Earth." 

"Ye... e... s..." She had a horrible feeling she was getting a vague 
glimmering of something. 

"So when Venus is rising in Capricorn, for instance, that is from 
Earth. How does that work if we are out on Rupert? What if the Earth 
is rising in Capricorn? It is hard for us to know. Amongst the things we 
have forgotten, which we think are many and profound, is 
trigonometry." 

"Let me get this straight," said Tricia. "You want me to come with 
you to... Rupert..." 

"Yes." 

"To recalculate your horoscopes for you to take account of the 
relative positions of Earth and Rupert?" 

"Yes." 


"Do I get an exclusive?" 



"Yes." 

"I'm your girl," said Tricia, thinking that at the very least she could 
sell it to the National Enquirer. 

As she boarded the craft that would take her off to the furthest 
limits of the Solar System, the first thing that met her eyes was a bank 
of video monitors across which thousands of images were sweeping. 

A fourth alien was sitting watching them, but was focused on one 
particular screen that held a steady image. It was a replay of the 
impromptu interview which Tricia had just conducted with his three 
colleagues. He looked up when he saw her apprehensively climbing in. 

"Good evening, Ms. McMillan," he said. "Nice camera work." 



Chapter 6 


Ford Prefect hit the ground running. The ground was about three 
inches further from the ventilation shaft than he remembered it so he 
misjudged the point at which he would hit the ground, started 
running too soon, stumbled awkwardly and twisted his ankle. Damn! 
He ran off down the corridor anyway, hobbling slightly. 

All over the building, alarms were erupting into their usual frenzy 
of excitement. He dived for cover behind the usual storage cabinets, 
glanced around to check that he was unseen, and started rapidly to 
fish around inside his satchel for the usual things he needed. 

His ankle, unusually, was hurting like hell. 

The ground was not only three inches further from the ventilation 
shaft than he remembered, it was also on a different planet than he 
remembered, but it was the three inches that had caught him by 
surprise. The offices of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy were 
quite often shifted at very short notice to another planet, for reasons 
of local climate, local hostility, power bills or tax, but they were 
always reconstructed exactly the same way, almost to the very 
molecule. For many of the company's employees, the layout of their 
offices represented the only constant they knew in a severely 
distorted personal universe. 

Something, though, was odd. 

This was not in itself surprising, thought Ford as he pulled out his 
lightweight throwing towel. Virtually everything in his life was, to a 
greater or lesser extent, odd. It was just that this was odd in a slightly 
different way than he was used to things being odd, which was, well, 
strange. He couldn't quite get it into focus immediately. 

He got out his No. 3 gauge prising tool. The alarms were going in 
the same old way that he knew well. There was a kind of music to 
them that he could almost hum along to. That was all very familiar. 
The world outside had been a new one on Ford. He had not been to 



Saquo-Pilia Hensha before, and he had liked it. It had a kind of 
carnival atmosphere to it. 

He took from his satchel a toy bow and arrow which he had bought 
in a street market. 

He had discovered that the reason for the carnival atmosphere on 
Saquo-Pilia Hensha was that the local people were celebrating the 
annual feast of the Assumption of St Antwelm. St Antwelm had been, 
during his lifetime, a great and popular king who had made a great 
and popular assumption. What King Antwelm had assumed was that 
what everybody wanted, all other things being equal, was to be happy 
and enjoy themselves and have the best possible time together. On 
his death he had willed his entire personal fortune to financing an 
annual festival to remind every one of this, with lots of good food and 
dancing and very silly games like Hunt the Wocket. His Assumption 
had been such a brilliantly good one that he was made into a saint for 
it. Not only that, but all the people who had previously been made 
saints for doing things like being stoned to death in a thoroughly 
miserable way or living upside down in barrels of dung were instantly 
demoted and were now thought to be rather embarrassing. 

The familiar H-shaped building of the Hitchhiker's Guide offices 
rose above the outskirts of the city, and Ford Prefect had broken into 
it in the familiar way. He always entered via the ventilation system 
rather than the main lobby because the main lobby was patrolled by 
robots whose job it was to quiz incoming employees about their 
expense accounts. Ford Prefect's expense accounts were notoriously 
complex and difficult affairs and he had found, on the whole, that the 
lobby robots were ill-equipped to understand the arguments he 
wished to put forward in relation to them. He preferred, therefore, to 
make his entrance by another route. 

This meant setting off nearly every alarm in the building, but not 
the one in the accounts department, which was the way that Ford 
preferred it. 

He hunkered down behind the storage cabinet, he licked the 
rubber suction cup of the toy arrow, and then fitted it to the string of 
the bow. 

Within about thirty seconds a security robot the size of a small 
melon came flying down the corridor at about waist height, scanning 
left and right for anything unusual as it did so. 



With impeccable timing Ford shot the toy arrow across its path. 

The arrow flew across the corridor and stuck, wobbling, on the 
opposite wall. As it flew, the robot's sensors locked on to it instantly 
and the robot twisted through ninety degrees to follow it, see what 
the hell it was and where it was going. 

This bought Ford one precious second, during which the robot was 
looking in the opposite direction from him. Fie hurled the towel over 
the flying robot and caught it. 

Because of the various sensory protuberances with which the robot 
was festooned, it couldn't manoeuvre inside the towel, and it just 
twitched back and forth without being able to turn and face its captor. 

Ford hauled it quickly towards him and pinned it down to the 
ground. It was beginning to whine pitifully. With one swift and 
practised movement. Ford reached under the towel with his No. 3 
gauge prising tool and flipped off the small plastic panel on top of the 
robot which gave access to its logic circuits. 

Now logic is a wonderful thing but it has, as the processes of 
evolution discovered, certain drawbacks. 

Anything that thinks logically can be fooled by something else 
which thinks at least as logically as it does. The easiest way to fool a 
completely logical robot is to feed it the same stimulus sequence over 
and over again so it gets locked in a loop. This was best demonstrated 
by the famous Flerring Sandwich experiments conducted millennia 
ago at MISPWOSO (The MaxiMegalon Institute of Slowly and Painfully 
Working Out the Surprisingly Obvious). 

A robot was programmed to believe that it liked herring 
sandwiches. This was actually the most difficult part of the whole 
experiment. Once the robot had been programmed to believe that it 
liked herring sandwiches, a herring sandwich was placed in front of it. 
Whereupon the robot thought to itself, "Ah! A herring sandwich! I like 
herring sandwiches." 

It would then bend over and scoop up the herring sandwich in its 
herring sandwich scoop, and then straighten up again. Unfortunately 
for the robot, it was fashioned in such a way that the action of 
straightening up caused the herring sandwich to slip straight back off 
its herring sandwich scoop and fall on to the floor in front of the robot. 
Whereupon the robot thought to itself, "Ah! A herring sandwich..., 
etc., and repeated the same action over and over and over again. The 



only thing that prevented the herring sandwich from getting bored 
with the whole damn business and crawling off in search of other 
ways of passing the time was that the herring sandwich, being just a 
bit of dead fish between a couple of slices of bread, was marginally 
less alert to what was going on than was the robot. 

The scientists at the Institute thus discovered the driving force 
behind all change, development and innovation in life, which was this: 
herring sandwiches. They published a paper to this effect, which was 
widely criticised as being extremely stupid. They checked their figures 
and realised that what they had actually discovered was "boredom", 
or rather, the practical function of boredom. In a fever of excitement 
they then went on to discover other emotions, Like "irritability", 
"depression", "reluctance", "ickiness" and so on. The next big 
breakthrough came when they stopped using herring sandwiches, 
whereupon a whole welter of new emotions became suddenly 
available to them for study, such as "relief", "joy", "friskiness", 
"appetite", "satisfaction", and most important of all, the desire for 
"happiness". 

This was the biggest breakthrough of all. 

Vast wodges of complex computer code governing robot behaviour 
in all possible contingencies could be replaced very simply. All that 
robots needed was the capacity to be either bored or happy, and a 
few conditions that needed to be satisfied in order to bring those 
states about. They would then work the rest out for themselves. 

The robot which Ford had got trapped under his towel was not, at 
the moment a happy robot. It was happy when it could move about. It 
was happy when it could see other things. It was particularly happy 
when it could see other things moving about, particularly if the other 
things were moving about doing things they shouldn't do because it 
could then, with considerable delight, report them. 

Ford would soon fix that. 

He squatted over the robot and held it between his knees. The 
towel was still covering all of its sensory mechanisms, but Ford had 
now got its logic circuits exposed. The robot was whirring grungily and 
pettishly, but it could only fidget, it couldn't actually move. Using the 
prising tool. Ford eased a small chip out from its socket. As soon as it 
came out, the robot went quiet and just sat there in a coma. 



The chip Ford had taken out was the one which contained the 
instructions for all the conditions that had to be fulfilled in order for 
the robot to feel happy. The robot would be happy when a tiny 
electrical charge from a point just to the left of the chip reached 
another point just to the right of the chip. The chip determined 
whether the charge got there or not. 

Ford pulled out a small length of wire that had been threaded into 
the towel. Fie dug one end of it into the top left hole of the chip 
socket and the other into the bottom right hole. 

That was all it took. Now the robot would be happy whatever 
happened. 

Ford quickly stood up and whisked the towel away. The robot rose 
ecstatically into the air, pursuing a kind of wriggly path. 

It turned and saw Ford. 

"Mr. Prefect, sir! I'm so happy to see you!" 

"Good to see you, little fella," said Ford. 

The robot rapidly reported back to its central control that 
everything was now for the best in this best of all possible worlds, the 
alarms rapidly quelled themselves, and life returned to normal. 

At least, almost to normal. 

There was something odd about the place. 

The little robot was gurgling with electric delight. Ford hurried on 
down the corridor, letting the thing bob along in his wake telling him 
how delicious everything was, and how happy it was to be able to tell 
him that. 

Ford, however, was not happy. 

Fie passed faces of people he didn't know. They didn't look like his 
sort of people. They were too well groomed. Their eyes were too 
dead. Every time he thought he saw someone he recognised in the 
distance, and hurried along to say hello, it would turn out to be 
someone else, with an altogether neater hairstyle and a much more 
thrusting, purposeful look than, well, than anybody Ford knew. 

A staircase had been moved a few inches to the left. A ceiling had 
been lowered slightly. A Lobby had been remodelled. All these things 
were not worrying in themselves, though they were a little 
disorienting. The thing that was worrying was the decor. It used to be 
brash and glitzy. Expensive - because the Guide sold so well through 



the civilised and post-civilised Galaxy - but expensive and fun. Wild 
games machines lined the corridors. Insanely painted grand pianos 
hung from ceilings, vicious sea creatures from the planet Viv reared 
up out of pools in tree-filled atria, robot butlers in stupid shirts 
roamed the corridors seeking whose hands they might press frothing 
drinks into. People used to have pet vastdragons on leads and 
pterospondes on perches in their offices. People knew how to have a 
good time, and if they didn't there were courses they could sign up 
for which would put that right. 

There was none of that now. 

Somebody had been through the place doing some iniquitous kind 
of taste job on it. 

Ford turned sharply into a small alcove, cupped his hand and 
yanked the flying robot in with him. He squatted down and peered at 
the burbling cybernaut. 

"What's been happening here?" he demanded. 

"Oh just the nicest things, sir, just the nicest possible things. Can I 
sit on your lap, please?" 

"No," said Ford, brushing the thing away. It was overjoyed to be 
spurned in this way and started to bob and burble and swoon. Ford 
grabbed it again and stuck it firmly in the air a foot in front of his face. 
It tried to stay where it was put but couldn't help quivering slightly. 

"Something's changed, hasn't it?" Ford hissed. 

"Oh yes," squealed the little robot, "in the most fabulous and 
wonderful way. I feel so good about it." 

"Well what was it like before, then?" 

"Scrumptious." 

"But you like the way it's changed?" demanded Ford. 

"I like everything," moaned the robot. "Especially when you shout 
at me like that. Do it again, please." 

"Just tell me what's happened!" 

"Oh thank you, thank you!" 

Ford sighed. 

"OK, OK," panted the robot. "The Guide has been taken over. 
There's a new management. It's all so gorgeous I could just melt. The 



old management was also fabulous of course, though I'm not sure if I 
thought so at the time." 

"That was before you had a bit of wire stuck in your head." 

"How true. How wonderfully true. How wonderfully, bubblingly, 
frothingly, burstingly true. What a truly ecstasy-inducingly correct 
observation." 

"What's happened?" insisted Ford. "Who is this new management? 
When did they take over? I... oh, never mind," he added, as the little 
robot started to gibbet with uncontrollable joy and rub itself against 
his knee. "I'll go and find out for myself." Ford hurled himself at the 
door of the editor-in-chief's office, tucked himself into a tight ball as 
the frame splintered and gave way, rolled rapidly across the floor to 
where the drinks trolley laden with some of the Galaxy's most potent 
and expensive beverages habitually stood, seized hold of the trolley 
and, using it to give himself cover, trundled it and himself across the 
main exposed part of the office floor to where the valuable and 
extremely rude statue of Leda and the Octopus stood, and took 
shelter behind it. Meanwhile the little security robot, entering at 
chest height, was suicidally delighted to draw gunfire away from Ford. 

That, at least, was the plan, and a necessary one. The current 
editor-in-chief, Stagyar-zil-Doggo, was a dangerously unbalanced man 
who took a homicidal view of contributing staff turning up in his office 
without pages of fresh, proofed copy, and had a battery of laser 
Guided guns linked to special scanning devices in the door frame to 
deter anybody who was merely bringing extremely good reasons why 
they hadn't written any. Thus was a high level of output maintained. 

Unfortunately the drinks trolley wasn't there. 

* * * 

Ford hurled himself desperately sideways and somersaulted 
towards the statue of Leda and the Octopus, which also wasn't there. 
He rolled and hurtled around the room in a kind of random panic, 
tripped, span, hit the window, which fortunately was built to 
withstand rocket attacks, rebounded, and fell in a bruised and winded 
heap behind a smart grey crushed leather sofa, which hadn't been 
there before. 

After a few seconds he slowly peeked up above the top of the sofa. 
As well as there being no drinks trolley and no Leda and the Octopus, 



there had also been a startling absence of gunfire. He frowned. This 
was all utterly wrong. 

"Mr. Prefect, I assume," said a voice. 

The voice came from a smooth-faced individual behind a large 
ceramo-teak-bonded desk. Stagyar-zil-Doggo may well have been a 
hell of an individual, but no one, for a whole variety of reasons, would 
ever have called him smooth-faced. This was not Stagyar-zil-Doggo. 

"I assume from the manner of your entrance that you do not have 
new material for the, er. Guide, at the moment," said the smooth¬ 
faced individual. He was sitting with his elbows resting on the table 
and holding his fingertips together in a manner which, inexplicably, 
has never been made a capital offence. 

"I've been busy," said Ford, rather weakly. He staggered to his feet, 
brushing himself down. Then he thought, what the hell was he saying 
things weakly for? He had to get on top of this situation. He had to 
find out who the hell this person was, and he suddenly thought of a 
way of doing it. 

"Who the hell are you?", he demanded. 

"lam your new editor-in-chief. That is, if we decide to retain your 
services. My name is Vann Harl." He didn't put his hand out. He just 
added, "What have you done to that security robot?" 

The little robot was rolling very, very slowly round the ceiling and 
moaning quietly to itself. 

"I've made it very happy," snapped Ford. "It's a kind of mission I 
have. Where's Stagyar? More to the point, where's his drinks trolley?" 

"Mr. zil-Doggo is no longer with this organisation. His drinks trolley 
is, I imagine, helping to console him for this fact." 

"Organisation?" yelled Ford. "Organisation? What a bloody stupid 
word for a set-up like this!" 

"Precisely our sentiments. Under-structured, overresourced, 
under-managed, over-inebriated. And that," said Harl, "was just the 
editor." 

"I'll do the jokes," snarled Ford. 

"No," said Harl. "You will do the restaurant column." 

He tossed a piece of plastic on to the desk in front of him. Ford did 
not move to pick it up. 



"You what?" said Ford. 

"No. Me Harl. You Prefect. You do restaurant column. Me editor. 
Me sit here tell you do restaurant column. You get?" 

"Restaurant column?" said Ford, too bewildered to be really angry 
yet. 

"Siddown, Prefect," said Harl. Fie swung round in his swivel chair, 
got to his feet, and stood staring out at the tiny specks enjoying the 
carnival twenty-three stories below. 

"Time to get this business on its feet, Prefect," he snapped. 

"We at InfiniDim Enterprises are..." 

"You at what?" 

"InfiniDim Enterprises. We have bought out the Guide." 

"InfiniDim?" 

"We spent millions on that name, Prefect. Start liking it or start 
packing." 

Ford shrugged. Fie had nothing to pack. 

"The Galaxy is changing," said Harl. "We've got to change with it. 
Go with the market. The market is moving up. New aspirations. New 
technology. The future is..." 

"Don't tell me about the future," said Ford. "I've been all over the 
future. Spend half my time there. It's the same as anywhere else. 
Anywhen else. Whatever. Just the same old stuff in faster cars and 
smellier air." 

"That's one future," said Harl. "That's your future, if you accept it. 
You've got to learn to think multi-dimensionally. There are limitless 
futures stretching out in every direction from this moment-and from 
this moment and from this. Billions of them, bifurcating every instant 
Every possible position of every possible electron balloons out into 
billions of probabilities! Billions and billions of shining, gleaming 
futures! You know what that means?" 

"You're dribbling down your chin." 

"Billions and billions of markets!" 

"I see," said Ford. "So you sell billions and billions of Guides." 

"No," said Harl, reaching for his handkerchief and not finding one. 
"Excuse me," he said, "but this gets me so excited." Ford handed him 
his towel. 



"The reason we don't sell billions and billions of Guides," continued 
Harl, after wiping his mouth, "is the expense. What we do is we sell 
one Guide billions and billions of times. We exploit the 
multidimensional nature of the Universe to cut down on 
manufacturing costs. And we don't sell to penniless hitchhikers. What 
a stupid notion that was! Find the one section of the market that, 
more or less by definition, doesn't have any money, and try and sell to 
it. No. We sell to the affluent business traveller and his vacationing 
wife in a billion, billion different futures. This is the most radical, 
dynamic and thrusting business venture in the entire 
multidimensional infinity of space/time/probability ever." 

"And you want me to be its restaurant critic," said Ford. 

"We would value your input." 

"Kill!" shouted Ford. Fie shouted it at his towel. 

The towel leapt up out of Flarl's hands. 

This was not because it had any motive force of its own, but 
because Flarl was so startled at the idea that it might. The next thing 
that startled him was the sight of Ford Prefect hurtling across the 
desk at him fists first. In fact Ford was just lunging for the credit card, 
but you don't get to occupy the sort of position that Flarl occupied in 
the sort of organisation in which Flarl occupied it without developing 
a healthily paranoid view of life. Fie took the sensible precaution of 
hurling himself backwards, and striking his head a sharp blow on the 
rocket-proof glass, then subsided into a series of worrying and highly 
personal dreams. 

Ford lay on the desk, surprised at how swimmingly everything had 
gone. Fie glanced quickly at the piece of plastic he now held in his 
hand - it was a Dine-O-Charge credit card with his name already 
embossed on it, and an expiry date two years from now, and was 
possibly the single most exciting thing Ford had ever seen in his life - 
then he clambered over the desk to see to Flarl. 

Fie was breathing fairly easily. It occurred to Ford that he might 
breathe more easily yet without the weight of his wallet bearing 
down on his chest, so he slipped it out of Flarl's breast pocket and 
flipped through it. Fair amount of cash. Credit tokens. Ultragolf club 
membership. Other club memberships. Photos of someone's wife and 
family - presumably Flarl's, but it was hard to be sure these days. 



Busy executives often didn't have time for a full-time wife and family 
and would just rent them for weekends. 

Ha! 

He couldn't believe what he'd just found. 

He slowly drew out from the wallet a single and insanely exciting 
piece of plastic that was nestling amongst a bunch of receipts. 

It wasn't insanely exciting to look at. It was rather dull in fact. It 
was smaller and a little thicker than a credit card and semi¬ 
transparent. If you held it up to the light you could see a lot of 
holographically encoded information and images buried pseudo¬ 
inches deep beneath its surface. 

It was an Ident-i-Eeze, and was a very naughty and silly thing for 
Harl to have lying around in his wallet, though it was perfectly 
understandable. There were so many different ways in which you 
were required to provide absolute proof of your identity these days 
that life could easily become extremely tiresome just from that factor 
alone, never mind the deeper existential problems of trying to 
function as a coherent consciousness in an epistemologically 
ambiguous physical universe. Just look at cash point machines, for 
instance. Queues of people standing around waiting to have their 
fingerprints read, their retinas scanned, bits of skin scraped from the 
nape of the neck and undergoing instant (or nearly instant - a good 
six or seven seconds in tedious reality) genetic analysis, then having to 
answer trick questions about members of their family they didn't 
even remember they had, and about their recorded preferences for 
tablecloth colours. And that was just to get a bit of spare cash for the 
weekend. If you were trying to raise a loan for a jetcar, sign a missile 
treaty or pay an entire restaurant bill things could get really trying. 

Hence the Ident-i-Eeze. This encoded every single piece of 
information about you, your body and your life into one all-purpose 
machine-readable card that you could then carry around in your 
wallet, and therefore represented technology's greatest triumph to 
date over both itself and plain common sense. 

Ford pocketed it. A remarkably good idea had just occurred to him. 
He wondered how long Harl would remain unconscious. 

"Hey!" he shouted to the little melon-sized robot still slobbering 
with euphoria up on the ceiling. "You want to stay happy?" 



The robot gurgled that it did. 

"Then stick with me and do everything I tell you without fail." 

The robot said that it was quite happy where it was up on the 
ceiling thank you very much. It had never realised before how much 
sheer titillation there was to be got from a good ceiling and it wanted 
to explore its feelings about ceilings in greater depth. 

"You stay there," said Ford, "and you'll soon be recaptured and 
have your conditional chip replaced. You want to stay happy, come 
now." 

The robot let out a long heartfelt sigh of impassioned tristesse and 
sank reluctantly away from the ceiling. 

"Listen," said Ford, "can you keep the rest of the security system 
happy for a few minutes?" 

"One of the joys of true happiness," trilled the robot, "is sharing. I 
brim, I froth, I overflow with..." 

"OK," said Ford. "Just spread a little happiness around the security 
network. Don't give it any information. Just make it feel good so it 
doesn't feel the need to ask for any." 

Fie picked up his towel and ran cheerfully for the door. Life had 
been a little dull of late. It showed every sign now of becoming 
extremely froody. 



Chapter 7 


Arthur Dent had been in some hell-holes in his life, but he had 
never before seen a spaceport which had a sign saying, "Even 
travelling despondently is better than arriving here." To welcome 
visitors the arrivals hall featured a picture of the President of 
NowWhat, smiling. It was the only picture anybody could find of him, 
and it had been taken shortly after he had shot himself so although 
the photo had been retouched as well as could be managed the smile 
it wore was rather a ghastly one. The side of his head had been drawn 
back in crayon. No replacement had been found for the photograph 
because no replacement had been found for the President. There was 
only one ambition which anyone on the planet ever had, and that was 
to leave. 

Arthur checked himself into a small motel on the outskirts of town, 
and sat glumly on the bed, which was damp, and flipped through the 
little information brochure, which was also damp. It said that the 
planet of NowWhat had been named after the opening words of the 
first settlers to arrive there after struggling across light years of space 
to reach the furthest unexplored outreaches of the Galaxy. The main 
town was called OhWell. There weren't any other towns to speak of. 
Settlement on NowWhat had not been a success and the sort of 
people who actually wanted to live on NowWhat were not the sort of 
people you would want to spend time with. 

Trading was mentioned in the brochure. The main trade that was 
carried out was in the skins of the NowWhattian boghog but it wasn't 
a very successful one because no one in their right minds would want 
to buy a NowWhattian boghog skin. The trade only hung on by its 
fingernails because there was always a significant number of people 
in the Galaxy who were not in their right minds. Arthur had felt very 
uncomfortable looking around at some of the other occupants of the 
small passenger compartment of the ship. 

The brochure described some of the history of the planet. Whoever 
had written it had obviously started out trying to drum up a little 



enthusiasm for the place by stressing that it wasn't actually cold and 
wet all the time, but could find little positive to add to this so the tone 
of the piece quickly degenerated into savage irony. 

It talked about the early years of settlement. It said that the major 
activities pursued on NowWhat were those of catching, skinning and 
eating NowWhattian boghogs, which were the only extant form of 
animal life on NowWhat, all other having long ago died of despair. 

The boghogs were tiny, vicious creatures, and the small margin by 
which they fell short of being completely inedible was the margin by 
which life on the planet subsisted. So what were the rewards, 
however small, that made life on NowWhat worth living? Well, there 
weren't any. Not a one. Even making yourself some protective 
clothing out of boghog skins was an exercise in disappointment and 
futility, since the skins were unaccountably thin and leaky. This 
caused a lot of puzzled conjecture amongst the settlers. What was the 
boghog's secret of keeping warm? If anyone had ever learnt the 
language the boghogs spoke to each other they would have 
discovered that there was no trick. The boghogs were as cold and wet 
as anyone else on the planet. No one had had the slightest desire to 
learn the language of the boghogs for the simple reason that these 
creatures communicated by biting each other very hard on the thigh. 
Life on NowWhat being what it was, most of what a boghog might 
have to say about it could easily be signified by these means. 

Arthur flipped through the brochure till he found what he was 
looking for. At the back there were a few maps of the planet. They 
were fairly rough and ready because they weren't likely to be of much 
interest to anyone, but they told him what he wanted to know. 

He didn't recognise it at first because the maps were the other way 
up from the way he would have expected and looked, therefore 
thoroughly unfamiliar. Of course, up and down, north and south, are 
absolutely arbitrary designations, but we are used to seeing things the 
way we are used to seeing them, and Arthur had to turn the maps 
upside-down to make sense of them. 

There was one huge landmass off on the upper left-hand side of 
the page which tapered down to a tiny waist and then ballooned out 
again like a large comma. On the right-hand side was a collection of 
large shapes jumbled familiarly together. The outlines were not 
exactly the same, and Arthur didn't know if this was because the map 



was so rough, or because the sea-level was higher or because, well, 
things were just different here. But the evidence was inarguable. 

This was definitely the Earth. 

Or rather, it most definitely was not. 

It merely looked a lot like the Earth and occupied the same 
coordinates in space/time. What co-ordinates it occupied in 
Probability was anybody's guess. 

He sighed. 

This, he realised, was about as close to home as he was likely to get. 
Which meant that he was about as far from home as he could 
possibly be. Glumly he slapped the brochure shut and wondered what 
on earth he was going to do next. 

He allowed himself a hollow laugh at what he had just thought. He 
looked at his old watch, and shook it a bit to wind it. It had taken him, 
according to his own time-scale, a year of hard travelling to get here. 

A year since the accident in hyperspace in which Fenchurch had 
completely vanished. One minute she had been sitting there next to 
him in the SlumpJet; the next minute the ship had done a perfectly 
normal hyperspace hop and when he had next looked she was not 
there. The seat wasn't even warm. Her name wasn't even on the 
passenger list. 

The spaceline had been wary of him when he had complained. A lot 
of awkward things happen in space travel, and a lot of them make a 
lot of money for lawyers. But when they had asked him what Galactic 
Sector he and Fenchurch had been from and he had said ZZ9 Plural Z 
Alpha they had relaxed completely in a way that Arthur wasn't at all 
sure he liked. They even laughed a little, though sympathetically, of 
course. They pointed to the clause in the ticket contract which said 
that the entities whose lifespans had originated in any of the Plural 
zones were advised not to travel in hyperspace and did so at their 
own risk. Every-body, they said, knew that. They tittered slightly and 
shook their heads. 

As Arthur had left their offices he found he was trembling slightly. 
Not only had he lost Fenchurch in the most complete and utter way 
possible, but he felt that the more time he spent away out in the 
Galaxy the more it seemed that the number of things he didn't know 
anything about actually increased. 



Just as he was lost for a moment in these numb memories a knock 
came on the door of his motel room, which then opened immediately. 
A fat and dishevelled man came in carrying Arthur's one small case. 

He got as far as, "Where shall I put - " when there was a sudden 
violent flurry and he collapsed heavily against the door, trying to beat 
off a small and mangy creature that had leapt snarling out of the wet 
night and buried its teeth in his thigh, even through the thick layers of 
leather padding he wore there. There was a brief, ugly confusion of 
jabbering and thrashing. The man shouted frantically and pointed. 
Arthur grabbed a hefty stick that stood next to the door expressly for 
this purpose and beat at the boghog with it. 

The boghog suddenly disengaged and limped backwards, dazed 
and forlorn. It turned anxiously in the corner of the room, its tail 
tucked up right under its back legs, and stood looking nervously up at 
Arthur, jerking its head awkwardly and repeatedly to one side. Its jaw 
seemed to be dislocated. It cried a little and scraped its damp tail 
across the floor. By the door, the fat man with Arthur's suitcase was 
sitting and cursing, trying to staunch the flow of blood from his thigh. 
His clothes were already wet from the rain. 

Arthur stared at the boghog, not knowing what to do. The boghog 
looked at him questioningly. It tried to approach him, waking 
mournful little whimpering noises. It moved its jaw pain-fully. It made 
a sudden leap for Arthur's thigh, but its dislocated jaw was too weak 
to get a grip and it sank, whining sadly, down to the floor. The fat man 
jumped to his feet, grabbed the stick, beat the boghog's brains into a 
sticky, pulpy mess on the thin carpet, and then stood there breathing 
heavily as if daring the animal to move again, just once. 

A single boghog eyeball sat looking reproachfully at Arthur from 
out of the mashed ruins of its head. 

"What do you think it was trying to say?" asked Arthur in a small 
voice. 

"Ah, nothing much," said the man "Just its way of trying to be 
friendly. This is just our way of being friendly back," he added, 
gripping the stick. 

"When's the next flight out?" asked Arthur. 

"Thought you'd only just arrived," said the man. 



"Yes," said Arthur. "It was only going to be a brief visit. I just 
wanted to see if this was the right place or not. Sorry." 

"You mean you're on the wrong planet?" said the man lugubriously. 
"Funny how many people say that. Specially the people who live 
here." He eyed the remains of the boghog with a deep, ancestral 
resentment. 

"Oh no," said Arthur, "it's the right planet all right." He picked up 
the damp brochure lying on the bed and put it in his pocket. "It's OK, 
thanks, I'll take that," he said, taking his case from the man. He went 
to the door and looked out into the cold, wet night. 

"Yes, it's the right planet, all right," he said again. "Right planet, 
wrong universe." 

A single bird wheeled in the sky above him as he set off back for 
the spaceport. 



Chapter 8 


Ford had his own code of ethics. It wasn't much of one, but it was 
his and he stuck by it, more or less. One rule he made was never to 
buy his own drinks. He wasn't sure if that counted as an ethic, but you 
have to go with what you've got. He was also firmly and utterly 
opposed to all and any forms of cruelty to any animals whatsoever 
except geese. And furthermore he would never steal from his 
employers. 

Well, not exactly steal. 

If his accounts supervisor didn't start to hyperventilate and put out 
a seal-all-exits security alert when Ford handed in his expenses claim 
then Ford felt he wasn't doing his job properly. But actually stealing 
was another thing. That was biting the hand that feeds you. Sucking 
very hard on it, even nibbling it in an affectionate kind of a way was 
OK, but you didn't actually bite it. Not when that hand was the Guide. 
The Guide was something sacred and special. 

But that, thought Ford as he ducked and weaved his way down 
through the building, was about to change. And they had only 
themselves to blame. Look at all this stuff. Lines of neat grey office 
cubicles and executive workstation pods. The whole place was dreary 
with the hum of memos and minutes of meetings flitting through its 
electronic networks. Out in the street they were playing Hunt the 
Wocket for Zark's sake, but here in the very heart of the Guide offices 
no one was even recklessly kicking a ball around the corridors or 
wearing inappropriately coloured beachware. 

"InfiniDim Enterprises," Ford snarled to himself as he stalked 
rapidly down one corridor after another. Door after door magically 
opened to him without question. Elevators took him happily to places 
they should not. Ford was trying to pursue the most tangled and 
complicated route he could, heading generally down-wards through 
the building. His happy little robot took care of everything, spreading 
waves of acquiescent joy through all the security circuits it 
encountered. 



Ford thought it needed a name and decided to call it Emily 
Saunders, after a girl he had very fond memories of. Then he thought 
that Emily Saunders was an absurd name for a security robot, and 
decided to call it Colin instead, after Emily's dog. 

He was moving deep into the bowels of the building now, into 
areas he had never entered before, areas of higher and higher 
security. He was beginning to encounter puzzled looks from the 
operatives he passed. At this level of security you didn't even call 
them people anymore. And they were probably doing stuff that only 
operatives would do. When they went home to their families in the 
evening they became people again, and when their little children 
looked up to them with their sweet shining eyes and said "Daddy, 
what did you do all day today?" they just said, "I performed my duties 
as an operative," and left it at that. 

The truth of the matter was that all sorts of highly dodgy stuff went 
on behind the cheery, happy-go-lucky front that the Guide liked to 
put up - or used to like to put up before this new InfiniDim 
Enterprises bunch marched in and started to make the whole thing 
highly dodgy. There were all kinds of tax scams and rackets and graft 
and shady deals supporting the shining edifice, and down in the 
secure research and data-processing levels of the building was where 
it all went on. 

Every few years the Guide would set up its business, and indeed its 
building on a new world, and all would be sunshine and laughter for a 
while as the Guide would put down its roots in the local culture and 
economy, provide employment, a sense of glamour and adventure 
and, in the end, not quite as much actual revenue as the locals had 
expected. 

When the Guide moved on, taking its building with it, it left a little 
like a thief in the night. Exactly like a thief in the night in fact. It 
usually left in the very early hours of the morning, and the following 
day there always turned out to be a very great deal of stuff missing. 
Whole cultures and economies would collapse in its wake, often 
within a week, leaving once thriving planets desolate and shell¬ 
shocked but still somehow feeling they had been part of some great 
adventure. 

The "operatives" who shot puzzled glances at Ford as he marched 
on into the depths of the building's most sensitive areas were 



reassured by the presence of Colin, who was flying along with him in a 
buzz of emotional fulfilment and easing his path for him at every 
stage. 

Alarms were starting to go off in other parts of the building. 

Perhaps that meant that Vann Harl had already been discovered, 
which might be a problem. Ford had been hoping he would be able to 
slip the Ident-i-Eeze back into his pocket before he came round. Well, 
that was a problem for later, and he didn't for the moment have the 
faintest idea how he was going to solve it. For the moment he wasn't 
going to worry. Wherever he went with little Colin, he was 
surrounded by a cocoon of sweetness and light and, most importantly, 
willing and acquiescent elevators and positively obsequious doors. 

Ford even began to whistle, which was probably his mistake. 

Nobody likes a whistler, particularly not the divinity that shapes our 
ends. 

The next door wouldn't open. 

And that was a pity, because it was the very one that Ford had 
been making for. It stood there before him, grey and resolutely closed 
with a sign on it saying: 

NO ADMITTANCE. 

NOT EVEN TO AUTHORISED PERSONNEL. 

YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME HERE. 

GO AWAY. 


Colin reported that the doors had been getting generally a lot 
grimmer down in these lower reaches of the building. 

They were about ten stories below ground level now. The air was 
refrigerated and the tasteful grey hessian wall-weave had given way 
to brutal grey bolted steel walls. Colin's rampant euphoria had 
subsided into a kind of determined cheeriness. He said that he was 
beginning to tire a little. It was taking all his energy to pump the 
slightest bonhomie whatsoever into the doors down here. 

Ford kicked at the door. It opened. 

"Mixture of pleasure and pain," he muttered. "Always does the 
trick." 



He walked in and Colin flew in after him. Even with a wire stuck 
straight into his pleasure electrode his happiness was a nervous kind 
of happiness. He bobbed around a little. 

The room was small, grey and humming. 

This was the nerve centre of the entire Guide. 

The computer terminals that lined the grey walls were windows on 
to every aspect of the Guide's operations. Here, on the left-hand side 
of the room, reports were gathered over the Sub-Etha-Net from field 
researchers in every corner of the Galaxy, fed straight up into the 
network of sub-editor's offices where they had all the good bits cut 
out by secretaries because the sub-editors were out having lunch. The 
remaining copy would then be shot across to the other half of the 
building - the other leg of the "H" - which was the legal department. 
The legal department would cut out anything that was still even 
remotely good from what remained and fire it back to the offices of 
the executive editors, who were also out at lunch. So the editors 
secretaries would read it and say it was stupid and cut most of what 
was left. 

When any of the editors finally staggered in from lunch they would 
exclaim "What is this feeble crap that X" - where X was the name of 
the field researcher in question - "has sent us from half-way across 
the bloody Galaxy? What's the point of having somebody spending 
three whole orbital periods out in the bloody Gagrakacka Mind Zones, 
with all that stuff going on out there, if this load of anaemic squitter is 
the best he can be bothered to send us. Disallow his expenses!" 

"What shall we do with the copy?" the secretary would ask. 

"Ah, put it out over the network. Got to have something going out 
there. I've got a headache. I'm going home." 

So the edited copy would go for one last slash and burn through 
the legal department, and then be sent back down here where it 
would be broadcast out over the Sub-Etha-Net for instantaneous 
retrieval anywhere in the Galaxy. That was handled by equipment 
which was monitored and controlled by the terminals on the right- 
hand side of the room. 

Meanwhile the order to disallow the researcher's expenses was 
relayed down to the computer terminal stuck off in the right-hand 
corner, and it was to this terminal that Ford Prefect now swiftly made 
his way. 



(If you are reading this on planet Earth then: 

a) Good luck to you. There is an awful lot of stuff you don't know 
anything about, but you are not alone in this. It's just that in your case 
the consequences of not knowing any of this stuff are particularly 
terrible, but then, hey, that's just the way the cookie gets completely 
stomped on and obliterated. 

b) Don't imagine you know what a computer terminal is. 

A computer terminal is not some clunky old television with a 
typewriter in front of it. It is an interface where the mind and body 
can connect with the universe and move bits of it about.) 

Ford hurried over to the terminal, sat in front of it and quickly 
dipped himself into its universe. 

It wasn't the normal universe he knew. It was a universe of densely 
enfolded worlds, of wild topographies, towering mountain peaks, 
heart stopping ravines, of moons shattering off into sea horses, 
hurtful blurting crevices, silently heaving oceans and bottomless 
hurtling hooping funts. 

He held still to get his bearings. He controlled his breathing, closed 
his eyes and looked again. 

So this was where accountants spent their time. There was clearly 
more to them than met the eye. He looked around carefully, trying 
not to let it all swell and swim and overwhelm him. 

He didn't know his way around this universe. He didn't even know 
the physical laws that determined its dimensional extents or 
behaviours, but his instinct told him to look for the most outstanding 
feature he could detect and make towards it. 

Way off in some indistinguishable distance - was it a mile or a 
million or a mote in his eye? - was a stunning peak that overarched 
the sky, climbed and climbed and spread out in flowering aigrettes3, 
agglomerates4, and arch imandrites5. 

He weltered towards it, hooling and thurling, and at last reached it 
in a meaninglessly long umthingth of time. 

He clung to it, arms outspread, gripping tightly on to its roughly 
gnarled and pitted surface. Once he was certain that he was secure he 
made the hideous mistake of looking down. 

While he had been weltering, hooling and thurling, the distance 
beneath him had not bothered him unduly, but now that he was 



gripping, the distance made his heart wilt and his brain bend. His 
fingers were white with pain and tension. His teeth were grinding and 
twisting against each other beyond his control. His eyes turned 
inwards with waves from the willowing extremities of nausea. 

With an immense effort of will and faith he simply let go and 
pushed. 

He felt himself float. Away. And then, counter-intuitively, upwards. 
And upwards. 

He threw his shoulders back, let his arms drop, gazed upwards and 
let himself be drawn loosely, higher and higher. 

Before long, insofar as such terms had any meaning in this virtual 
universe, a ledge loomed up ahead of him on which he could grip and 
on to which he could clamber. 

He rose, he gripped, he clambered. 

He panted a little. This was all a little stressful. 

He held tightly on to the ledge as he sat. He wasn't certain if this 
was to prevent himself from falling down off it or rising up from it, but 
he needed something to grip on to as he surveyed the world in which 
he found himself. 

The whirling, turning height span him and twisted his brain in upon 
itself till he found himself, eyes closed, whimpering and hugging the 
hideous wall of towering rock. 

He slowly brought his breathing back under control again. He told 
himself repeatedly that he was just in a graphic representation of a 
world. A virtual universe. A simulated reality. He could snap back out 
of it at any moment. 

He snapped back out of it. 

He was sitting in a blue leatherette foam filled swivel-seated office 
chair in front of a computer terminal. 

He relaxed. 

He was clinging to the face of an impossibly high peak perched on a 
narrow ledge above a drop of brain-swivelling dimensions. 

It wasn't just the landscape being so far beneath him - he wished it 
would stop undulating and waving. 



He had to get a grip. Not on the rock wall - that was an illusion. He 
had to get a grip on the situation, be able to look at the physical world 
he was in while drawing himself out of it emotionally. 

He clenched inwardly and then, just as he had let go of the rock 
face itself, he let go of the idea of the rock face and let himself just sit 
there clearly and freely. He looked out at the world. He was breathing 
well. He was cool. He was in charge again. 

He was in a four-dimensional topological model of the Guide's 
financial systems, and somebody or something would very shortly 
want to know why. 

And here they came. 

Swooping through virtual space towards him came a small flock of 
mean and steely-eyed creatures with pointy little heads, pencil 
moustaches and querulous demands as to who he was, what he was 
doing there, what his authorisation was, what the authorisation of his 
authorising agent was, what his inside leg measurement was and so 
on. Laser light flickered all over him as if he was a packet of biscuits at 
a supermarket check-out. The heavier duty laser guns were held, for 
the moment, in reserve. The fact that all of this was happening in 
virtual space made no difference. Being virtually killed by a virtual 
laser in virtual space is just as effective as the real thing, because you 
are as dead as you think you are. 

The laser readers were becoming very agitated as they flickered 
over his fingerprints, his retina and the follicle pattern where his hair 
line was receding. They didn't like what they were finding at all. The 
chattering and screeching of highly personal and insolent questions 
was rising in pitch. A little surgical steel scraper was reaching out 
towards the skin at the nape of his neck when Ford, holding his 
breath and praying very slightly, pulled Vann Harl's Ident-i-Eeze out of 
his pocket and waved it in front of them. 

Instantly every laser was diverted to the little card and Swept 
backwards and forwards over it and in it, examining and reading every 
molecule. 

Then, just as suddenly, they stopped. 

The entire flock of little virtual inspectors snapped to attention. 

"Nice to see you, Mr. Harl," they said in smarmy unison. "Is there 
anything we can do for you?" 



Ford smiled a slow and vicious smile. 


"Do you know," he said, "I rather think there is?" Five minutes later 
he was out of there. 

About thirty seconds to do the job, and three minutes thirty to 
cover his tracks. Fie could have done anything he liked in the virtual 
structure, more or less. Fie could have transferred ownership of the 
entire organisation into his own name, but he doubted if that would 
have gone unnoticed. Fie didn't want it anyway. It would have meant 
responsibility, working late nights at the office, not to mention 
massive and time-consuming fraud investigations and a fair amount 
of time in jail. Fie wanted something that nobody other than the 
computer would notice: that was the bit that took thirty seconds. 

The thing that took three minutes thirty was programming the 
computer not to notice that it had noticed anything. 

It had to want not to know about what Ford was up to, and then he 
could safely leave the computer to rationalise its own defences 
against the information ever emerging. It was a programming 
technique that had been reverse-engineered from the sort of 
psychotic mental blocks that otherwise perfectly normal people had 
been observed invariably to develop when elected to high political 
office. 

The other minute was spent discovering that the computer system 
already had a mental block. A big one. 

Fie would never have discovered it if he hadn't been busy 
engineering a mental block himself. Fie came across a whole slew of 
smooth and plausible denial procedures and diversionary subroutines 
exactly where he had been planning to install his own. The computer 
denied all knowledge of them, of course, then blankly refused to 
accept that there was anything even to deny knowledge of, and was 
generally so convincing that even Ford almost found himself thinking 
he must have made a mistake. 

Fie was impressed. 

Fie was so impressed, in fact, that he didn't bother to install his 
own mental block procedures, he just set up calls to the ones that 
were already there, which then called themselves when questioned, 
and so on. 



He quickly set about debugging the little bits of code he had 
installed himself, only to discover they weren't there. Cursing, he 
searched all over for them, but could find no trace of them at all. 

He was just about to start installing them all over again when he 
realised that the reason he couldn't find them was that they were 
working already. 

He grinned with satisfaction. 

He tried to discover what the computer's other mental block was 
all about, but it seemed, not unnaturally, to have a mental block 
about it. He could no longer find any trace of it at all, in fact; it was 
that good. He wondered if he had been imagining it. He wondered if 
he had been imagining that it was something to do with something in 
the building, and something to do with the number 13. He ran a few 
tests. Yes, he had obviously been imagining it. 

No time for fancy routes now, there was obviously a major security 
alert in progress. Ford took the elevator up to the ground floor to 
change to the express elevators. He had somehow to get the Ident-i- 
Eeze back into Harl's pocket before it was missed. How, he didn't 
know. 

The doors of the elevator slid open to reveal a large posse of 
security guards and robots poised waiting for it and brandishing filthy 
looking weapons. 

They ordered him out. 

With a shrug he stepped forward. They all pushed rudely past him 
into the elevator which took them down to continue their search for 
him on the lower levels. 

This was fun, thought Ford, giving Colin a friendly pat. Colin was 
about the first genuinely useful robot Ford had ever encountered. 
Colin bobbed along in the air in front of him in a lather of cheerful 
ecstasy. Ford was glad he'd named him after a dog. 

He was highly tempted just to leave at that point and hope for the 
best, but he knew that the best had a far greater chance of actually 
occurring if Harl did not discover that his Ident-i-Eeze was missing. He 
had somehow, surreptitiously, to return it. 

They went to the express elevators. 

"Hi," said the elevator they got into. 



"Hi," said Ford. 

"Where can I take you folks today?" said the elevator. 

"Floor 23," said Ford. 

"Seems to be a popular floor today," said the elevator. 

"Hmm," thought Ford, not liking the sound of that at all. The 
elevator lit up the twenty-third floor on its floor display and started to 
zoom upwards. Something about the floor display tweaked at Ford's 
mind but he couldn't catch what it was and forgot about it. He was 
more worried about the idea of the floor he was going to being a 
popular one. He hadn't really thought through how he was going to 
deal with whatever it was that was happening up there because he 
had no idea what he was going to find. He would just have to busk it. 

They were there. 

The doors slid open. 

Ominous quiet. 

Empty corridor. 

There was the door to Harl's office, with a slight layer of dust 
around it. Ford knew that this dust consisted of billions of tiny 
molecular robots that had crawled out of the woodwork, built each 
other, rebuilt the door, disassembled each other and then crept back 
into the woodwork again and just waited for damage. Ford wondered 
what kind of life that was, but not for long because he was a lot more 
concerned about what his own life was like at that moment. 

He took a deep breath and started his run. 



Chapter 9 


Arthur felt at a bit of a loss. There was a whole Galaxy of stuff out 
there for him, and he wondered if it was churlish of him to complain 
to himself that it lacked just two things: the world he was born on and 
the woman he loved. 

Damn it and blast it, he thought, and felt the need of some 
guidance and advice. He consulted the Hitchhiker's Guide to the 
Galaxy. He looked up "guidance" and it said "See under ADVICE". He 
looked up "advice" and it said "see under GUIDANCE". It had been 
doing a lot of that kind of stuff recently and he wondered if it was all 
it was cracked up to be. 

He headed to the outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy where, it was 
said, wisdom and truth were to be found, most particularly on the 
planet Hawalius, which was a planet of oracles and seers and 
soothsayers and also take-away pizza shops, because most mystics 
were completely incapable of cooking for themselves. 

However it appeared that some sort of calamity had befallen this 
planet. As Arthur wandered the streets of the village where the major 
prophets lived, it had something of a crestfallen air. He came across 
one prophet who was clearly shutting up shop in a despondent kind 
of way and asked him what was happening. 

"No call for us any more," he said gruffly as he started to bang a 
nail into the plank he was holding across the window of his hovel. 

"Oh? Why's that?" 

"Hold on to the other end of this and I'll show you." 

Arthur held up the unnailed end of the plank and the old prophet 
scuttled into the recesses of his hovel, returning a moment or two 
later with a small Sub-Etha radio. He turned it on, fiddled with the dial 
for a moment and put the thing on the small wooden bench that he 
usually sat and prophesied on. He then took hold of the plank again 
and resumed hammering. 

Arthur sat and listened to the radio. 



"...be confirmed/' said the radio. 

"Tomorrow," it continued, "the Vice-President of Poffla Vigus, 

Roopy Ga Stip, will announce that he intends to run for President. In a 
speech he will give tomorrow at..." 

"Find another channel," said the prophet. Arthur pushed the preset 
button. 

"...refused to Comment," said the radio. "Next week's jobless totals 
in the Zabush sector, it continued, "will be the worst since records 
began. A report published next month says..." 

"Find another," barked the prophet, crossly. Arthur pushed the 
button again. 

"...denied it categorically," said the radio. "Next month's Royal 
Wedding between Prince Gid of the Soofling Dynasty and Princess 
Hooli of Raui Alpha will be the most spectacular ceremony the Bjanjy 
Territories has ever witnessed. Our reporter Trillian Astra is there and 
sends us this report." 

Arthur blinked. 

The sound of cheering crowds and a hubbub of brass bands 
erupted from the radio. A very familiar voice said, "Well Krart, the 
scene here in the middle of next month is absolutely incredible. 
Princess Hooli is looking radiant in a..." 

The prophet swiped the radio off the bench and on to the dusty 
ground, where it squawked like a badly tuned chicken. 

"See what we have to contend with?" grumbled the prophet. "Flere, 
hold this. Not that, this. No, not like that. This way up. Other way 
round, you fool." 

"I was listening to that," complained Arthur, grappling helplessly 
with the prophet's hammer. 

"So does everybody. That's why this place is like a ghost town." Fie 
spat into the dust. 

"No, I mean, that sounded like someone I knew." 

"Princess Hooli? If I had to stand around saying hello to everybody 
who's known Princess Hooli I'd need a new set of lungs." 

"Not the Princess," said Arthur. "The reporter. Fler name's Trillian. I 
don't know where she got the Astra from. She's from the same planet 
as me. I wondered where she'd got to." 



"Oh, she's all over the continuum these days. We can't get the tri-d 
TV stations out here of course, thank the Great Green Arkleseizure, 
but you hear her on the radio, gallivanting here and there through 
space/time. She wants to settle down and find herself a steady era 
that young lady does. It'll all end in tears. Probably already has." He 
swung with his hammer and hit his thumb rather hard. He started to 
speak in tongues. 

The village of oracles wasn't much better. 

He had been told that when looking for a good oracle it was best to 
find the oracle that other oracles went to, but he was shut. There was 
a sign by the entrance saying, "I just don't know any more. Try next 
door (r), but that's just a suggestion, not formal oracular advice." 

"Next door" was a cave a few hundred yards away and Arthur 
walked towards it. Smoke and steam were rising from, respectively, a 
small fire and a battered tin pot that was hanging over it. There was 
also a very nasty smell coming from the pot. At least Arthur thought it 
was coming from the pot. The distended bladders of some of the local 
goat-like things were hanging from a propped-up line drying in the 
sun, and the smell could have been coming from them. There was 
also, a worryingly small distance away, a pile of discarded bodies of 
the local goat-like things and the smell could have been coming from 
them. 

But the smell could just as easily have been coming from the old 
lady who was busy beating flies away from the pile of bodies. It was a 
hopeless task because each of the flies was about the size of a winged 
bottle top and all she had was a table tennis bat. Also she seemed half 
blind. Every now and then, by chance, her wild thrashing would 
connect with one of the flies with a richly satisfying thunk, and the fly 
would hurtle through the air and smack itself open against the rock 
face a few yards from the entrance to her cave. 

She gave every impression, by her demeanour, that these were the 
moments she lived for. 

Arthur watched this exotic performance for a while from a polite 
distance, and then at last tried giving a gentle cough to attract her 
attention. The gentle cough, courteously meant, unfortunately 
involved first inhaling rather more of the local atmosphere than he 
had so far been doing and as a result, he erupted into a fit of raucous 



expectoration, and collapsed against the rock face, choking and 
streaming with tears. He struggled for breath, but each new breath 
made things worse. He vomited, half-choked again, rolled over his 
vomit, kept rolling for a few yards, and eventually made it up on to his 
hands and knees and crawled, panting, into slightly fresher air. 

"Excuse me," he said. He got some breath back. "I really am most 
dreadfully sorry. I feel a complete idiot and..." He gestured helplessly 
towards the small pile of his own vomit lying spread around the 
entrance to her cave. 

"What can I say?" he said. "What can I possibly say?" 

This at least had gained her attention. She looked round at him 
suspiciously, but, being half blind, had difficulty finding him in the 
blurred and rocky landscape. 

He waved, helpfully. "Hello!" he called. 

At last she spotted him, grunted to herself and turned back to 
whacking flies. 

It was horribly apparent from the way that currents of air moved 
when she did, that the major source of the smell was in fact her. The 
drying bladders, the festering bodies and the noxious potage may all 
have been making violent contributions to the atmosphere, but the 
major olfactory presence was the woman herself. 

She got another good thwack at a fly. It smacked against the rock 
and dribbled its insides down it in what she clearly regarded, if she 
could see that far, as a satisfactory manner. 

Unsteadily, Arthur got to his feet and brushed himself down with a 
fistful of dried grass. He didn't know what else to do by way of 
announcing himself. He had half a mind just to wander off again, but 
felt awkward about leaving a pile of his vomit in front of the entrance 
to the woman's home. He wondered what to do about it. He started 
to pluck up more handsful of the scrubby dried grass that was to be 
found here and there. He was worried, though, that if he ventured 
nearer to the vomit he might simply add to it rather than clear it up. 

Just as he was debating with himself as to what the right course of 
action was he began to realise that she was at last saying something 
to him. 

"I beg your pardon?" he called out. 



"I said, can I help you?" she said, in a thin, scratchy voice, that he 
could only just hear. 

"Er, I came to ask your advice," he called back, feeling a bit 
ridiculous. 

She turned to peer at him, myopically, then turned back, swiped at 
a fly and missed. 

"What about?" she said. 

"I beg your pardon?" he said. 

"I said, what about?" she almost screeched. 

"Well," said Arthur. "Just sort of general advice, really. It said in the 
brochure -" 

"Ha! Brochure!" spat the old woman. She seemed to be waving her 
bat more or less at random now. 

Arthur fished the crumpled-up brochure from his pocket. He wasn't 
quite certain why. He had already read it and she, he expected, 
wouldn't want to. He unfolded it anyway in order to have something 
to frown thoughtfully at for a moment or two. The copy in the 
brochure wittered on about the ancient mystical arts of the seers and 
sages of Hawalius, and wildly over-represented the level of 
accommodation available in Hawalion. Arthur still carried a copy of 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy with him but found, when he 
consulted it, that the entries were becoming more abstruse and 
paranoid and had lots of x's and j's and's in them. Something was 
wrong somewhere. Whether it was in his own personal unit, or 
whether it was something or someone going terribly amiss, or 
perhaps just hallucinating, at the heart of the Guide organisation itself, 
he didn't know. But one way or another he was even less inclined to 
trust it than usual, which meant that he trusted it not one bit, and 
mostly used it for eating his sandwiches off when he was sitting on a 
rock staring at something. 

The woman had turned and was walking slowly towards him now. 
Arthur tried, without making it too obvious, to judge the wind 
direction, and bobbed about a bit as she approached. 

"Advice," she said. "Advice, eh?" 

"Er, yes," said Arthur. "Yes, that is - " 

He frowned again at the brochure, as if to be certain that he hadn't 
misread it and stupidly turned up on the wrong planet or something. 



The brochure said "The friendly local inhabitants will be glad to share 
with you the knowledge and wisdom of the ancients. Peer with them 
into the swirling mysteries of past and future time!" There were some 
coupons as well, but Arthur had been far too embarrassed actually to 
cut them out or try to present them to anybody. 

"Advice, eh," said the old woman again. "Just sort of general advice, 
you say. On what? What to do with your life, that sort of thing?" 

"Yes," said Arthur. "That sort of thing. Bit of a problem I sometimes 
find if I'm being perfectly honest." He was trying desperately, with 
tiny darting movements, to stay upwind of her. She surprised him by 
suddenly turning sharply away from him and heading off towards her 
cave. 

"You'll have to help me with the photocopier, then," she said. 

"What?" said Arthur. 

"The photocopier," she repeated, patiently. "You'll have to help me 
drag it out. It's solar-powered. I have to keep it in the cave, though, so 
the birds don't shit on it." 

"I see," said Arthur. 

"I'd take a few deep breaths if I were you," muttered the old 
woman, as she stomped into the gloom of the cave mouth. 

Arthur did as she advised. He almost hyperventilated in fact. When 
he felt he was ready, he held his breath and followed her in. 

The photocopier was a big old thing on a rickety trolley. It stood 
just inside the dim shadows of the cave. The wheels were stuck 
obstinately in different directions and the ground was rough and 
stony. 

"Go ahead and take a breath outside," said the old woman. Arthur 
was going red in the face trying to help her move the thing. 

He nodded in relief. If she wasn't going to be embarrassed about it 
then neither, he was determined, would he. He stepped outside and 
took a few breaths, then came back in to do more heaving and 
pushing. He had to do this quite a few times till at last the machine 
was outside. 

The sun beat down on it. The old woman disappeared back into her 
cave again and brought with her some mottled metal panels, which 
she connected to the machine to collect the sun's energy. 



She squinted up into the sky. The sun was quite bright, but the day 
was hazy and vague. 

"It'll take a while," she said. 

Arthur said he was happy to wait. 

The old woman shrugged and stomped across to the fire. Above it, 
the contents of the tin can were bubbling away. She poked about at 
them with a stick. 

"You won't be wanting any lunch?" she enquired of Arthur. 

"I've eaten, thanks," said Arthur. "No, really. I've eaten." 

"I'm sure you have," said the old lady. She stirred with the stick. 
After a few minutes she fished a lump of something out, blew on it to 
cool it a little, and then put it in her mouth. 

She chewed on it thoughtfully for a bit. 

Then she hobbled slowly across to the pile of dead goat-like things. 
She spat the lump out on to the pile. She hobbled slowly back to the 
can. She tried to unhook it from the sort of tripod-like thing that it 
was hanging from. 

"Can I help you?" said Arthur, jumping up politely. He hurried over. 

Together they disengaged the tin from the tripod and carried it 
awkwardly down the slight slope that led downwards from her cave 
and towards a line of scrubby and gnarled trees, which marked the 
edge of a steep but quite shallow gully, from, which a whole new 
range of offensive smells was emanating. 

"Ready?" said the old Lady. 

"Yes..." said Arthur, though he didn't know for what. 

"One," said the old lady. 

"Two," she said. 

"Three," she added. 

Arthur realised just in time what she intended. Together they 
tossed the contents of the tin into the gully. 

After an hour or two of uncommunicative silence, the old woman 
decided that the solar panels had absorbed enough sunlight to run 
the photocopier now and she disappeared to rummage inside her 
cave. She emerged at last with a few sheaves of paper and fed them 
through the machine. 

She handed the copies to Arthur. 



"This is, er, this your advice then, is it?" said Arthur, leafing through 
them uncertainly. 

"No," said the old lady. "It's the story of my life. You see, the 
quality of any advice anybody has to offer has to be judged against 
the quality of life they actually lead. Now, as you look through this 
document you'll see that I've underlined all the major decisions I ever 
made to make them stand out. They're all indexed and cross- 
referenced. See? All I can suggest is that if you take decisions that are 
exactly opposite to the sort of decisions that I've taken, then maybe 
you won't finish up at the end of your life..." she paused, and filled 
her lungs for a good shout,"... in a smelly old cave like this!" 

She grabbed up her table tennis bat, rolled up her sleeve, stomped 
off to her pile of dead goat-like things, and started to set about the 
flies with vim and vigour. 

The last village Arthur visited consisted entirely of extremely high 
poles. They were so high that it wasn't possible to tell, from the 
ground, what was on top of them, and Arthur had to climb three 
before he found one that had anything on top of it at all other than a 
platform covered with bird droppings. 

Not an easy task. You went up the poles by climbing on the short 
wooden pegs that had been hammered into them in slowly ascending 
spirals. Anybody who was a less diligent tourist than Arthur would 
have taken a couple of snapshots and sloped right off to the nearest 
Bar & Grill, where you also could buy a range of particularly sweet 
and gooey chocolate cakes to eat in front of the ascetics. But, largely 
as a result of this, most of the ascetics had gone now. In fact they had 
mostly gone and set up lucrative therapy centres on some of the 
more affluent worlds in the North West ripple of the Galaxy, where 
the living was easier by a factor of about seventeen million, and the 
chocolate was just fabulous. Most of the ascetics, it turned out, had 
not known about chocolate before they took up asceticism. Most of 
the clients who came to their therapy centres knew about it all too 
well. 

At the top of the third pole Arthur stopped for a breather. He was 
very hot and out of breath, since each pole was about fifty or sixty 
feet high. The world seemed to swing vertiginously around him, but it 
didn't worry Arthur too much. He knew that, logically, he could not 



die until he had been to Stavromula Beta6, and had therefore 
managed to cultivate a merry attitude towards extreme personal 
danger. He felt a little giddy perched fifty feet up in the air on top of a 
pole, but he dealt with it by eating a sandwich. He was just about to 
embark on reading the photocopied life history of the oracle, when he 
was rather startled to hear a slight cough behind him. 

He turned so abruptly that he dropped his sandwich, which turned 
downwards through the air and was rather small by the time it was 
stopped by the ground. 

About thirty feet behind Arthur was another pole, and, alone 
amongst the sparse forest of about three dozen poles, the top of it 
was occupied. It was occupied by an old man who, in turn, seemed to 
be occupied by profound thoughts that were making him scowl. 

"Excuse me," said Arthur. The man ignored him. Perhaps he 
couldn't hear him. The breeze was moving about a bit. It was only by 
chance that Arthur had heard the slight cough. 

"Hello?" called Arthur. "Hello!" 

The man at last glanced round at him. He seemed surprised to see 
him. Arthur couldn't tell if he was surprised and pleased to see him or 
just surprsised. 

"Are you open?" called Arthur. 

The man frowned in incomprehension. Arthur couldn't tell if he 
couldn't understand or couldn't hear. 

"I'll pop over," called Arthur. "Don't go away." 

He clambered off the small platform and climbed quickly down the 
spiralling pegs, arriving at the bottom quite dizzy. 

He started to make his way over to the pole on which the old man 
was sitting, and then suddenly realised that he had disoriented 
himself on the way down and didn't know for certain which one it was. 

He looked around for landmarks and worked out which was the 
right one. 

He climbed it. It wasn't. 

"Damn," he said. "Excuse me!" he called out to the old man again, 
who was now straight in front of him and forty feet away. "Got lost. 

Be with you in a minute." Down he went again, getting very hot and 
bothered. 



When he arrived, panting and sweating, at the top of the pole that 
he knew for certain was the right one he realised that the man was, 
somehow or other, mucking him about. 

"What do you want?" shouted the old man crossly at him. He was 
now sitting on top of the pole that Arthur recognised was the one 
that he had been on himself when eating his sandwich. 

"How did you get over there?" called Arthur in bewilderment. 

"You think I'm going to tell you just like that what it took me forty 
springs, summers and autumns of sitting on top of a pole to work 
out?" 

"What about winter?" 

"What about winter?" 

"Don't you sit on the pole in the winter?" 

"Just because I sit up a pole for most of my life," said the man, 
"doesn't mean I'm an idiot. I go south in the winter. Got a beach 
house. Sit on the chimney stack." 

"Do you have any advice for a traveller?" 

"Yes. Get a beach house." 

"I see." 

The man stared out over the hot, dry scrubby landscape. From here 
Arthur could just see the old woman, a tiny speck in the distance, 
dancing up and down swatting flies. 

"You see her?" called the old man, suddenly. 

"Yes," said Arthur. "I consulted her in fact." 

"Fat lot she knows. I got the beach house because she turned it 
down. What advice did she give you?" 

"Do exactly the opposite of everything she's done." 

"In other words, get a beach house." 

"I suppose so," said Arthur. "Well, maybe I'll get one." 

"Hmmm." 

The horizon was swimming in a fetid heat haze. 

"Any other advice?" asked Arthur. "Other than to do with real 
estate?" 

"A beach house isn't just real estate. It's a state of mind," said the 
man. He turned and looked at Arthur. 



Oddly, the man's face was now only a couple of feet away. He 
seemed in one way to be a perfectly normal shape, but his body was 
sitting cross-legged on a pole forty feet away while his face was only 
two feet from Arthur's. Without moving his head, and without 
seeming to do anything odd at all, he stood up and stepped on to the 
top of another pole. Either it was just the heat, thought Arthur, or 
space was a different shape for him. 

"A beach house," he said, "doesn't even have to be on the beach. 
Though the best ones are. We all like to congregate," he went on, "at 
boundary conditions." 

"Really?" said Arthur. 

"Where land meets water. Where earth meets air. Where body 
meets mind. Where space meets time. We like to be on one side, and 
look at the other." 

Arthur got terribly excited. This was exactly the sort of thing he'd 
been promised in the brochure. Here was a man who seemed to be 
moving through some kind of Escher space saying really profound 
things about all sorts of stuff. 

It was unnerving though. The man was now stepping from pole to 
ground, from ground to pole, from pole to pole, from pole to horizon 
and back: he was making complete nonsense of Arthur's spatial 
universe. "Please stop!" Arthur said, suddenly. 

"Can't take it, huh?" said the man. Without the slightest movement 
he was now back, sitting cross-legged, on top of the pole forty feet in 
front of Arthur. "You come to me for advice, but you can't cope with 
anything you don't recognise. Hmmm. So we'll have to tell you 
something you already know but make it sound like news, eh? Well, 
business as usual I suppose." He sighed and squinted mournfully into 
the distance. 

"Where you from, boy?" he then asked. Arthur decided to be clever. 
He was fed up with being mistaken for a complete idiot by everyone 
he ever met. "Tell you what," he said. "You're a seer. Why don't you 
tell me?" 

The old man sighed again. "I was just," he said, passing his hand 
round behind his head, "making conversation." When he brought his 
hand round to the front again, he had a globe of the Earth spinning on 
his up-pointed forefinger. It was unmistakable. He put it away again. 
Arthur was stunned. 



"How did you - " 

"I can't tell you." 

"Why not? I've come all this way." "You cannot see what I see 
because you see what you see. You cannot know what I know 
because you know what you know. What I see and what I know 
cannot be added to what you see and what you know because they 
are not of the same kind. Neither can it replace what you see and 
what you know, because that would be to replace you yourself." 

"Hang on, can I write this down?" said Arthur, excitedly fumbling in 
his pocket for a pencil. 

"You can pick up a copy at the spaceport," said the old man. 
"They've got racks of the stuff." 

"Oh," said Arthur, disappointed. "Well, isn't there anything that's 
perhaps a bit more specific to me?" 

"Everything you see or hear or experience in any way at all is 
specific to you. You create a universe by perceiving it, so everything in 
the universe you perceive is specific to you." 

Arthur looked at him doubtfully. "Can I get that at the spaceport, 
too?" he said. 

"Check it out," said the old man. 

"It says in the brochure," said Arthur, pulling it out of his pocket 
and looking at it again, "that I can have a special prayer, individually 
tailored to me and my special needs." 

"Oh, all right," said the old man. "Here's a prayer for you. Got a 
pencil?" 

"Yes," said Arthur. 

"It goes like this. Let's see now: "'Protect me from knowing what I 
don't need to know. Protect me from even knowing that there are 
things to know that I don't know. Protect me from knowing that I 
decided not to know about the things that I decided not to know 
about. Amen.'" That's it. It's what you pray silently inside yourself 
anyway, so you may as well have it out in the open." 

"Hmmm," said Arthur. "Well, thank you - " 

"There's another prayer that goes with it that's very important," 
continued the old man, "so you'd better jot this down, too." 

"OK." 



"It goes, '"Lord, lord, lord..."' It's best to put that bit in, just in case. 
You can never be too sure "'Lord, lord, lord. Protect me from the 
consequences of the above prayer. Amen...'" And that's it. Most of 
the trouble people get into in life comes from missing out that last 
part." 

"Ever heard of a place called Stavromula Beta?" asked Arthur. 

"No." 

"Well, thank you for your help," said Arthur. 

"Don't mention it," said the man on the pole, and vanished. 



Chapter 10 


Ford hurled himself at the door of the editor-in-chiefs office, 
tucked himself into a tight ball as the frame splintered and gave way 
once again, rolled rapidly across the floor to where the smart grey 
crushed leather sofa was and set up his strategic operational base 
behind it. 

That, at least, was the plan. 

Unfortunately the smart grey crushed leather sofa wasn't there. 

Why, thought Ford, as he twisted himself round in mid-air, lurched, 
dived and scuttled for cover behind Harl's desk, did people have this 
stupid obsession with rearranging their office furniture every five 
minutes? 

Why, for instance, replace a perfectly serviceable if rather muted 
grey crushed leather sofa with what appeared to be a small tank? 

And who was the big guy with the mobile rocket launcher on his 
shoulder? Someone from head office? Couldn't be. This was head 
office. At least it was the head office of the Guide. Where these 
InfiniDim Enterprises guys came from Zarquon knew. Nowhere very 
sunny, judging from the slug-like colour and texture of their skins. This 
was all wrong, thought Ford. People connected with the Guide should 
come from sunny places. 

There were several of them, in fact, and all of them seemed to be 
more heavily armed and armoured than you normally expected 
corporate executives to be, even in today's rough and tumble 
business world. 

Fie was making a lot of assumptions here, of course. Fie was 
assuming that the big, bull-necked, slug-like guys were in some way 
connected with InfiniDim Enterprises, but it was a reasonable 
assumption and he felt happy about it because they had logos on 
their armour-plating which said "InfiniDim Enterprises" on them. Fie 
had a nagging suspicion that this was not a business meeting, though. 



He also had a nagging feeling that these slug-like creatures were 
familiar to him in some way. Familiar, but in an unfamiliar guise. 

Well, he had been in the room for a good two and a half seconds 
now, and thought that it was probably about time to start doing 
something constructive. He could take a hostage. That would be good. 

Vann Harl was in his swivel chair, looking alarmed, pale and shaken. 
Had probably had some bad news as well as a nasty bang to the back 
of his head. Ford leapt to his feet and made a running grab for him. 

Under the pretext of getting him into a good solid double 
underpinned elbow-lock. Ford managed surreptitiously to slip the 
Ident-i-Eeze back into Harl's inner pocket. 

Bingo! 

He'd done what he came to do. Now he just had to talk his way out 
of here. 

"OK," he said. "I..." He paused. 

The big guy with the rocket launcher was turning towards Ford 
Prefect and pointing it at him, which Ford couldn't help feeling was 
wildly irresponsible behaviour. 

"I..." he started again, and then on a sudden impulse decided to 
duck. 

There was a deafening roar as flames leapt from the back of the 
rocket launcher and a rocket leapt from its front. 

The rocket hurtled past Ford and hit the large plate-glass window, 
which billowed outwards in a shower of a million shards under the 
force of the explosion. Huge shock waves of noise and air pressure 
reverberated around the room, sweeping a couple of chairs, a filing 
cabinet and Colin the security robot out of the window. 

Ah! So they're not totally rocket-proof after all, thought Ford 
Prefect to himself. Someone should have a word with somebody 
about that. He disentangled himself from Harl and tried to work out 
which way to run. 

He was surrounded. 

The big guy with the rocket launcher was moving it up into position 
for another shot. Ford was completely at a loss for what to do next. 

"Look," he said in a stern voice. But he wasn't certain how far 
saying things like "Look" in a stern voice was necessarily going to get 
him, and time was not on his side. What the hell, he thought, you're 



only young once, and threw himself out of the window. That would at 
least keep the element of surprise on his side. 



Chapter 11 


The first thing Arthur Dent had to do, he realised resignedly, was to 
get himself a life. This meant he had to find a planet he could have 
one on. It had to be a planet he could breathe on, where he could 
stand up and sit down without experiencing gravitational discomfort. 

It had to be somewhere where the acid levels were low and the plants 
didn't actually attack you. 

"I hate to be anthropic about this," he said to the strange thing 
behind the desk at the Resettlement Advice Centre on Pintleton Alpha, 
"but I'd quite like to live somewhere where the people look vaguely 
like me as well. You know. Sort of human." 

The strange thing behind the desk waved some of its stranger bits 
around and seemed rather taken aback by this. It oozed and glopped 
off its seat, thrashed its way slowly across the floor, ingested the old 
metal filing cabinet and then, with a great belch, excreted the 
appropriate drawer. It popped out a couple of glistening tentacles 
from its ear, removed some files from the drawer, sucked the drawer 
back in and vomited up the cabinet again. It thrashed its way back 
across the floor, slimed its way back up on to the seat and slapped the 
files on the table. 

"See anything you fancy?" it asked. 

Arthur looked nervously through some grubby and damp pieces of 
paper. He was definitely in some backwater part of the Galaxy here, 
and somewhere off to the left as far as the universe he knew and 
recognised was concerned. In the space where his own home should 
have been there was a rotten hick planet, drowned with rain and 
inhabited by thugs and boghogs. Even The Hitchhiker's Guide to the 
Galaxy seemed to work only fitfully here, which was why he was 
reduced to making these sorts of enquiries in these sorts of places. 

One place he always asked after was Stavromula Beta, but no one had 
ever heard of such a planet. 



The available worlds looked pretty grim. They had little to offer him 
because he had little to offer them. He had been extremely chastened 
to realise that although he originally came from a world which had 
cars and computers and ballet and armagnac he didn't, by himself, 
know how any of it worked. He couldn't do it. Left to his own devices 
he couldn't build a toaster. He could just about make a sandwich and 
that was it. There was not a lot of demand for his services. 

Arthur's heart sank. This surprised him, because he thought it was 
already about as low as it could possibly be. He closed his eyes for a 
moment. He so much wanted to be home. He so much wanted his 
own home world, the actual Earth he had grown up on, not to have 
been demolished. He so much wanted none of this to have happened. 
He so much wanted that when he opened his eyes again he would be 
standing on the doorstep of his little cottage in the west country of 
England, that the sun would be shining over the green hills, the post 
van would be going up the lane, the daffodils would be blooming in 
his garden, and in the distance the pub would be opening for lunch. 

He so much wanted to take the newspaper down to the pub and read 
it over a pint of bitter. He so much wanted to do the crossword. He so 
much wanted to be able to get completely stuck on 17 across. 

He opened his eyes. 

The strange thing was pulsating irritably at him, tapping some kind 
of pseudopodia on the desk. 

Arthur shook his head and looked at the next sheet of paper. 

Grim, he thought. And the next. 

Very grim. And the next. 

Oh... Now that looked better. 

It was a world called Bartledan. It had oxygen. It had green hills. It 
even, it seemed, had a renowned literary culture. But the thing that 
most aroused his interest was a photograph of a small bunch of 
Bartledanian people, standing around in a village square, smiling 
pleasantly at the camera. 

"Ah," he said, and held the picture up to the strange thing behind 
the desk. 

Its eyes squirmed out on stalks and roiled up and down the piece of 
paper, leaving a glistening trail of slime all over it. 

"Yes," it said with distaste. "They do look exactly like you." 



Arthur moved to Bartledan and, using some money he had made 
by selling some toenail clippings and spit to a DNA bank, he bought 
himself a room in the village featured in the picture. It was pleasant 
there. The air was balmy. The people looked like him and seemed not 
to mind him being there. They didn't attack him with anything. He 
bought some clothes and a cupboard to put them in. 

He had got himself a life. Now he had to find a purpose in it. 

At first he tried to sit and read. But the literature of Bartledan, 
famed though it was throughout this sector of the Galaxy for its 
subtlety and grace, didn't seem to be able to sustain his interest. The 
problem was that it wasn't actually about human beings after all. It 
wasn't about what human beings wanted. The people of Bartledan 
were remarkably like human beings to look at, but when you said 
"Good evening" to one, he would tend to look around with a slight 
sense of surprise, sniff the air and say that, yes, he supposed that it 
probably was a goodish evening now that Arthur came to mention it. 

"No, what I meant was to wish you a good evening," Arthur would 
say, or rather, used to say. He soon learned to avoid these 
conversations. "I mean that I hope you have a good evening," he 
would add. 

More puzzlement. 

"Wish?" the Bartledanian would say at last, in polite bafflement. 

"Er, yes," Arthur would then have said. "I'm just expressing the 
hope that..." 

"Hope?" 

"Yes." 

"What is hope?" 

Good question, thought Arthur to himself, and retreated back to 
his room to think about things. 

On the one hand he could only recognise and respect what he 
learnt about the Bartledanian view of the universe, which was that 
the universe was what the universe was, take it or leave it. On the 
other hand he could not help but feel that not to desire anything, not 
ever to. wish or to hope, was just not natural. 

Natural. There was a tricky word. 



He had long ago realised that a lot of things that he had thought of 
as natural, like buying people presents at Christmas, stopping at red 
lights or falling at a rate of 32 feet/second/second, were just the 
habits of his own world and didn't necessarily work the same way 
anywhere else; but not to wish - that really couldn't be natural, could 
it? That would be like not breathing. 

Breathing was another thing that the Bartledanians didn't do, 
despite all the oxygen in the atmosphere. They just stood there. 
Occasionally they ran around and played netball and stuff (without 
ever wishing to win though, of course - they would just play, and 
whoever won, won), but they never actually breathed. It was, for 
some reason, unnecessary. Arthur quickly learned that playing netball 
with them was just too spooky. Though they looked like humans, and 
even moved and sounded like humans, they didn't breathe and they 
didn't wish for things. 

Breathing and wishing for things, on the other hand, was just about 
all that Arthur seemed to do all day. Sometimes he would wish for 
things so much that his breathing would get quite agitated, and he 
would have to go and lie down for a bit. On his own. In his small room. 
So far from the world which had given birth to him that his brain 
could not even process the sort of numbers involved without just 
going limp. 

He preferred not to think about it. He preferred just to sit and read 
- or at least he would prefer it if there was anything worth reading. 

But nobody in Bartledanian stories ever wanted anything. Not even a 
glass of water. Certainly, they would fetch one if they were thirsty, 
but if there wasn't one available, they would think no more about it. 

He had just read an entire book in which the main character had, over 
the course of a week, done some work in his garden, played a great 
deal of netball, helped mend a road, fathered a child on his wife and 
then unexpectedly died of thirst just before the last chapter. In 
exasperation Arthur had combed his way back through the book and 
in the end had found a passing reference to some problem with the 
plumbing in Chapter 2. And that was it. So the guy dies. It just 
happens. 

It wasn't even the climax of the book, because there wasn't one. 

The character died about a third of the way through the penultimate 
chapter of the book, and the rest of it was just more stuff about road- 



mending. The book just finished dead at the one hundred thousandth 
word, because that was how long books were on Bartledan. 

Arthur threw the book across the room, sold the room and left. He 
started to travel with wild abandon, trading in more and more spit, 
toenails, fingernails, blood, hair, anything that anybody wanted, for 
tickets. For semen, he discovered, he could travel first class. He 
settled nowhere, but only existed in the hermetic, twilight world of 
the cabins of hyperspatial starships, eating, drinking, sleeping, 
watching movies, only stopping at spaceports to donate more DNA 
and catch the next long-haul ship out. He waited and waited for 
another accident to happen. 

The trouble with trying to make the right accident happen is that it 
won't. That is not what "accident" means. The accident that 
eventually occurred was not what he had planned at all. The ship he 
was on blipped in hyperspace, flickered horribly between ninety- 
seven different points in the Galaxy simultaneously, caught the 
unexpected gravitational pull of an uncharted planet in one of them, 
became ensnared in its outer atmosphere and began to fall, 
screaming and tearing, into it. 

The ship's systems protested all the way down that everything was 
perfectly normal and under control, but when it went into a final 
hectic spin, ripped wildly through half a mile of trees and finally 
exploded into a seething ball of flame it became clear that this was 
not the case. 

Fire engulfed the forest, boiled into the night, then neatly put itself 
out, as all unscheduled fires over a certain size are now required to do 
by law. For a short while afterwards, other small fires flared up here 
and there as odd pieces of scattered debris exploded quietly in their 
own time. Then they too died away. 

Arthur Dent, because of the sheer boredom of endless inter-stellar 
flight, was the only one on board who had actually familiarised 
himself with the ship's safety procedures in case of an unscheduled 
landing, and was therefore the sole survivor. He lay dazed, broken 
and bleeding in a sort of fluffy pink plastic cocoon with "Have a nice 
day" printed in over three thousand different languages all over it. 

Black, roaring silences swam sickeningly through his shattered 
mind. He knew with a kind of resigned certainty that he would survive, 
because he had not yet been to Stavromula Beta. 



After what seemed an eternity of pain and darkness, he became 
aware of quiet shapes moving around him. 



Chapter 12 


Ford tumbled through the open air in a cloud of glass splinters and 
chair parts. Again, he hadn't really thought things through, really, and 
was just playing it by ear, buying time. At times of major crisis he 
found it was often quite helpful to have his life flash before his eyes. It 
gave him a chance to reflect on things, see things in some sort of 
perspective, and it sometimes furnished him with a vital clue as to 
what to do next. 

There was the ground rushing up to meet him at 30 feet per 
second per second, but he would, he thought, deal with that problem 
when he got to it. First things first. 

Ah, here it came. His childhood. Flum drum stuff, he'd been 
through it all before. Images flashed by. Boring times on Betelgeuse 
Five. Zaphod Beeblebrox as a kid. Yes he knew all that. Fie wished he 
had some kind of fast forward in his brain. His seventh birthday party, 
being given his first towel. Come on, come on. 

Fie was twisting and turning downwards, the outside air at this 
height a cold shock to his lungs. Trying not to inhale glass. 

Early voyages to other planets. Oh for Zark's sake, this was like 
some sort of bloody travelogue documentary before the main feature. 
First beginning to work for the Guide. 

Ah! 

Those were the days. They worked out of a hut on the Bwenelli 
Atoll on Fanalla before the Riktanarqals and the Danqueds vertled it. 

Ha If a dozen guys, some towels, a handful of highly sophisticated 
digital devices, and most importantly a lot of dreams. No. Most 
importantly a lot of Fanallan rum. To be completely accurate, that 01" 
Janx Spirit was the absolute most important thing, then the Fanallan 
rum, and also some of the beaches on the Atoll where the local girls 
would hang out, but the dreams were important as well. Whatever 
happened to those? 



He couldn't quite remember what the dreams were in fact, but 
they had seemed immensely important at the time. They had 
certainly not involved this huge towering office block he was now 
falling down the side of. All of that had come when some of the 
original team had started to settle down and get greedy, while he and 
others had stayed out in the field, researching and hitch hiking, and 
gradually becoming more and more isolated from the corporate 
nightmare the Guide had inexorably turned into, and the architectural 
monstrosity it had come to occupy. Where were the dreams in that? 
He thought of all the corporate lawyers who occupied half of the 
building, all the "operatives" who occupied the lower levels, and all 
the sub-editors and their secretaries and their secretaries lawyers and 
their secretaries lawyers secretaries, and worst of all the accountants 
and the marketing department. 

He had half a mind just to keep on falling. Two fingers to the lot of 
them. 

He was just passing the seventeenth floor now, where the 
marketing department hung out. Load of tosspots all arguing about 
what colour the Guide should be and exercising their infinitely 
infallible skills of being wise after the event. If any of them had 
chosen to look out of the window at that moment they would have 
been startled by the sight of Ford Prefect dropping past them to his 
certain death and flicking V-signs at them. 

Sixteenth floor. Sub-editors. Bastards. What about all that copy of 
his they'd cut? Fifteen years of research he'd filed from one planet 
alone and they'd cut it to two words. "Mostly Harmless." V-signs to 
them as well. 

Fifteenth floor. Logistical Administration, whatever that was about. 
They all had big cars. That, he thought, was what that was about. 

Fourteenth floor. Personnel. He had a very shrewd suspicion that it 
was they who had engineered his fifteen-year exile while the Guide 
metamorphosed into the corporate monolith (or rather, duolith - 
mustn't forget the lawyers) it had become. 

Thirteenth floor. Research and development. 

Hang about. 

Thirteenth floor. 



He was having to think rather fast at the moment because the 
situation was becoming a little urgent. 

He suddenly remembered the floor display panel in the elevator. It 
hadn't had a thirteenth floor. He'd thought no more about it because, 
having spent fifteen years on the rather backward planet Earth where 
they were superstitious about the number thirteen, he was used to 
being in buildings that numbered their floors without it. No reason for 
that here, though. 

The windows of the thirteenth floor, he could not help noticing as 
he flashed swiftly by them, were darkened. 

What was going on in there? He started to remember all the stuff 
that Harl had been talking about. One, new, multi-dimensional Guide 
spread across an infinite number of universes. It had sounded, the 
way Harl had put it, like wild meaninglessness dreamed up by the 
marketing department with the backing of the accountants. If it was 
any more real than that then it was a very weird and dangerous idea. 
Was it real? What was going on behind the darkened windows of the 
sealed-off thirteenth floor? 

Ford felt a rising sense of curiosity, and then a rising sense of panic. 
That was the complete list of rising feelings he had. In every other 
respect he was falling very rapidly. He really ought to turn his mind to 
wondering how he was going to get out of this situation alive. 

He glanced down. A hundred feet or so below him people were 
milling around, some of them beginning to look up expectantly. 
Clearing a space for him. Even temporarily calling off the wonderful 
and completely fatuous hunt for wockets. 

He would hate to disappoint them, but about two feet below him, 
he hadn't realised before, was Colin. Colin had obviously been happily 
dancing attendance and waiting for him to decide what he wanted to 
do. 

"Colin!" Ford bawled. 

Colin didn't respond. Ford went cold. Then he suddenly realised 
that he hadn't told Colin his name was Colin. 

"Come up here!" Ford bawled. 

Colin bobbed up beside him. Colin was enjoying the ride down 
immensely and hoped that Ford was, too. 



Colin's world went unexpectedly dark as Ford's towel suddenly 
enveloped him. Colin immediately felt himself get much, much 
heavier. He was thrilled and delighted by the challenge that Ford had 
presented him with. Just not sure if he could handle it, that was all. 

The towel was slung over Colin. Ford was hanging from the towel, 
gripping to its seams. Other hitchhikers had seen fit to modify their 
towels in exotic ways, weaving all kinds of esoteric tools and utilities 
and even computer equipment into their fabric. Ford was a purist. He 
liked to keep things simple. He carried a regular towel from a regular 
domestic soft furnishings shop. It even had a kind of blue and pink 
floral pattern despite his repeated attempts to bleach and stone wash 
it. It had a couple of pieces of wire threaded into it, a bit of flexible 
writing stick, and also some nutrients soaked into one of the corners 
of the fabric so he could suck it in an emergency, but otherwise it was 
a simple towel you could dry your face on. 

The only actual modification he had been persuaded by a friend to 
make to it was to reinforce the seams. 

Ford gripped the seams like a maniac. 

They were still descending, but the rate had slowed. 

"Up, Colin!" he shouted. 

Nothing. 

"Your name," shouted Ford, "is Colin. So when I shout "'Up, Colin!"' 
I want you, Colin, to go up. OK? Up, Colin!" 

Nothing. Or rather a sort of muffled groaning sound from Colin. 
Ford was very anxious. They were descending very slowly now, but 
Ford was very anxious about the sort of people he could see 
assembling on the ground beneath him. Friendly, local, wocket- 
hunting types were dispersing, and thick, heavy, bull-necked, slug-like 
creatures with rocket launchers were, it seemed, sliding out of what 
was usually called thin air. Thin air, as all experienced Galactic 
travellers well know, is, in fact, extremely thick with multi¬ 
dimensional complexities. 

"Up," bellowed Ford again. "Up! Colin, go up!" 

Colin was straining and groaning. They were now more or less 
stationary in the air. Ford felt as if his fingers were breaking. 

"Up!" 

They stayed put. 



"Up, up, up!" 

A slug was preparing to launch a rocket at him. Ford couldn't 
believe it. He was hanging from a towel in mid-air and a slug was 
preparing to fire rockets at him. He was running out of anything he 
could think of doing and was beginning to get seriously alarmed. 

This was the sort of predicament that he usually relied on having 
the Guide available for to give advice, however infuriating or glib, but 
this was not a moment for reaching into his pocket. And the Guide 
seemed to be no longer a friend and ally but was now itself a source 
of danger. These were the Guide offices he was hanging outside, for 
Zark's sake, in danger of his life from the people who now appeared 
to own the thing. What had become of all the dreams he vaguely 
remembered having on the Bwenelli Atoll? They should have let it all 
be. They should have stayed there. Stayed on the beach. Loved good 
women. Lived on fish. He should have known it was all wrong the 
moment they started hanging grand pianos over the sea-monster 
pool in the atrium. He began to feel thoroughly wasted and miserable. 
His fingers were on fire with clenched pain. And his ankle was still 
hurting. 

Oh thank you, ankle, he thought to himself bitterly. Thank you for 
bringing up your problems at this time. I expect you'd like a nice warm 
footbath to make you feel better, wouldn't you? Or at least you'd like 
me to... 

He had an idea. 

The armoured slug had hoisted the rocket launcher up on to its 
shoulder. The rocket was presumably designed to hit anything in its 
path that moved. 

Ford tried not to sweat because he could feel his grip on the seams 
of his towel slipping. 

With the toe of his good foot he nudged and prised at the heel of 
the shoe on his hurting foot. 

"Go up, damn you!" Ford muttered hopelessly to Colin, who was 
cheerily straining away but unable to rise. Ford worked away at the 
heel of his shoe. 

He was trying to judge the timing, but there was no point. Just go 
for it. He only had one shot and that was it. He had now eased the 



back of his shoe down off his heel. His twisted ankle felt a little better. 
Well that was good, wasn't it? 

With his other foot he kicked at the heel of the shoe. It slipped off 
his foot and fell through the air. About half a second later a rocket 
erupted up from the muzzle of its launcher, encountered the shoe 
falling through its path, went straight for it, hit it, and exploded with a 
great sense of satisfaction and achievement. 

This happened about fifteen feet from the ground. 

The main force of the explosion was directed downwards. Where, a 
second earlier, there had been a squad of InfiniDim Enterprises 
executives with a rocket launcher standing on an elegant terraced 
plaza paved with large slabs of lustrous stone cut from the ancient 
alabastrum quarries of Zentalquabula there was now, instead, a bit of 
a pit with nasty bits in it. 

A great wump of hot air welled up from the explosion throwing 
Ford and Colin violently up into the sky. Ford fought desperately and 
blindly to hold on and failed. He turned helplessly upwards through 
the sky, reached the peak of a parabola, paused and then started to 
fall again. He fell and fell and fell and suddenly winded himself badly 
on Colin, who was still rising. 

He clasped himself desperately on to the small spherical robot. 
Colin slewed wildly through the air towards the tower of the Guide 
offices, trying delightedly to control himself and slow down. 

The world span sickeningly round Ford's head as they span and 
twisted round each other and then, equally sickeningly, everything 
suddenly stopped. 

Ford found himself deposited dizzily on a window ledge. 

His towel fell past and he grabbed at it and caught it. 

Colin bobbed in the air inches away from him. 

Ford looked around himself in a bruised, bleeding and breath-less 
daze. The ledge was only about a foot wide and he was perched 
precariously on it, thirteen stories up. 

Thirteen. 

He knew they were thirteen stories up because the windows were 
dark. He was bitterly upset. He had bought those shoes for some 
absurd price in a store on the Lower East Side in New York. He had, as 
a result, written an entire essay on the joys of great footwear, all of 



which had been jettisoned in the "Mostly harmless" debacle. Damn 
everything. 

And now one of the shoes was gone. He threw his head back and 
stared at the sky. 

It wouldn't be such a grim tragedy if the planet in question hadn't 
been demolished, which meant that he wouldn't even be able to get 
another pair. 

Yes, given the infinite sideways extension of probability there was, 
of course, an almost infinite multiplicity of planets Earth, but, when 
you came down to it, a major pair of shoes wasn't something you 
could just replace by mucking about in multi-dimensional space/time. 

He sighed. 

Oh well, he'd better make the best of it. At least it had saved his 
life. For the time being. 

He was perched on a foot-wide ledge thirteen stories up the side of 
a building and he wasn't at all sure that that was worth a good shoe. 

He stared in woozily through the darkened glass. 

It was as dark and silent as the tomb. 

No. That was a ridiculous thing to think. He'd been to some great 
parties in tombs. 

Could he detect some movement? He wasn't quite sure. It seemed 
that he could see some kind of weird, flapping shadow. Perhaps it was 
just blood dribbling over his eyelashes. He wiped it away. Boy, he'd 
love to have a farm somewhere, keep some sheep. He peered into 
the window again, trying to make out what the shape was, but he had 
the feeling, so common in today's universe, that he was looking into 
some kind of optical illusion and that his eyes were just playing silly 
buggers with him. 

Was there a bird of some kind in there? Was that what they had 
hidden away up here on a concealed floor behind darkened, rocket- 
proof glass? Someone's aviary? There was certainly something 
flapping about in there, but it seemed like not so much a bird, more a 
kind of bird-shaped hole in space. 

He closed his eyes, which he'd been wanting to do for a bit anyway. 
He wondered what the hell to do next. Jump? Climb? He didn't think 
there was going to be any way of breaking in. OK, the supposedly 
rocket-proof glass hadn't stood up, when it came to it, to an actual 



rocket, but then that had been a rocket that had been fired at very 
short range from inside, which probably wasn't what the engineers 
who designed it had had in mind. It didn't mean he was going to be 
able to break the window here by wrapping his fist in his towel and 
punching. What the hell, he tried it anyway and hurt his fist. It was 
just as well he couldn't get a good swing from where he was sitting or 
he might have hurt it quite badly. The building had been sturdily 
reinforced when it was completely rebuilt after the Frogstar attack, 
and was probably the most heavily armoured publishing company in 
the business, but there was always, he thought, some weakness in 
any system designed by a corporate committee. He had already found 
one of them. The engineers who designed the windows had not 
expected them to be hit by a rocket from short range from the inside, 
so the window had failed. 

So, what would the engineers not be expecting someone sitting on 
the ledge outside the window to do? 

He wracked his brains for a moment or so before he got it. 

The thing they wouldn't be expecting him to do was to be there in 
the first place. Only an absolute idiot would be sitting where he was, 
so he was winning already. A common mistake that people make 
when trying to design something completely foolproof is to 
underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools. 

He pulled his newly acquired credit card from his pocket, slid it into 
a crack where the window met its surrounding frame, and did 
something a rocket would not have been able to do. He wiggled it 
around a bit. He felt a catch slip. He slid the window open and almost 
fell backwards off the ledge laughing, giving thanks as he did so for 
the Great Ventilation and Telephone Riots of SrDt 3454. 

The Great Ventilation and Telephone Riots of SrDt 3454 had started 
off as just a lot of hot air. Hot air was, of course, the problem that 
ventilation was supposed to solve and generally it had solved the 
problem reasonably well up to the point when someone invented air- 
conditioning, which solved the problem far more throbbingly. 

And that was all well and good provided you could stand the noise 
and the dribbling until someone else came up with something even 
sexier and smarter than air-conditioning which was called in-building 
climate control. 



Now this was quite something. 

The major differences from just ordinary air-conditioning were that 
it was thrillingly more expensive, involved a huge amount of 
sophisticated measuring and regulating equipment which was far 
better at knowing, moment by moment, what kind of air people 
wanted to breathe than mere people did. 

It also meant that, to be sure that mere people didn't muck up the 
sophisticated calculations which the system was making on their 
behalf, all the windows in the buildings were built sealed shut. This is 
true. 

While the systems were being installed, a number of people who 
were going to work in the buildings found themselves having 
conversations with Breathe-o-Smart systems fitters which went 
something like this: 

"But what if we want to have the windows open?" 

"You won't want to have the windows open with new Breathe-o- 
Smart." 

"Yes but supposing we just wanted to have them open for a little 
bit?" 

"You won't want to have them open even for a little bit. The new 
Breathe-o-Smart system will see to that." 

"Hmmm." 

"Enjoy Breathe-o-Smart!" 

"OK, so what if the Breathe-o-Smart breaks down or goes wrong or 
something?" 

"Ah! One of the smartest features of the Breathe-o-Smart is that it 
cannot possibly go wrong. So. No worries on that score. Enjoy your 
breathing now, and have a nice day." 

(It was, of course, as a result of the Great Ventilation and 
Telephone Riots of SrDt 3454, that all mechanical or electrical or 
quantum-mechanical or hydraulic or even wind, steam or piston- 
driven devices, are now requited to have a certain legend 
emblazoned on them somewhere. It doesn't matter how small the 
object is, the designers of the object have got to find a way of 
squeezing the legend in somewhere, because it is their attention 
which is being drawn to it rather than necessarily that of the user's. 

The legend is this: 



"The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a 
thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot 
possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to 
get at or repair.') 

Major heat waves started to coincide, with almost magical 
precision, with major failures of the Breathe-o-Smart systems. To 
begin with this merely caused simmering resentment and only a few 
deaths from asphyxiation. 

The real horror erupted on the day that three events happened 
simultaneously. The first event was that Breathe-o-Smart Inc. issued a 
statement to the effect that best results were achieved by using their 
systems in temperate climates. 

The second event was the breakdown of a Breathe-o-Smart system 
on a particularly hot and humid day with the resulting evacuation of 
many hundreds of office staff into the street where they met the third 
event, which was a rampaging mob of long-distance telephone 
operators who had got so twisted with having to say, all day and 
every day, "Thank you for using BS&S" to every single idiot who 
picked up a phone that they had finally taken to the streets with trash 
cans, megaphones and rifles. 

In the ensuing days of carnage every single window in the city, 
rocket-proof or not, was smashed, usually to accompanying cries of 
"Get off the line, asshole! I don't care what number you want, what 
extension you're calling from. Go and stick a firework up your bottom! 
Yeeehaah! Hoo Hoo Hoo! Velooooom! Squawk!" and a variety of 
other animal noises that they didn't get a chance to practise in the 
normal line of their work. 

As a result of this, all telephone operators were granted a 
constitutional right to say "Use BS&S and die!" at least once an hour 
when answering the phone and all office buildings were required to 
have windows that opened, even if only a little bit. 

Another, unexpected result was a dramatic lowering of the suicide 
rate. All sorts of stressed and rising executives who had been forced, 
during the dark days of the Breathe-o-Smart tyranny, to jump in front 
of trains or stab themselves, could now just clamber out on to their 
own window ledges and leap off at their leisure. What frequently 
happened, though, was that in the moment or two they had to look 
around and gather their thoughts they would suddenly discover that 



all they had really needed was a breath of air and a fresh perspective 
on things, and maybe also a farm on which they could keep a few 
sheep. 

Another completely unlooked for result was that Ford Prefect, 
stranded thirteen stories up a heavily armoured building armed with 
nothing but a towel and a credit card was nevertheless able to 
clamber through a supposedly rocket-proof window to safety. 

He closed the window neatly after him, having first allowed Colin 
to follow him through, and then started to look around for this bird 
thing. 

The thing he realised about the windows was this: because they 
had been converted into openable windows after they had first been 
designed to be impregnable, they were, in fact, much less secure than 
if they had been designed as openable windows in the first place. 

Hey ho, it's a funny old life, he was just thinking to himself, when 
he suddenly realised that the room he had gone to all this trouble to 
break into was not a very interesting one. 

He stopped in surprise. 

Where was the strange flapping shape? Where was anything that 
was worth all this palaver-the extraordinary veil of secrecy that 
seemed to lie over this room and the equally extraordinary sequence 
of events that had seemed to conspire to get him into it? 

The room, like every other room in this building now, was done out 
in some appallingly tasteful grey. There were a few charts and 
drawings on the wall. Most of them were meaningless to Ford, but 
then he came across something that was obviously a mock-up for a 
poster of some kind. 

There was a kind of bird-like logo on it, and a slogan which said 
"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Mk II: the single most 
astounding thing of any kind ever. Coming soon to a dimension near 
you." No more information than that. 

Ford looked around again. Then his attention was gradually drawn 
to Colin, the absurdly over-happy security robot, who was cowering in 
a corner of the room gibbering with what seemed strangely like fear. 



Odd, thought Ford. He looked around to see what it was that Colin 
might have been reacting to. Then he saw something that he hadn't 
noticed before, lying quietly on top of a workbench. 

It was circular and black and about the size of a small side plate. Its 
top and its bottom were smoothly convex so that it resembled a small 
lightweight throwing discus. 

Its surfaces seemed to be completely smooth, unbroken and 
featureless. 

It was doing nothing. Then Ford noticed that there was something 
written on it. Strange. There hadn't been anything written on it a 
moment ago and now suddenly there was. There just didn't seem to 
have been any observable transition between the two states. 

All it said, in small, alarming letters was a single word: 

PANIC 

A moment ago there hadn't been any marks or cracks in its surface. 
Now there were. They were growing. 

Panic, the Guide Mk II said. Ford begin to do as he was told. He had 
just remembered why the slug-like creatures looked familiar. Their 
colour scheme was a kind of corporate grey, but in all other respects 
they looked exactly like Vogons. 



Chapter 13 


The ship dropped quietly to land on the edge of the wide clearing, 
a hundred yards or so from the village. 

It arrived suddenly and unexpectedly but with a minimum of fuss. 
One moment it was a perfectly ordinary late afternoon in the early 
autumn - the leaves were just beginning to turn red and gold, the 
river was beginning to swell again with the rains from the mountains 
in the north, the plumage of the pikka birds was beginning to thicken 
in anticipation of the coming winter frosts, any day now the Perfectly 
Normal Beasts would start their thunderous migration across the 
plains, and Old Thrashbarg was beginning to mutter to himself as he 
hobbled his way around the village, a muttering which meant that he 
was rehearsing and elaborating the stories that he would tell of the 
past year once the evenings had drawn in and people had no choice 
but to gather round the fire and listen to him and grumble and say 
that that wasn't how they remembered it - and the next moment 
there was a spaceship sitting there, gleaming in the warm autumn sun. 

It hummed for a bit and then stopped. 

It wasn't a big spaceship. If the villagers had been experts on 
spaceships they would have known at once that it was a pretty nifty 
one, a small sleek Hrundi four-berth runabout with just about every 
optional extra in the brochure except Advanced Vectoid Stabilisis, 
which only wimps went for. You can't get a good tight, sharp curve 
round a tri-lateral time axis with Advanced Vectoid Stabilisis. All right, 
it's a bit safer, but it makes the handling go all soggy. 

The villagers didn't know all that, of course. Most of them here on 
the remote planet of Lamuella had never seen a spaceship, certainly 
not one that was all in one piece, and as it shone warmly in the 
evening light it was just the most extraordinary thing they had come 
across since the day Kirp caught a fish with a head at both ends. 

Everybody had fallen silent. 



Whereas a moment before two or three dozen people had been 
wandering about, chattering, chopping wood, carrying water, teasing 
the pikka birds, or just amiably trying to stay out of Old Thrashbarg's 
way, suddenly all activity died away and everybody turned to look at 
the strange object in amazement. 

Or, not quite everybody. The pikka birds tended to be amazed by 
completely different things. A perfectly ordinary leaf lying 
unexpectedly on a stone would cause them to skitter off in paroxysms 
of confusion; sunrise took them completely by surprise every morning, 
but the arrival of an alien craft from another world simply failed to 
engage any part of their attention. They continued to kar and rit and 
huk as they pecked for seeds on the ground; the river continued with 
its quiet, spacious burbling. 

Also, the noise of loud and tuneless singing from the last hut on the 
left continued unabated. 

Suddenly, with a slight click and a hum, a door folded itself 
outwards and downwards from the spaceship. Then, for a minute or 
two, nothing further seemed to happen, other than the loud singing 
from the last hut on the left, and the thing just sat there. 

Some of the villagers, particularly the boys, began to edge forward 
a little bit to have a closer look. Old Thrashbarg tried to shoo them 
back. This was exactly the sort of thing that Old Thrashbarg didn't like 
to have happening. He hadn't foretold it, not even slightly, and even 
though he would be able to wrestle the whole thing into his 
continuing story somehow or other, it really was all getting a bit much 
to deal with. 

He strode forward, pushed the boys back, and raised his arms and 
his ancient knobbly staff into the air. The long warm light of the 
evening sun caught him nicely. He prepared to welcome whatever 
gods these were as if he had been expecting them all along. 

Still nothing happened. 

Gradually it became clear that there was some kind of argument 
going on inside the craft. Time went by and Old Thrashbarg's arms 
were beginning to ache. 

Suddenly the ramp folded itself back up again. That made it easy 
for Thrashbarg. They were demons and he had repulsed them. The 
reason he hadn't foretold it was that prudence and modesty forbade. 



Almost immediately a different ramp folded itself out on the other 
side of the craft from where Thrashbarg was standing, and two figures 
at last emerged on it, still arguing with each other and ignoring 
everybody, even Thrashbarg, whom they wouldn't even have noticed 
from where they were standing. 

Old Thrashbarg chewed angrily on his beard. 

To continue to stand there with his arms upraised? To kneel with 
his head bowed forward and his staff held out pointing at them? To 
fall backwards as if overcome in some titanic inner struggle? Perhaps 
just to go off to the woods and live in a tree for a year without 
speaking to anyone? 

He opted just to drop his arms smartly as if he had done what he 
meant to do. They were really hurting so he didn't have much choice. 
He made a small, secret sign he had just invented towards the ramp 
which had closed and then made three and a half steps backwards, so 
he could at least get a good look at whoever these people were and 
then decide what to do next. 

The taller one was a very good looking woman wearing soft and 
crumply clothes. Old Thrashbarg didn't know this, but they were 
made of RymplonTM, a new synthetic fabric which was terrific for 
space travel because it looked its absolute best when it was all 
creased and sweaty. 

The shorter one was a girl. She was awkward and sullen looking, 
and was wearing clothes which looked their absolute worst when 
they were all creased and sweaty, and what was more she almost 
certainly knew it. 

All eyes watched them, except for the pikka birds, which had their 
own things to watch. 

The woman stood and looked around her. She had a purposeful air 
about her. There was obviously something in particular she wanted, 
but she didn't know exactly where to find it. She glanced from face to 
face among the villagers assembled curiously around her without 
apparently seeing what she was looking for. 

Thrashbarg had no idea how to play this at all, and decided to 
resort to chanting. He threw back his head and began to wail, but was 
instantly interrupted by a fresh outbreak of song from the hut of the 
Sandwich Maker: the last one on the left. The woman looked round 



sharply, and gradually a smile came over her face. Without so much 
as a glance at Old Thrashbarg she started to walk towards the hut. 

There is an art to the business of making sandwiches which it is 
given to few ever to find the time to explore in depth. It is a simple 
task, but the opportunities for satisfaction are many and profound: 
choosing the right bread for instance. The Sandwich Maker had spent 
many months in daily consultation and experiment with Grarp the 
baker and eventually they had between them created a loaf of exactly 
the consistency that was dense enough to slice thinly and neatly, 
while still being light, moist and having that fine nutty flavour which 
best enhanced the savour of roast Perfectly Normal Beast flesh. 

There was also the geometry of the slice to be refined: the precise 
relationships between the width and height of the slice and also its 
thickness which would give the proper sense of bulk and weight to 
the finished sandwich: here again, lightness was a virtue, but so too 
were firmness, generosity and that promise of succulence and savour 
that is the hallmark of a truly intense sandwich experience. 

The proper tools, of course, were crucial, and many were the days 
that the Sandwich Maker, when not engaged with the Baker at his 
oven, would spend with Strinder the Tool Maker, weighing and 
balancing knives, taking them to the forge and back again. Suppleness, 
strength, keenness of edge, length and balance were all 
enthusiastically debated, theories put forward, tested, refined, and 
many was the evening when the Sandwich Maker and the Tool Maker 
could be seen silhouetted against the light of the setting sun and the 
Tool Maker's forge making slow sweeping movements through the air 
trying one knife after another, comparing the weight of this one with 
the balance of another, the suppleness of a third and the handle 
binding of a fourth. 

Three knives altogether were required. First there was the knife for 
the slicing of the bread: a firm, authoritative blade which imposed a 
clear and defining will on a loaf. Then there was the butter-spreading 
knife, which was a whippy little number but still with a firm backbone 
to it. Early versions had been a little too whippy, but now the 
combination of flexibility with a core of strength was exactly right to 
achieve the maximum smoothness and grace of spread. 



The chief amongst the knives, of course, was the carving knife. This 
was the knife that would not merely impose its will on the medium 
through which it moved, as did the bread knife; it must work with it, 
be Guided by the grain of the meat, to achieve slices of the most 
exquisite consistency and translucency, that would slide away in filmy 
folds from the main hunk of meat. The Sandwich Maker would then 
flip each sheet with a smooth flick of the wrist on to the beautifully 
proportioned lower bread slice, trim it with four deft strokes and then 
at last perform the magic that the children of the village so longed to 
gather round and watch with rapt attention and wonder. With just 
four more dexterous flips of the knife he would assemble the 
trimmings into a perfectly fitting jigsaw of pieces on top of the 
primary slice. For every sandwich the size and shape of the trimmings 
were different, but the Sandwich Maker would always effortlessly and 
without hesitation assemble them into a pattern which fitted 
perfectly. A second layer of meat and a second layer of trimmings, 
and the main act of creation would be accomplished. 

The Sandwich Maker would pass what he had made to his assistant 
who would then add a few slices of newcumber and fladish and a 
touch of splagberry sauce, and then apply the topmost layer of bread 
and cut the sandwich with a fourth and altogether plainer knife. It 
was not that these were not also skillful operations, but they were 
lesser skills to be performed by a dedicated apprentice who would 
one day, when the Sandwich Maker finally laid down his tools, take 
over from him. It was an exalted position and that apprentice, 
Drimple, was the envy of his fellows. There were those in the village 
who were happy chopping wood, those who were content carrying 
water, but to be the Sandwich Maker was very heaven. 

And so the Sandwich Maker sang as he worked. 

He was using the last of the year's salted meat. It was a little past 
its best now, but still the rich savour of Perfectly Normal Beast meat 
was something unsurpassed in any of the Sandwich Maker's previous 
experience. Next week it was anticipated that the Perfectly Normal 
Beasts would appear again for their regular migration, whereupon the 
whole village would once again be plunged into frenetic action: 
hunting the Beasts, killing perhaps six, maybe even seven dozen of 
the thousands that thundered past. Then the Beasts must be rapidly 
butchered and cleaned, with most of the meat salted to keep it 



through the winter months until the return migration in the spring, 
which would replenish their supplies. 

The very best of the meat would be roasted straight away for the 
feast that marked the Autumn Passage. The celebrations would last 
for three days of sheer exuberance, dancing and stories that Old 
Thrashbarg would tell of how the hunt had gone, stories that he 
would have been busy sitting making up in his hut while the rest of 
the village was out doing the actual hunting. 

And then the very, very best of the meat would be saved from the 
feast and delivered cold to the Sandwich Maker. And the Sandwich 
Maker would exercise on it the skills that he had brought to them 
from the gods, and make the exquisite Sandwiches of the Third 
Season, of which the whole village would partake before beginning, 
the next day, to prepare themselves for the rigours of the coming 
winter. 

Today he was just making ordinary sandwiches, if such delicacies, 
so lovingly crafted, could ever be called ordinary. Today his assistant 
was away so the Sandwich Maker was applying his own garnish, 
which he was happy to do. He was happy with just about everything 
in fact. 

He sliced, he sang. He flipped each slice of meat neatly on to a slice 
of bread, trimmed it and assembled all the trimmings into their jigsaw. 
A little salad, a little sauce, another slice of bread, another sandwich, 
another verse of Yellow Submarine. 

"Hello, Arthur." 

The Sandwich Maker almost sliced his thumb off. 

The villagers had watched in consternation as the woman had 
marched boldly to the hut of the Sandwich Maker. The Sandwich 
Maker had been sent to them by Almighty Bob in a burning fiery 
chariot. This, at least, was what Thrashbarg said, and Thrashbarg was 
the authority on these things. So, at least, Thrashbarg claimed, and 
Thrashbarg was... and so on and so on. It was hardly worth arguing 
about. 

A few villagers wondered why Almighty Bob would send his onlie 
begotten Sandwich Maker in a burning fiery chariot rather than 
perhaps in one that might have landed quietly without destroying half 



the forest, filling it with ghosts and also injuring the Sandwich Maker 
quite badly. Old Thrashbarg said that it was the ineffable will of Bob, 
and when they asked him what ineffable meant he said look it up. 

This was a problem because Old Thrashbarg had the only dictionary 
and he wouldn't let them borrow it. They asked him why not and he 
said that it was not for them to know the will of Almighty Bob, and 
when they asked him why not again he said because he said so. 
Anyway, somebody sneaked into Old Thrashbarg's hut one day while 
he was out having a swim and looked up "ineffable". "Ineffable" 
apparently meant "unknowable, indescribable, unutterable, not to be 
known or spoken about". So that cleared that up. 

At least they had got the sandwiches. 

One day Old Thrashbarg said that Almighty Bob had decreed that 
he, Thrashbarg, was to have first pick of the sandwiches. The villagers 
asked him when this had happened, exactly, and Thrashbarg said it 
had happened yesterday, when they weren't looking. "Have faith," 

Old Thrashbarg said, "or burn!" They let him have first pick of the 
sandwiches. It seemed easiest. 

And now this woman had just arrived out of nowhere, and gone 
straight for the Sandwich Maker's hut. His fame had obviously spread, 
though it was hard to know where to since, according to Old 
Thrashbarg, there wasn't anywhere else. Anyway, wherever it was she 
had come from, presumably somewhere ineffable, she was here now 
and was in the Sandwich Maker's hut. Who was she? And who was 
the strange girl who was hanging around outside the hut moodily and 
kicking at stones and showing every sign of not wanting to be there? 

It seemed odd that someone should come all the way from 
somewhere ineffable in a chariot that was obviously a vast 
improvement on the burning fiery one which had brought them the 
Sandwich Maker, if she didn't even want to be here? 

They all looked to Thrashbarg, but he was on his knees mumbling 
and looking very firmly up into the sky and not catching anybody 
else's eye until he'd thought of something. 

"Trillian!" said the Sandwich Maker, sucking his bleeding thumb. 
"What...? Who...? When...? Where...?" 



"Exactly the questions I was going to ask you," said Trillian, looking 
around Arthur's hut. It was neatly laid out with his kitchen utensils. 
There were some fairly basic cupboards and shelves, and a basic bed 
in the corner. A door at the back of the room led to something Trillian 
couldn't see because the door was closed. "Nice," she said, but in an 
enquiring tone of voice. She couldn't quite make out what the set-up 
was. 

"Very nice," said Arthur. "Wonderfully nice. I don't know when I've 
ever been anywhere nicer. I'm happy here. They like me, I make 
sandwiches for them, and... er, well that's it really. They like me and I 
make sandwiches for them." 

"Sounds, er..." 

"Idyllic," said Arthur, firmly. "It is. It really is. I don't expect you'd 
like it very much, but for me it's, well, it's perfect. Look, sit down, 
please, make yourself comfortable. Can I get you anything, er, a 
sandwich?" 

Trillian picked up a sandwich and looked at it. She sniffed it 
carefully. 

"Try it," said Arthur, "it's good." 

Trillian took a nibble, then a bite and munched on it thoughtfully. 

"It is good," she said, looking at it. 

"My life's work," said Arthur, trying to sound proud and hoping he 
didn't sound like a complete idiot. He was used to being revered a bit, 
and was having to go through some unexpected mental gear changes. 

"What's the meat in it?" asked Trillian. 

"Ah yes, that's, um, that's Perfectly Normal Beast." 

"It's what?" 

"Perfectly Normal Beast. It's a bit like a cow, or rather a bull. Kind 
of like a buffalo in fact. Large, charging sort of animal." 

"So what's odd about it?" 

"Nothing, it's Perfectly Normal." 

"I see." 

"It's just a bit odd where it comes from." 

Tricia frowned, and stopped chewing. 

"Where does it come from?" she asked with her mouth full. She 
wasn't going to swallow until she knew. 



"Well it's not just a matter of where it comes from, it's also where 
it goes to. It's all right, it's perfectly safe to swallow. I've eaten tons of 
it. It's great. Very succulent. Very tender. Slightly sweet flavour with a 
long dark finish." 

Trillian still hadn't swallowed. 

"Where," she said, "does it come from, and where does it go to?" 

"They come from a point just slightly to the east of the Hondo 
Mountains. They're the big ones behind us here, you must have seen 
them as you came in, and then they sweep in their thousands across 
the great Anhondo plains and, er, well that's it really. That's where 
they come from. That's where they go." 

Trillian frowned. There was something she wasn't quite getting 
about this. 

"I probably haven't made it quite clear," said Arthur. "When I say 
they come from a point to the east of the Hondo Mountains, I mean 
that that's where they suddenly appear. Then they sweep across the 
Anhondo plains and, well, vanish really. We have about six days to 
catch as many of them as we can before they disappear. In the spring 
they do it again only the other way round, you see." 

Reluctantly, Trillian swallowed. It was either that or spit it out, and 
it did in fact taste pretty good. 

"I see," she said, once she had reassured herself that she didn't 
seem to be suffering any ill effects. "And why are they called Perfectly 
Normal Beasts?" 

"Well, I think because otherwise people might think it was a bit odd. 
I think Old Thrashbarg called them that. He says that they come from 
where they come from and they go to where they go to and that it's 
Bob's will and that's all there is to it." 

"Who..." 

"Just don't even ask." 

"Well, you look well on it." 

"I feel well. You look well." 

"I'm well. I'm very well." 

"Well, that's good." 

"Yes." 

"Good." 



"Good." 

"Nice of you to drop in." 

"Thanks." 

"Well," said Arthur, casting around himself. Astounding how hard it 
was to think of anything to say to someone after all this time. 

"I expect you're wondering how I found you," said Trillian. 

"Yes!" said Arthur. "I was wondering exactly that. How did you find 
me?" 

"Well, as you may or may not know, I now work for one of the big 
Sub-Etha broadcasting networks that - " 

"I did know that," said Arthur, suddenly remembering. "Yes, you've 
done very well. That's terrific. Very exciting. Well done. Must be a lot 
of fun." 

"Exhausting." 

"All that rushing around. I expect it must be, yes." 

"We have access to virtually every kind of information. I found your 
name on the passenger list of the ship that crashed." 

Arthur was astonished. 

"You mean they knew about the crash?" 

"Well, of course they knew. You don't have a whole spaceliner 
disappear without someone knowing about it." 

"But you mean, they knew where it had happened? They knew I'd 
survived?" 

"Yes." 

"But nobody's ever been to look or search or rescue. There's been 
absolutely nothing." 

"Well there wouldn't be. It's a whole complicated insurance thing. 
They just bury the whole thing. Pretend it never happened. The 
insurance business is completely screwy now. You know they've 
reintroduced the death penalty for insurance company directors?" 

"Really?" said Arthur. "No I didn't. For what offence?" 

Trillian frowned. 

"What do you mean, offence?" 

"I see." 



Trillian gave Arthur a long look, and then, in a new tone of voice, 
said, "It's time for you to take responsibility, Arthur." 

Arthur tried to understand this remark. He found it often took a 
moment or so before he saw exactly what it was that people were 
driving at, so he let a moment or two pass at a leisurely rate. Life was 
so pleasant and relaxed these days, there was time to let things sink 
in. He let it sink in. 

He still didn't quite understand what she meant, though, so in the 
end he had to say so. 

Trillian gave him a cool smile and then turned back to the door of 
the hut. 

"Random?" she called. "Come in. Come and meet your father." 



Chapter 14 


As the Guide folded itself back into a smooth, dark disk. Ford 
realised some pretty hectic stuff. Or at least he tried to realise it, but 
it was too hectic to take in all in one go. His head was hammering, his 
ankle was hurting, and though he didn't like to be a wimp about his 
ankle, he always found that intense multi-dimensional logic was 
something he understood best in the bath. He needed time to think 
about this. Time, a tall drink, and some kind of rich, foamy oil. 

He had to get out of here. He had to get the Guide out of here. He 
didn't think they'd make it together. 

He glanced wildly round the room. 

Think, think, think. It had to be something simple and obvious. If he 
was right in his nasty lurking suspicion that he was dealing with nasty, 
lurking Vogons, then the more simple and obvious the better. 

Suddenly he saw what he needed. 

He wouldn't try to beat the system, he would just use it. The 
frightening thing about the Vogons was their absolute mindless 
determination to do whatever mindless thing it was they were 
determined to do. There was never any point in trying to appeal to 
their reason because they didn't have any. However, if you kept your 
nerve you could sometimes exploit their blinkered, bludgeoning 
insistence on being bludgeoning and blinkered. It wasn't merely that 
their left hand didn't always know what their right hand was doing, so 
to speak; quite often their right hand had a pretty hazy notion as well. 

Did he dare just post the thing to himself? 

Did he dare just put it in the system and let the Vogons work out 
how to get the thing to him while at the same time they were busy, as 
they probably would be, tearing the building apart to find out where 
he'd hidden it? 


Yes. 



Feverishly, he packed it. He wrapped it. He labelled it. With a 
moment's pause to wonder if he was really doing the right thing, he 
committed the package to the building's internal mail chute. 

"Colin," he said, turning to the little, hovering ball. "I am going to 
abandon you to your fate." 

"I'm so happy," said Colin. 

"Make the most of it," said Ford. "Because what I want you to do is 
to nursemaid that package out of the building. They'll probably 
incinerate you when they find you, and I won't be here to help. It will 
be very, very nasty for you, and that's just too bad. Got it?" 

"I gurgle with pleasure," said Colin. 

"Go!" said Ford. 

Colin obediently dived down the mail chute in pursuit of his charge. 
Now Ford had only himself to worry about, but that was still quite a 
substantial worry. There were noises of heavy running footsteps 
outside the door, which he had taken the precaution of locking and 
shifting a large filing cabinet in front of. 

He was worried that everything had gone so smoothly. Everything 
had fitted terribly well. He had hurtled through the day with reckless 
abandon and yet everything had worked out with uncanny neatness. 
Except for his shoe. He was bitter about his shoe. That was an account 
that was going to have to be settled. 

With a deafening roar the door exploded inwards. In the turmoil of 
smoke and dust he could see large, slug-like creatures hurrying 
through. 

So everything was going well was it? Everything was working out as 
if the most extraordinary luck was on his side? Well, he'd see about 
that. 

In a spirit of scientific enquiry he hurled himself out of the window 
again. 



Chapter 15 


The first month, getting to know each other, was a little difficult. 

The second month, trying to come to terms with what they'd got to 
know about each other in the first month, was much easier. 

The third month, when the box arrived, was very tricky indeed. 

At the beginning, it was a problem even trying to explain what a 
month was. This had been a pleasantly simple matter for Arthur, here 
on Lamuella. The days were just a little over twenty-five hours long, 
which basically meant an extra hour in bed every single day and, of 
course, having regularly to reset his watch, which Arthur rather 
enjoyed doing. 

He also felt at home with the number of suns and moons which 
Lamuella had - one of each - as opposed to some of the planets he'd 
fetched up on from time to time which had had ridiculous numbers of 
them. 

The planet orbited its single sun every three hundred days, which 
was a good number because it meant the year didn't drag by. The 
moon orbited Lamuella just over nine times a year, which meant that 
a month was a little over thirty days, which was absolutely perfect 
because it gave you a little more time to get things done in. It was not 
merely reassuringly like Earth, it was actually rather an improvement. 

Random, on the other hand, thought she was trapped in a 
recurring nightmare. She would have crying fits and think the moon 
was out to get her. Every night it was there, and then, when it went, 
the sun came out and followed her. Over and over again. 

Trillian had warned Arthur that Random might have some difficulty 
in adjusting to a more regular lifestyle than she had been used to up 
till now, but Arthur hadn't been ready for actual howling at the moon. 

He hadn't been ready for any of this of course. 

His daughter? 



His daughter? He and Trillian had never even - had they? He was 
absolutely convinced he would have remembered. What about 
Zaphod? 

"Not the same species, Arthur," Trillian had answered. "When I 
decided I wanted a child they ran all sorts of genetic tests on me and 
could find only one match anywhere. It was only later that it dawned 
on me. I double checked and I was right. They don't usually like to tell 
you, but I insisted." 

"You mean you went to a DNA bank?" Arthur had asked, pop-eyed. 

"Yes. But she wasn't quite as random as her name suggests, 
because, of course, you were the only homo sapiens donor. I must say, 
though, it seems you were quite a frequent flyer." 

Arthur had stared wide-eyed at the unhappy looking girl who was 
slouching awkwardly in the door-frame looking at him. 

"But when... how long...?" 

"You mean, what age is she?" 

"Yes." 

"The wrong one." 

"What do you mean?" 

"I mean that I haven't any idea." 

"What?" 

"Well, in my time line I think it's about ten years since I had her, 
but she's obviously quite a lot older than that. I spend my life going 
backwards and forwards in time, you see. The job. I used to take her 
with me when I could, but it just wasn't always possible. Then I used 
to put her into day care time zones, but you just can't get reliable 
time tracking now. You leave them there in the morning, you've 
simply no idea how old they'll be in the evening. You complain till 
you're blue in the face but it doesn't get you anywhere. I left her at 
one of the places for a few hours once, and when I came back she'd 
passed puberty. I've done all I can, Arthur, it's over to you. I've got a 
war to cover." 

The ten seconds that passed after Trillian left were about the 
longest of Arthur Dent's life. Time, we know, is relative. You can travel 
light years through the stars and back, and if you do it at the speed of 
light then, when you return, you may have aged mere seconds while 



your twin brother or sister will have aged twenty, thirty, forty or 
however many years it is, depending on how far you travelled. 

This will come to you as a profound personal shock, particularly if 
you didn't know you had a twin brother or sister. The seconds that 
you have been absent for will not have been sufficient time to 
prepare you for the shock of new and strangely distended family 
relationships when you return. 

Ten seconds silence was not enough time for Arthur to reassemble 
his whole view of himself and his life in a way that suddenly included 
an entire new daughter of whose merest existence he had had not 
the slightest inkling of a suspicion when he had woken that morning. 
Deep, emotional family ties cannot be constructed in ten seconds, 
however far and fast you travel away from them, and Arthur could 
only feel helpless, bewildered and numb as he looked at the girl 
standing in his doorway, staring at his floor. 

He supposed that there was no point in pretending not to be 
hopeless. 

He walked over and he hugged her. 

"I don't love you," he said. "I'm sorry. I don't even know you yet. 

But give me a few minutes." 

We live in strange times. 

We also live in strange places: each in a universe of our own. The 
people with whom we populate our universes are the shadows of 
whole other universes intersecting with our own. Being able to glance 
out into this bewildering complexity of infinite recursion and say 
things like, "Oh, hi Ed! Nice tan. How's Carol?" involves a great deal of 
filtering skill for which all conscious entities have eventually to 
develop a capacity in order to protect themselves from the 
contemplation of the chaos through which they seethe and tumble. 

So give your kid a break, OK? 

Extract from Practical Parenting in a 

Fractally Demented Universe. 

"What's this?" 

Arthur had almost given up. That is to say, he was not going to give 
up. He was absolutely not going to give up. Not now. Not ever. But if 



he had been the sort of person who was going to give up, this was 
probably the time he would have done it. 

Not content with being surly, bad-tempered, wanting to go and 
play in the paleozoic era, not seeing why they had to have the gravity 
on the whole time and shouting at the sun to stop following her. 
Random had also used his carving knife to dig up stones to throw at 
the pikka birds for looking at her like that. 

Arthur didn't even know if Lamuella had had a paleozoic era. 
According to Old Thrashbarg the planet had been found fully-formed 
in the navel of a giant earwig at four-thirty one Vroonday afternoon, 
and although Arthur, as a seasoned galactic traveller with good "O" 
level passes in Physics and Geography, had fairly serious doubts about 
this, it was rather a waste of time trying to argue with Old Thrashbarg 
and there had never been much point before. 

He sighed as he sat nursing the chipped and bent knife. He was 
going to love her if it killed him, or her, or both. It wasn't easy being a 
father. He knew that no one had ever said it was going to be easy, but 
that wasn't the point because he'd never asked about being one in 
the first place. 

He was doing his best. Every moment that he could wrest away 
from making sandwiches he was spending with her, talking to her, 
walking with her, sitting on the hill with her watching the sun go 
down over he valley in which the village nestled, trying to find out 
about her life, trying to explain to her about his. It was a tricky 
business. The common ground between them, apart from the fact 
that they had almost identical genes, was about the size of a pebble. 
Or rather, it was about the size of Trillian and of her they had slightly 
differing views. 

"What's this?" 

He suddenly realised she had been talking to him and he hadn't 
noticed. Or rather he had not recognized her voice. 

Instead of the usual tone of voice in which she spoke to him, which 
was bitter and truculent, she was just asking him a simple question. 

He looked round in surprise. 

She was sitting there on a stool in the corner of the hut in that 
rather hunched way she had, knees together, feet splayed out, with 



her dark hair hanging down over her face as she looked at something 
she had cradled in her hands. 

Arthur went over to her, a little nervously. 

Her mood swings were very unpredictable but so far they'd all 
been between different types of bad ones. Outbreaks of bitter 
recrimination would give way without warning to abject self-pity and 
then long bouts of sullen despair which were punctuated with sudden 
acts of mindless violence against inanimate objects and demands to 
go to electric clubs. 

Not only were there no electric clubs on Lamuella, there were no 
clubs at all and, in fact, no electricity. There was a forge and a bakery, 
a few carts and a well, but those were the high water mark of 
Lamuellan technology, and a fair number of Random's unquenchable 
rages were directed against the sheer incomprehensible 
backwardness of the place. 

She could pick up Sub-Etha TV on a small Flex-O-Panel which had 
been surgically implanted in her wrist, but that didn't cheer her up at 
all because it was full of news of insanely exciting things happening in 
every other part of the Galaxy than here. It would also give her 
frequent news of her mother, who had dumped her to go off and 
cover some war which now seemed not to have happened, or at least 
to have gone all wrong in some way because of the absence of any 
proper intelligence gathering. It also gave her access to lots of great 
adventure shows featuring all sorts of fantastically expensive 
spaceships crashing into each other. 

The villagers were absolutely hypnotised by all these wonderful 
magic images flashing over her wrist. They had only ever seen one 
spaceship crash, and it had been so frightening, violent and shocking 
and had caused so much horrible devastation, fire and death that, 
stupidly, they had never realised it was entertainment. 

Old Thrashbarg had been so astonished by it that he had instantly 
seen Random as an emissary from Bob, but had fairly soon afterwards 
decided that in fact she had been sent as a test of his faith, if not of 
his patience. He was also alarmed at the number of spaceship crashes 
he had to start incorporating into his holy stories if he was to hold the 
attention of the villagers, and not have them rushing off to peer at 
Random's wrist all the time. 



At the moment she was not peering at her wrist. Her wrist was 
turned off. Arthur squatted down quietly beside her to see what she 
was looking at. 

It was his watch. He had taken it off when he'd gone to shower 
under the local waterfall, and Random had found it and was trying to 
work it out. 

"It's just a watch," he said. "It's to tell the time." 

"I know that," she said. "But you keep on fiddling with it, and it still 
doesn't tell the right time. Or even anything like it." 

She brought up the display on her wrist panel, which automatically 
produced a readout of local time. Her wrist panel had quietly got on 
with the business of measuring the local gravity and orbital 
momentum, and had noticed where the sun was and tracked its 
movement in the sky, all within the first few minutes of Random's 
arrival. It had then quickly picked up clues from its environment as to 
what the local unit conventions were and reset itself appropriately. It 
did this sort of thing continually, which was particularly valuable if 
you did a lot of travelling in time as well as space. 

Random frowned at her father's watch, which didn't do any of this. 

Arthur was very fond of it. It was a better one than he would ever 
have afforded himself. He had been given it on his twenty-second 
birthday by a rich and guilt-ridden godfather who had forgotten every 
single birthday he had had up till then, and also his name. It had the 
day, the date, the phases of the moon; it had "To Albert on his 
twenty-first birthday" and the wrong date engraved on the battered 
and scratched surface of its back in letters that were still just about 
visible. 

The watch had been through a considerable amount of stuff in the 
last few years, most of which would fall well outside the warranty. He 
didn't suppose, of course, that the warranty had especially mentioned 
that the watch was guaranteed to be accurate only within the very 
particular gravitational and magnetic fields of the Earth, and so long 
as the day was twenty-four hours long and the planet didn't explode 
and so on. These were such basic assumptions that even the lawyers 
would have missed them. 

Luckily his watch was a wind-up one, or at least, a self-winder. 
Nowhere else in the Galaxy would he have found batteries of 



precisely the dimensions and power specifications that were perfectly 
standard on Earth. 

"So what are all these numbers?" asked Random. 

Arthur took it from her. 

"These numbers round the edge mark the hours. In the little 
window on the right it says THU, which means Thursday, and the 
number is 14, which means it's the fourteenth day of the month of 
MAY which is what it says in this window over here. 

"And this sort of crescent-shaped window at the top tells you 
about the phases of the moon. In other words it tells you how much 
of the moon is lit up at night by the sun, which depends on the 
relative positions of the Sun and the Moon and, well... the Earth." 

"The Earth," said Random. 

"Yes." 

"And that's where you came from, and where Mum came from." 

"Yes." 

Random took the watch back from him and looked at it again, 
clearly baffled by something. Then she held it up to her ear and 
listened in puzzlement. 

"What's that noise?" 

"It's ticking. That's the mechanism that drives the watch. It's called 
clockwork. It's all kind of interlocking cogs and springs that work to 
turn the hands round at exactly the right speed to mark the hours and 
minutes and days and so on." 

Random carried on peering at it. 

"There's something puzzling you," said Arthur. "What is it?" 

"Yes," said Random, at last. "Why's it all in hardware?" 

Arthur suggested they went for a walk. He felt there were things 
they should discuss, and for once Random seemed, if not precisely 
amenable and willing, then at least not growling. 

From Random's point of view this was also all very weird. It wasn't 
that she wanted to be difficult, as such, it was just that she didn't 
know how or what else to be. 

Who was this guy? What was this life she was supposed to lead? 
What was this world she was supposed to lead it in? And what was 



this universe that kept coming at her through her eyes and ears? 

What was it for? What did it want? 

She'd been born in a spaceship that had been going from 
somewhere to somewhere else, and when it had got to somewhere 
else, somewhere else had only turned out to be another somewhere 
that you had to get to somewhere else again from, and so on. 

It was her normal expectation that she was supposed to be 
somewhere else. It was normal for her to feel that she was in the 
wrong place. 

Then, constant time travel had only compounded this problem, and 
had led to the feeling that she was not only always in the wrong place, 
but she was also almost always there at the wrong time. 

She didn't notice that she felt this, because it was the only way she 
ever felt, just as it never seemed odd to her that nearly everywhere 
she went she needed either to wear weights or anti-gravity suits and 
usually special apparatus for breathing as well. The only places you 
could ever feel right were worlds you designed for yourself to inhabit- 
virtual realities in the electric clubs. It had never occurred to her that 
the real Universe was something you could actually fit into. 

And that included this Lamuella place her mother had dumped her 
in. And it also included this person who had bestowed on her this 
precious and magical gift of life in return for a seat upgrade. It was 
just as well he had turned out to be rather kind and friendly or there 
would have been trouble. Really. She'd got a specially sharpened 
stone in her pocket she could cause a lot of trouble with. 

It can be very dangerous to see things from somebody else's point 
of view without the proper training. 

They sat on the spot that Arthur particularly liked, on the side of a 
hill overlooking the valley. The sun was going down over the village. 

The only thing that Arthur wasn't quite so fond of was being able to 
see a little way into the next valley, where a deep dark mangled 
furrow in the forest marked the spot where his ship had crashed. But 
maybe that was what kept bringing him back here. There were plenty 
of spots from which you could survey the lush rolling countryside of 
Lamuella, but this was the one he was drawn to, with its nagging dark 
spot of fear and pain nestling just on the edge of his vision. 



He had never been there again since he had been pulled out of the 
wreckage. 

Wouldn't. 

Couldn't bear it. 

In fact he had gone some of the way back to it the very next day, 
while he was still numb and spinning with shock. He had a broken leg, 
a couple of broken ribs, some bad burns and was not really thinking 
coherently but had insisted that the villagers take him, which, 
uneasily, they had. He had not managed to get right to the actual spot 
where the ground had bubbled and melted, however, and had at last 
hobbled away from the horror for ever. 

Soon, word had got around that the whole area was haunted and 
no one had ventured back there ever since. The land was full of 
beautiful, verdant and delightful valleys - no point in going to a highly 
worrying one. Let the past hold on to itself and let the present move 
forward into the future. 

Random cradled the watch in her hands, slowly turning it to let the 
long light of the evening sun shine warmly in the scratches and scuffs 
of the thick glass. It fascinated her watching the spidery little second 
hand ticking its way round. Every time it completed a full circle, the 
longer of the two main hands had moved on exactly to the next of the 
sixty small divisions round the dial. And when the long hand had 
made its own full circle, the smaller hand had moved on to the next of 
the main digits. 

"You've been watching it for over an hour." said Arthur, quietly. 

"I know, she said. "An hour is when the big hand has gone all the 
way round, yes?" 

"That's right." 

"Then I've been watching it for an hour and seventeen... minutes." 

She smiled with a deep and mysterious pleasure and moved very 
slightly so that she was resting just a little. Against his arm. Arthur felt 
a small sigh escape from him that had been pent up inside his chest 
for weeks. He wanted to put his arm around his daughter's shoulders, 
but felt it was too early yet and that she would shy away from him. 

But something was working. Something was easing inside her. The 
watch meant something to her that nothing in her life had so far 



managed to do. Arthur was not sure that he had really understood 
what it was yet, but he was profoundly pleased and relieved that 
something had reached her. 

"Explain to me again," said Random. 

"There's nothing really to it," said Arthur. "Clockwork was 
something that developed over hundreds of years..." 

"Earth years." 

"Yes. It became finer and finer and more and more intricate. It was 
highly skilled and delicate work. It had to be made very small, and it 
had to carry on working accurately however much you waved it 
around or dropped it." 

"But only on one planet?" 

"Well, that was where it was made, you see. It was never expected 
to go anywhere else and deal with different suns and moons and 
magnetic fields and things. I mean the thing still goes perfectly well, 
but it doesn't really mean much this far from Switzerland." 

"From where?" 

"Switzerland. That's where these were made. Small hilly country. 
Tiresomely neat. The people who made them didn't really know there 
were other worlds." 

"Quite a big thing not to know." 

"Well, yes." 

"So where did they come from?" 

"They, that is we... we just sort of grew there. We evolved on the 
Earth. From, I don't know, some kind of sludge or something." 

"Like this watch." 

"Urn. I don't think the watch grew out of sludge." 

"You don't understand!" 

Random suddenly leaped to her feet, shouting. 

"You don't understand! You don't understand me, you don't 
understand anything! I hate you for being so stupid!" 

She started to run hectically down the hill, still clutching the watch 
and shouting that she hated him. 

Arthur jumped up, startled and at a loss. Fie started to run after her 
through the stringy and clumpy grass. It was hard and painful for him. 
When he had broken his leg in the crash, it had not been a clean 



break, and it had not healed cleanly. He was stumbling and wincing as 
he ran. 

Suddenly she turned and faced him, her face dark with anger. 

She brandished the watch at him. "You don't understand that 
there's somewhere this belongs? Somewhere it works? Somewhere 
that it fits?" 

She turned and ran again. She was fit and fleet-footed and Arthur 
could not remotely keep up with her. 

It wasn't that he had not expected being a father to be this difficult, 
it was that he hadn't expected to be a father at all, particularly not 
suddenly and unexpectedly on an alien planet. 

Random turned to shout at him again. For some reason he stopped 
each time she did. 

"Who do you think I am?" she demanded angrily. "Your upgrade? 
Who do you think Mum thought I was? Some sort of ticket to the life 
she didn't have?" 

"I don't know what you mean by that," said Arthur, panting and 
hurting. 

"You don't know what anybody means by anything!" 

"What do you mean?" 

"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!" 

"Tell me! Please tell me! What does she mean by saying the life she 
didn't have?" 

"She wished she'd stayed on Earth! She wished she hadn't gone off 
with that stupid brain-dead fruit gum, Zaphod! She thinks she would 
have had a different life!" 

"But," said Arthur, "she would have been killed! She would have 
been killed when the world was destroyed!" 

"That's a different life isn't it?" 

"That’s..." 

"She wouldn't have had to have me! She hates me!" 

"You can't mean that! How could anyone possibly, er, I mean..." 

"She had me because I was meant to make things fit for her. That 
was my job. But I fitted even worse than she did! So she just shut me 
off and carried on with her stupid life." 



"What's stupid about her life? She's fantastically successful, isn't 
she? She's all over time and space, all over the Sub-Etha TV 
networks..." 

"Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!" 

Random turned and ran off again. Arthur couldn't keep up with her 
and at last he had to sit down for a bit and let the pain in his leg 
subside. The turmoil in his head he didn't know what to do with at all. 

He hobbled into the village an hour later. It was getting dark. The 
villagers he passed said hello, but there was a sense of nervousness 
and of not quite knowing what was going on or what to do about it in 
the air. Old Thrashbarg had been seen pulling on his beard a fair bit 
and looking at the moon, and that was not a good sign either. 

Arthur went into his hut. 

Random was sitting hunched quietly over the table. 

"I'm sorry," she said. "I'm so sorry." 

"That's all right," said Arthur as gently as he knew how. "It's good 
to, well, to have a little chat. There's so much we have to learn and 
understand about each other, and life isn't, well it isn't all just tea and 
sandwiches..." 

"I'm so sorry," she said again, sobbing. 

Arthur went up to her and put his arm round her shoulder. She 
didn't resist or pull away. Then Arthur saw what it was she was so 
sorry about. 

In the pool of light thrown by a Lamuellan lantern lay Arthur's 
watch. Random had forced the back off it with the back edge of the 
butter spreading knife, and all of the minute cogs and springs and 
levers were lying in a tiny cock-eyed mess where she'd been fiddling 
with them. 

"I just wanted to see how it worked," said Random, "how it all 
fitted together. I'm so sorry! I can't get it back together. I'm sorry, I'm 
sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know what to do. I'll get it repaired! Really! I'll 
get it repaired!" 

The following day Thrashbarg came round and said all sorts of Bob 
stuff. He tried to exert a calming influence by inviting Random to let 
her mind dwell on the ineffable mystery of the giant earwig, and 



Random said there was no giant earwig and Thrashbarg went very 
cold and silent and said she would be cast into outer darkness. 
Random said good, she'd been born there, and the next day the 
parcel arrived. 

This was all getting a bit eventful. 

In fact, when the parcel arrived, delivered by a kind of robot drone 
that dropped out of the sky making droning robot noises, it brought 
with it a sense which gradually began to permeate through the whole 
village, that it was almost one event too many. 

It wasn't the robot drone's fault. All it required was Arthur Dent's 
signature or thumb print, or just a few scrapings of skin cells from the 
nape of his neck and it would be on its way again. It hung around 
waiting, not quite sure what all this resentment was about. 
Meanwhile, Kirp had caught another fish with a head at both ends, 
but on closer inspection it turned out that it was in fact two fish cut in 
half and sewn together rather badly, so not only had Kirp failed to 
rekindle any great interest in two-headed fish but he had seriously 
cast doubt on the authenticity of the first one. Only the pikka birds 
seemed to feel that everything was exactly normal. 

The robot drone got Arthur's signature and made its escape. Arthur 
bore the parcel back to his hut and sat and looked at it. 

"Let's open it!" said Random, who was feeling much more cheerful 
this morning now that everything around her had got thoroughly 
weird, but Arthur said no. 

"Why not?" 

"It's not addressed to me." 

"Yes, it is." 

"No, it isn't. It's addressed to... well, it's addressed to Ford Prefect, 
in care of me." 

"Ford Prefect? Is he the one who..." 

"Yes," said Arthur tartly. 

"I've heard about him." 

"I expect you have." 

"Let's open it anyway. What else are we going to do?" 



"I don't know," said Arthur, who really wasn't sure. He had taken 
his damaged knives over to the forge bright and early that morning 
and Strinder had had a look at them and said that he would see what 
he could do. 

They had tried the usual business of waving the knives through the 
air, feeling for the point of balance and the point of flex and so on, 
but the joy was gone from it, and Arthur had a sad feeling that his 
sandwich making days were probably numbered. 

He hung his head. 

The next appearance of the Perfectly Normal Beasts was imminent, 
but Arthur felt that the usual festivities of hunting and feasting were 
going to be rather muted and uncertain. Something had happened 
here on Lamuella, and Arthur had a horrible feeling that it was him. 

"What do you think it is?" urged Random, turning the parcel over in 
her hands. 

"I don't know, said Arthur. "Something bad and worrying, though." 

"How do you know?" Random protested. 

"Because anything to do with Ford Prefect is bound to be worse 
and more worrying than something that isn't," said Arthur. "Believe 
me." 

"You're upset about something, aren't you?" said Random. 

Arthur sighed. 

"I'm just feeling a little jumpy and unsettled, I think," said Arthur. 

"I'm sorry," said Random, and put the package down again. She 
could see that it really would upset him if she opened it. She would 
just have to do it when he wasn't looking. 



Chapter 16 


Arthur wasn't quite certain which he noticed as being missing first. 
When he noticed that the one wasn't there his mind instantly leapt to 
the other and he knew immediately that they were both gone and 
that something insanely bad and difficult to deal with would happen 
as a result. 

Random was not there. And neither was the parcel. 

He had left it up on a shelf all day, in plain view. It was an exercise 
in trust. 

He knew that one of the things he was supposed to do as a parent 
was to show trust in his child, to build a sense of trust and confidence 
into the bedrock of relationship between them. He had had a nasty 
feeling that that might be an idiotic thing to do, but he did it anyway, 
and sure enough it had turned out to be an idiotic thing to do. You 
live and learn. At any rate, you live. 

You also panic. 

Arthur ran out of the hut. It was the middle of the evening. The 
light was getting dim and a storm was brewing. He could not see her 
anywhere, nor any sign of her. He asked. No one had seen her. He 
asked again. No one else had seen her. They were going home for the 
night. A little wind was whipping round the edge of the village, picking 
things up and tossing them around in a dangerously casual manner. 

He found Old Thrashbarg and asked him. Thrashbarg looked at him 
stonily, and then pointed in the one direction that Arthur had 
dreaded, and had therefore instinctively known was the way she 
would have gone. 

So now he knew the worst. 

She had gone where she thought he would not follow her. 

He looked up at the sky, which was sullen, streaked and livid, and 
reflected that it was the sort of sky that the Four Horsemen of the 
Apocalypse wouldn't feel like a bunch of complete idiots riding out of. 



With a heavy sense of the utmost foreboding he set off on the 
track that led to the forest in the next valley. The first heavy blobs of 
rain began to hit the ground as Arthur tried to drag himself to some 
sort of run. Random reached the crest of the hill and looked down 
into the next valley. It had been a longer and harder climb than she 
had anticipated. She was a little worried that doing the trip at night 
was not that great an idea, but her father had been mooching around 
near the hut all day trying to pretend to either her or himself that he 
wasn't guarding the parcel. At last he'd had to go over to the forge to 
talk with Strinder about the knives, and Random had seized her 
opportunity and done a runner with the parcel. 

It was perfectly clear that she couldn't just open the thing there, in 
the hut, or even in the village. He might have come across her at any 
moment. Which meant that she had to go where she wouldn't be 
followed. 

She could stop where she was now. She had gone this way in the 
hope that he wouldn't follow her. And even if he did he would never 
find her up in the wooded parts of the hill with night drawing in and 
the rain starting. 

All the way up, the parcel had been jiggling under her arm. It was a 
satisfyingly hunky sort of thing: a box with a square top about the 
length of her forearm on each side, and about the length of her hand 
deep, wrapped up in brown plasper with an ingenious new form of 
self-knotting string. It didn't rattle as she shook it, but she sensed that 
its weight was concentrated excitingly at the centre. 

Having come so far, though, there was a certain satisfaction in not 
stopping here, but carrying on down into what seemed to be almost a 
forbidden area - where her father's ship had come down. She wasn't 
exactly certain what the word "haunted" meant, but it might be fun 
to find out. She would keep going and save the parcel up for when 
she got there. 

It was getting darker, though. She hadn't used her tiny electric 
torch yet, because she didn't want to be visible from a distance. She 
would have to use it now, but it probably didn't matter since she 
would be on the other side of the hill which divided the valleys from 
each other. 

She turned her torch on. Almost at the same moment a fork of 
lightning ripped across the valley into which she was heading and 



startled her considerably. As the darkness shuddered back around her 
and a clap of thunder rolled out across the land she felt suddenly 
rather small and lost with just a feeble pencil of light bobbing in her 
hand. Perhaps she should stop after all and open the parcel here. Or 
maybe she should go back and come out again tomorrow. It was only 
a momentary hesitation, though. She knew there was no going back 
tonight, and sensed that there was no going back ever. 

She headed on down the side of the hill. The rain was beginning to 
pick up now. Where a short while ago it had been a few heavy blobs it 
was settling in for a good pour now, hissing in the trees, and the 
ground was getting slippery under her feet. 

At least, she thought it was the rain hissing in the trees. Shadows 
were leaping and leering at her as her light bobbed through the trees. 
Onwards and downwards. 

She hurried on for another ten or fifteen minutes, soaked to the 
skin now and shivering, and gradually became aware that there 
seemed to be some other light somewhere ahead of her. It was very 
faint and she wasn't certain if she was imagining it or not. She turned 
off her torch to see. There did seem to be some sort of dim glow 
ahead. She couldn't tell what it was. She turned her torch back on and 
continued down the hill, towards whatever it was. 

There was something wrong with the woods though. 

She couldn't immediately say what it was, but they didn't seem like 
sprightly healthy woods looking forward to a good spring. The trees 
were lolling at sickly angles and had a sort of pallid, blighted look 
about them. Random more than once had the worrying sensation that 
they were trying to reach towards her as she passed them, but it was 
just a trick of the way that her light caused their shadows to flicker 
and lurch. 

Suddenly, something fell out of a tree in front of her. She leapt 
backwards with alarm, dropping both the torch and the box as she did 
so. She went down into a crouch, pulling the specially sharpened rock 
out of her pocket. 

The thing that had fallen out of the tree was moving. The torch was 
lying on the ground and pointing towards it, and a vast, grotesque 
shadow was slowly lurching through the light towards her. She could 
hear faint rustling and screeching noises over the steady hiss of the 



rain. She scrabbled on the ground for the torch, found it, and shone it 
directly at the creature. 

At the same moment another dropped from a tree just a few feet 
away. She swung the torch wildly from one to another. She held her 
rock up, ready to throw. 

They were quite small in fact. It was the angle of the light that had 
made them loom so large. Not only small. But small, furry and cuddly. 
And there was another, dropping from the trees. It fell through the 
beam of light, so she saw it quite clearly. 

It fell neatly and precisely, turned, and then, like the other two, 
started slowly and purposefully to advance on Random. 

She stayed rooted to the spot. She still had her rock. Poised and 
ready to throw, but was increasingly conscious of the fact that the 
things she had it poised and ready to throw at were squirrels. Or at 
least, squirrel-like things. Soft, warm, cuddly squirrel-like things 
advancing on her in a way she wasn't at all certain she liked. 

She shone her torch directly on the first of them. It was making 
aggressive, hectoring, screeching noises, and carrying in one of its 
little fists a small tattered piece of wet, pink rag. Random hefted her 
rock menacingly in her hand, but it made no impression at all on the 
squirrel advancing on her with its wet piece of rag. 

She backed away. She didn't know at all how to deal with this. If 
they had been vicious snarling slavering beasts with glistening fangs 
she would have pitched into them with a will, but squirrels behaving 
like this she couldn't quite handle. 

She backed away again. The second squirrel was starting to make a 
flanking manoeuvre round to her right. Carrying a cup. Some kind of 
acorn thing. The third was right behind it and making its own advance. 
What was it carrying? Some little scrap of soggy paper. Random 
thought. 

She stepped back again, caught her ankle against the root of a tree 
and fell over backwards. 

Instantly the first squirrel darted forward and was on top of her, 
advancing along her stomach with cold purpose. In its eyes, and a 
piece of wet rag in its fist. 

Random tried to jump up, but only managed to jump about an inch. 
The startled movement of the squirrel on her stomach startled her in 



return. The squirrel froze, gripping her skin through her soaking shirt 
with its tiny claws. Then slowly, inch by inch, it made its way up her, 
stopped, and proffered her the rag. 

She felt almost hypnotised by the strangeness of the thing and its 
tiny glinting eyes. It proffered her the rag again. It pushed it at her 
repeatedly, screeching insistently, till at last, nervously, hesitantly, she 
took the thing from it. It continued to watch her intently, its eyes 
darting all over her face. She had no idea what to do. Rain and mud 
were streaming down her face and she had a squirrel sitting on her. 
She wiped some mud out of her eyes with the rag. 

The squirrel shrieked triumphantly, grabbed the rag back, leapt off 
her, ran scampering into the dark, enclosing night, darted up into a 
tree, dived into a hole in the trunk, settled back and lit a cigarette. 

Meanwhile Random was trying to fend off the squirrel with the 
acorn cup full of rain and the one with the paper. She shuffled 
backwards on her bottom. 

"No!" she shouted. "Go away!" 

They darted back, in fright, and then darted right forward again 
with their gifts. She brandished her rock at them. "Go!" she yelled. 

The squirrels scampered round in consternation. Then one darted 
straight at her, dropped the acorn cup in her lap, turned and ran off 
into the night. The other stood quivering for a moment, then put its 
scrap of paper neatly down in front of her and disappeared as well. 

She was alone again, but trembling with confusion. She got 
unsteadily to her feet, picked up her rock and her parcel, then paused 
and picked up the scrap of paper as well. It was so soggy and 
dilapidated it was hard to make out what it was. It seemed just to be 
a fragment of an in-flight magazine. 

Just as Random was trying to understand exactly what it was that 
this all meant, a man walked out into the clearing in which she was 
standing, raised a vicious-looking gun and shot her. 

Arthur was thrashing around hopelessly two or three miles behind 
her, on the upward side of the hill. 

Within minutes of setting out he had gone back again and 
equipped himself with a lamp. Not an electric one. The only electric 
light in the place was the one that Random had brought with her. This 



was a kind of dim hurricane lamp: a perforated metal canister from 
Strinder's forge, which contained a reservoir of inflammable fish oil, a 
wick of knotted dried grass and was wrapped in a translucent film 
made from dried membranes from the gut of a Perfectly Normal 
Beast. 

It had now gone out. 

Arthur jiggled around with it in a thoroughly pointless kind of a way 
for a few seconds. There was clearly no way he was going to get the 
thing suddenly to burst into flame again in the middle of a rainstorm, 
but it's impossible not to make a token effort. Reluctantly he threw 
the thing aside. 

What to do? This was hopeless. He was absolutely sodden, his 
clothes heavy and billowing with the rain, and now he was lost in the 
dark as well. 

For a brief second he was lost in the blinding light, and then he was 
lost in the dark again. 

The sheet of lightning had at least shown him that he was very 
close to the brow of the hill. Once he had breasted that he would... 
well, he wasn't certain what he would do. He'd have to work that out 
when he got there. 

He limped forward and upwards. 

A few minutes later he knew that he was standing panting at the 
top. There was some kind of dim glow in the distance below him. He 
had no idea what it was, and indeed he hardly liked to think. It was 
the only thing he had to make towards, though, so he started to make 
his way, stumbling, lost and frightened towards it. 

The flash of lethal light passed straight through Random and, about 
two seconds later, so did the man who had shot it. Other than that he 
paid her no attention whatsoever. He had shot someone standing 
behind her, and when she turned to look, he was kneeling over the 
body and going through its pockets. 

The tableau froze and vanished. It was replaced a second later by a 
giant pair of teeth framed by immense and perfectly glossed red lips. 
A huge blue brush appeared out of nowhere and started foamily to 
scrub at the teeth, which continued to hang there gleaming in the 
shimmering curtain of rain. 



Random blinked at it twice before she got it. 

It was a commercial. The guy who had shot her was part of a 
holographic in-flight movie. She must now be very close to where the 
ship had crashed. Obviously some of its systems were more 
indestructible than others. 

The next half-mile of the journey was particularly troublesome. Not 
only did she have the cold and the rain and the night to contend with, 
but also the fractured and thrashing remains of the ship's on-board 
entertainment system. Spaceships and jetcars and helipods crashed 
and exploded continuously around her, illuminating the night, 
villainous people in strange hats smuggled dangerous drugs through 
her, and the combined orchestra and chorus of the Hallapolis State 
Opera performed the closing March of the AnjaQantine Star Guard 
from Act IV of Rizgar's Blamwellamum of Woont in a little glade 
somewhere off to her left. 

And then she was standing on the lip of a very nasty looking and 
bubbly-edged crater. There was still a faint warm glow coming from 
what would otherwise have looked like an enormous piece of 
caramelised chewing gum in the centre of the pit: the melted remains 
of a great spaceship. 

She stood looking at it for a longish while, and then at last started 
to walk along and around the edge of the crater. She was no longer 
certain what she was looking for, but kept moving anyway, keeping 
the horror of the pit to her left. 

The rain was beginning to ease off a little, but it was still extremely 
wet, and since she didn't know what it was that was in the box, 
whether it was perhaps something delicate or damageable, she 
thought she ought to find somewhere reasonably dry to open it. She 
hoped she hadn't already damaged it by dropping it. 

She played her torch around the surrounding trees, which were 
thin on the ground here, and mostly charred and broken. In the 
middle distance she thought she could see a jumbled outcrop of rock 
which might provide some shelter, and she started to pick her way 
towards it. All around she found the detritus that had been ejected 
from the ship as it broke up, before the final fireball. 

After she had moved two or three hundred yards from the edge of 
the crater she came across the tattered fragments of some fluffy pink 
material, sodden, muddied and drooping amongst the broken trees. 



She guessed, correctly, that this must be the remains of the escape 
cocoon that had saved her father's life. She went and looked at it 
more closely, and then noticed something close to it on the ground, 
half covered in mud. 

She picked it up and wiped the mud off it. It was some kind of 
electronic device the size of a small book. Feebly glowing on its cover, 
in response to her touch, were some large friendly letters. They said 
DON'T PANIC. She knew what this was. It was her father's copy of The 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 

She felt instantly reassured by it, turned her head up to the 
thundery sky and let some. Rain wash over her face and into her 
mouth. 

She shook her head and hurried on towards the rocks. Clambering 
up and over them she almost immediately found the perfect thing. 
The mouth of a cave. She played her torch into its interior. It seemed 
to be dry and safe. Picking her way carefully, she walked in. It was 
quite spacious, but didn't go that deep. Exhausted and relieved she 
sat on a convenient rock, put the box down in front of her and started 
immediately to open it. 



Chapter 17 


For a long period of time there was much speculation and 
controversy about where the so-called "missing matter" of the 
Universe had got to. All over the Galaxy the science departments of 
all the major universities were acquiring more and more elaborate 
equipment to probe and search the hearts of distant galaxies, and 
then the very centre and the very edges of the whole Universe, but 
when eventually it was tracked down it turned out in fact to be all the 
stuff which the equipment had been packed in. 

There was quite a large quantity of missing matter in the box, little 
soft round white pellets of missing matter, which Random discarded 
for future generations of physicists to track down and discover all 
over again once the findings of the current generation of physicists 
had been lost and forgotten about. 

Out of the pellets of missing matter she lifted the featureless black 
disk. She put it down on a rock beside her and sifted amongst all the 
missing matter to see if there was anything else, a manual or some 
attachments or something, but there was nothing else at all. Just the 
black disk. 

She shone the torch on it. 

As she did so, cracks began to appear along its apparently 
featureless surface. Random backed away nervously, but then saw 
that the thing, whatever it was, was merely unfolding itself. 

The process was wonderfully beautiful. It was extraordinarily 
elaborate but also simple and elegant. It was like a piece of self¬ 
opening origami, or a rosebud blooming into a rose in just a few 
seconds. 

Where just a few moments earlier there had been a smoothly 
curved black disk there was now a bird. A bird, hovering there. 

Random continued to back away from it, carefully and watchfully. 

It was a little like a pikka bird, only rather smaller. That is to say, in 
fact it was larger, or to be more exact, precisely the same size or, at 



least, not less than twice the size. It was also both a lot bluer and a lot 
pinker than pikka birds, while at the same time being perfectly black. 

There was also something very odd about it, which Random 
couldn't immediately make out. 

It certainly shared with pikka birds the impression it gave that it 
was watching something that you couldn't see. 

Suddenly it vanished. 

Then, just as suddenly everything went black. Random dropped 
into a tense crouch, feeling for the specially sharpened rock in her 
pocket again. Then the blackness receded and rolled itself up into a 
ball and then the blackness was the bird again. It hung in the air in 
front of her, beating its wings slowly and staring at her. 

"Excuse me," it said suddenly, "I just have to calibrate myself. Can 
you hear me when I say this?" 

"When you say what?" demanded Random. 

"Good," said the bird. "And can you hear me when I say this?" It 
spoke this time at a much higher pitch. 

"Yes, of course I can!" said Random. 

"And can you hear me when I say this?" it said, this time in a 
sepulchrally deep voice. 

"Yes!" 

There was then a pause. 

"No obviously not," said the bird after a few seconds. "Good, well 
your hearing range is obviously between 20 and 16 KHz. So. Is this 
comfortable for you?" it said in a pleasant light tenor. "No 
uncomfortable harmonics screeching away in the upper register? 
Obviously not. Good. I can use those as data channels. Now. How 
many of me can you see?" 

Suddenly the air was full of nothing but interlocking birds. Random 
was well used to spending time in virtual realities, but this was 
something far weirder than anything she had previously encountered. 
It was as if the whole geometry of space was redefined in seamless 
bird shapes. 

Random gasped and flung her arms round her face, her arms 
moving through bird-shaped space. 



"Hmmm, obviously way too many," said the bird. "How about 
now?" 

It concertinaed into a tunnel of birds, as if it was a bird caught 
between parallel mirrors, reflecting infinitely into the distance. 

"What are you?" shouted Random. 

"We'll come to that in a minute," said the bird. "Just how many, 
please?" 

"Well, you're sort of..." Random gestured helplessly off into the 
distance. 

"I see, still infinite in extent, but at least we're homing in on the 
right dimensional matrix. Good. No, the answer is an orange and two 
lemons." 

"Lemons?" 

"If I have three lemons and three oranges and I lose two oranges 
and a lemon what do I have left?" 

"Huh?" 

"OK, so you think that time flows that way, do you? Interesting. Am 
I still infinite?" it asked, ballooning this way and that in space. "Am I 
infinite now? How yellow am I?" 

Moment by moment the bird was going through mind-mangling 
transformations of shape and extent. 

"I can't..." said Random bewildered. 

"You don't have to answer, I can tell from watching you now. So. 
Am I your mother? Am I a rock? Do I seem huge, squishy and 
sinuously intertwined? No? How about now? Am I going backwards?" 

For once the bird was perfectly still and steady. 

"No," said Random. 

"Well I was in fact, I was moving backwards in time. Hmmm. Well I 
think we've sorted all that out now. If you'd like to know, I can tell you 
that in your universe you move freely in three dimensions that you 
call space. You move in a straight line in a fourth, which you call time, 
and stay rooted to one place in a fifth, which is the first fundamental 
of probability. After that it gets a hit complicated, and there's all sorts 
of stuff going on in dimensions 13 to 22 that you really wouldn't want 
to know about. All you really need to know for the moment is that the 
universe is a lot more complicated than you might think, even if you 



start from a position of thinking it's pretty damn complicated in the 
first place. I can easily not say words like 'damn' if it offends you." 

"Say what you damn well like." 

"I will." 

"What the hell are you?" demanded Random. 

"I am The Guide. In your universe I am your Guide. In fact I inhabit 
what is technically known as the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash 
which means... well, let me show you." 

It turned in mid-air and swooped out of the cave, and then perched 
on a rock, just beneath an overhang, out of the rain, which was 
getting heavier again. 

"Come on," it said, "watch this." 

Random didn't like being bossed around by a bird, but she followed 
it to the mouth of the cave anyway, still fingering the rock in her 
pocket. 

"Rain," said the bird. "You see? Just rain." 

"I know what rain is." 

Sheets of the stuff were sweeping through the night, moonlight 
sifting through it. 

"So what is it?" 

"What do you mean, what is it? Look, who are you? What were you 
doing in that box? Why have I spent a night running through the 
forest fending off demented squirrels to find that all I've got at the 
end of it is a bird asking me what rain is. It's just water falling through 
the bloody air, that's what it is. Anything else you want to know or 
can we go home now?" 

There was a long pause before the bird answered, "You want to go 
home?" 

"I haven't got a home!" Random almost shocked herself, she 
screamed the words so loudly. 

"Look into the rain..." said the bird Guide. 

"I'm looking into the rain! What else is there to look at?" 

"What do you see?" 

"What do you mean, you stupid bird? I just see a load of rain. It's 
just water, falling." 

"What shapes do you see in the water?" 



"Shapes? There aren't any shapes. It's just, just..." 

"Just a mish mash," said the bird Guide. 

"Yes..." 

"Now what do you see?" 

Just on the very edge of visibility a thin faint beam fanned out of 
the bird's eyes. In the dry air beneath the overhang there was nothing 
to see. Where the beam hit the drops of rain as they fell through it, 
there was a flat sheet of light, so bright and vivid it seemed solid. 

"Oh great. A laser show," said Random fractiously. "Never seen one 
of those before, of course, except at about five million rock concerts." 

"Tell me what you see!" 

"Just a flat sheet! Stupid bird." 

"There's nothing there that wasn't there before. I'm just using light 
to draw your attention to certain drops at certain moments. Now 
what do you see?" 

The light shut off. 

"Nothing." 

"I'm doing exactly the same thing, but with ultra-violet light. You 
can't see it." 

"So what's the point of showing me something I can't see?" 

"So that you understand that just because you see something, it 
doesn't mean to say it's there. And if you don't see something it 
doesn't mean to say it's not there, it's only what your senses bring to 
your attention." 

"I'm bored with this," said Random, and then gasped. 

Hanging in the rain was a giant and very vivid three-dimensional 
image of her father looking startled about something. 

About two miles away behind Random, her father, struggling his 
way through the woods suddenly stopped. He was startled to see an 
image of himself looking startled about something hanging brightly in 
the rain-filled air about two miles away. About two miles away some 
distance to the right of the direction in which he was heading. 

He was almost completely lost, convinced he was going to die of 
cold and wet and exhaustion and beginning to wish he could just get 



on with it. He had just been brought an entire golfing magazine by a 
squirrel, as well, and his brain, was beginning to howl and gibber. 

Seeing a huge bright image of himself light up in the sky told him 
that, on balance, he was probably right to howl and gibber but 
probably wrong as far as the direction he was heading was concerned. 

Taking a deep breath, he turned and headed off towards the 
inexplicable light show. 

"OK, so what's that supposed to prove?" demanded Random. It 
was the fact that the image was her father that had startled her 
rather than the appearance of the image itself. She had seen her first 
hologram when she was two months old and had been put in it to 
play. She had seen her most recent one about half an hour ago 
playing the March of the AnjaQantine Star Guard. 

"Only that it's no more there or not there than the sheet was," said 
the bird. "It's just the interaction of water from the sky moving in one 
direction, with light at frequencies your senses can detect moving in 
another. It makes an apparently solid image in your mind. But it's all 
just images in the Mish Mash. Here's another one for you." 

"My mother!" said Random. 

"No," said the bird. 

"I know my mother when I see her!" 

The image was of a woman emerging from a spacecraft inside a 
large, grey hangar-like building. She was being escorted by a group of 
tall, thin purplish-green creatures. It was definitely Random's mother. 
Well, almost definitely. Trillian wouldn't have been walking quite so 
uncertainly in low gravity, or looking around her at a boring old life- 
support environment with quite such a disbelieving look on her face, 
or carrying such a quaint old camera. 

"So who is it?" demanded Random. 

"She is part of the extent of your mother on the probability axis," 
said the bird Guide. 

"I haven't the faintest idea what you mean." 

"Space, time and probability all have axes along which it is possible 
to move." 

"Still dunno. Though I think... No. Explain." 



"I thought you wanted to go home." 

"Explain!" 

"Would you like to see your home?" 

"See it? It was destroyed!" 

"It is discontinuous along the probability axis. Look!" 

Something very strange and wonderful now swam into view in the 
rain. It was a huge, bluish-greenish globe, misty and cloud-covered, 
turning with, majestic slowness against a black, starry background. 

"Now you see it," said the bird. "Now you don't." 

A little less than two miles away, now, Arthur Dent stood still in his 
tracks. He could not believe what he could see, hanging there, 
shrouded in rain, but brilliant and vividly real against the night sky - 
the Earth. He gasped at the sight of it. Then, at the moment he 
gasped, it disappeared again. Then it appeared again. Then, and this 
was the bit that made him give up and stick straws in his hair, it 
turned into a sausage. 

* * * 

Random was also startled by the sight of this huge, blue and green 
and watery and misty sausage hanging above her. And now it was a 
string of sausages, or rather it was a string of sausages in which many 
of the sausages were missing. The whole brilliant string turned and 
span in a bewildering dance in the air and then gradually slowed, 
grew insubstantial and faded into the glistening darkness of the night. 

"What was that?" asked Random, in a small voice. 

"A glimpse along the probability axis of a discontinuously probable 
object." 

"I see." 

"Most objects mutate and change along their axis of probability, 
but the world of your origin does something slightly different. It lies 
on what you might call a fault line in the landscape of probability 
which means that at many probability co-ordinates, the whole of it 
simply ceases to exist. It has an inherent instability, which is typical of 
anything that lies within what are usually designated the Plural 
sectors. Make sense?" 

"No." 



"Want to go and see for yourself?" 

"To... Earth?" 

"Yes." 

"Is that possible?" 

The bird Guide did not answer at once. It spread its wings and, with 
an easy grace, ascended into the air and flew out into the rain which, 
once again, was beginning to lighten. 

It soared ecstatically up into the night sky, lights flashed around it, 
dimensions dithered in its wake. It swooped and turned and looped 
and turned again and came at last to rest two feet in front of 
Random's face, its wings beating slowly and silently. 

It spoke to her again. 

"Your universe is vast to you. Vast in time, vast in space. That's 
because of the filters through which you perceive it. But I was built 
with no filters at all, which means I perceive the mish mash which 
contains all possible universes but which has, itself, no size at all. For 
me, anything is possible. I am omniscient and omnipotent, extremely 
vain, and, what is more, I come in a handy self-carrying package. You 
have to work out how much of the above is true." 

A slow smile spread over Random's face. 

"You bloody little thing. You've been winding me up!" 

"As I said, anything is possible." 

Random laughed. "OK," she said. "Let's try and go to Earth. Let's go 
to Earth at some point on its, er..." 

"Probability axis?" 

"Yes. Where it hasn't been blown up. OK. So you're the Guide. How 
do we get a lift?" 

"Reverse engineering." 

"What?" 

"Reverse engineering. To me the flow of time is irrelevant. You 
decide what you want. I then merely make sure that it has already 
happened." 

"You're joking." 

"Anything is possible." 

Random frowned. "You are joking aren't you?" 



"Let me put it another way," said the bird. "Reverse engineering 
enables us to shortcut all the business of waiting for one of the 
horribly few spaceships that passes through your galactic sector every 
year or so to make up its mind about whether or not it feels like giving 
you a lift. You want a lift a ship arrives and gives you one. The pilot 
may think he has any one of a million reasons why he has decided to 
stop and pick you up. The real reason is that I have determined that 
he will." 

"This is you being extremely vain isn't it, little bird?" 

The bird was silent. 

"OK," said Random. "I want a ship to take me to Earth." 

"Will this one do?" 

It was so silent that Random had not noticed the descending 
spaceship until it was nearly on top of her. 

Arthur had noticed it. He was a mile away now and closing. Just 
after the illuminated sausage display had drawn to its conclusion he 
had noticed the faint glimmerings of further lights coming down out 
of the clouds and had, to begin with, assumed it to be another piece 
of flashy son et lumiere. 

It took a moment or so for it to dawn on him that it was an actual 
spaceship, and a moment or two longer for him to realise that it was 
dropping directly down to where he assumed his daughter to be. That 
was when, rain or no rain, leg injury or no leg injury, darkness or no 
darkness, he suddenly started really to run. 

He fell almost immediately, slid and hurt his knee quite badly on a 
rock. He slithered back up to his feet and tried again. He had a 
horrible cold feeling that he was about to lose Random for ever. 
Limping and cursing, he ran. He didn't know what it was that had 
been in the box, but the name on it had been Ford Prefect, and that 
was the name he cursed as he ran. 

The ship was one of the sexiest and most beautiful ones that 
Random had ever seen. 

It was astounding. Silver, sleek, ineffable. 

If she didn't know better she would have said it was an RW6. As it 
settled silently beside her she realised that it actually was an RW6 and 



she could scarcely breathe for excitement. An RW6 was the sort of 
thing you only saw in the sort of magazines that were designed to 
provoke civil unrest. 

She was also extremely nervous. The manner and timing of its 
arrival was deeply unsettling. Either it was the most bizarre 
coincidence or something very peculiar and worrying was going on. 
She waited a little tensely for the ship's hatch to open. Her Guide - 
she thought of it as hers now - was hovering lightly over her right 
shoulder, its wings barely fluttering. 

The hatch opened. Just a little dim light escaped. A moment or two 
passed and a figure emerged. He stood still for a moment or so, 
obviously trying to accustom his eyes to the darkness. Then he caught 
sight of Random standing there, and seemed a little surprised. He 
started to walk towards her. Then suddenly he shouted in surprise 
and started to run at her. 

Random was not a good person to take a run at on a dark night 
when she was feeling a little strung out. She had unconsciously been 
fingering the rock in her pocket from the moment she saw the craft 
coming down. 

Still running, slithering, hurtling, bumping into trees, Arthur saw at 
last that he was too late. The ship had only been on the ground for 
about three minutes, and now, silently, gracefully it was rising up 
above the trees again, turning smoothly in the fine speckle of rain to 
which the storm had now abated, climbing, climbing, tipping up its 
nose and, suddenly, effortlessly, hurtling up through the clouds. 

Gone. Random was in it. It was impossible for Arthur to know this, 
but he just went ahead and knew it anyway. She was gone. He had 
had his stint at being a parent and could scarcely believe how badly 
he had done at it. He tried to continue running, but his feet were 
dragging, his knee was hurting like fury and he knew that he was too 
late. 

He could not conceive that he could feel more wretched and awful 
than this, but he was wrong. 

He limped his way at last to the cave where Random had sheltered 
and opened the box. The ground bore the indentations of the 
spacecraft that had landed there only minutes before, but of Random 
there was no sign. He wandered disconsolately into the cave, found 



the empty box and piles of missing matter pellets strewn around the 
place. He felt a little cross about that. He'd tried to teach her about 
cleaning up after herself. Feeling a bit cross with her about something 
like that helped him feel less desolate about her leaving. He knew he 
had no means of finding her. 

His foot knocked against something unexpected. He bent down to 
pick it up, and was thoroughly surprised to discover what it was. It 
was his old Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. How did that come to be 
in the cave? He had never returned to collect it from the scene of the 
crash. He had not wanted to revisit the crash and he had not wanted 
the Guide again. He had reckoned he was here on Lamuella, making 
sandwiches for good. How did it come to be in the cave? It was active. 
The words on the cover flashed DON'T PANIC at him. 

He went out of the cave again into the dim and damp moonlight. 

He sat on a rock to have a look through the old Guide, and then 
discovered it wasn't a rock, it was a person. 



Chapter 18 


Arthur leapt to his feet with a start of fear. It would be hard to say 
which he was more frightened of: that he might have hurt the person 
he had inadvertently sat on or that the person he had inadvertently 
sat on would hurt him back. 

There seemed, on inspection, to be little immediate cause for 
alarm on the second count. Whoever it was he had sat on was 
unconscious. That would probably go a great deal of the way towards 
explaining what he was doing lying there. He seemed to be breathing 
OK, though. Arthur felt his pulse. That was OK as well. 

He was lying on his side, half curled up. It was so long ago and far 
away when Arthur had last done First Aid that he really couldn't 
remember what it was he was supposed to do. The first thing he was 
supposed to do, he remembered, was to have a First Aid kit about his 
person. Damn. 

Should he roll him on to his back or not? Suppose he had any 
broken bones? Suppose he swallowed his tongue? Suppose he sued 
him? Who, apart from anything else, was he? 

At that moment the unconscious man groaned loudly and rolled 
himself over. 

Arthur wondered if he should. 

He looked at him. 

He looked at him again. 

He looked at him again, just to make absolutely sure. 

Despite the fact that he had been thinking he was feeling about as 
low as he possibly could, he experienced a terrible sinking feeling. 

The figure groaned again and slowly opened his eyes. It took him a 
while to focus, then he blinked and stiffened. 

"You!" said Ford Prefect. 

"You!" said Arthur Dent. 

Ford groaned again. 



"What do you need to have explained this time?" he said, and 
closed his eyes in some kind of despair. 

* * * 

Five minutes later he was sitting up and rubbing the side of his 
head, where he had quite a large swelling. 

"Who the hell was that woman?" he said. "Why are we surrounded 
by squirrels, and what do they want?" 

"I've been pestered by squirrels all night," said Arthur. "They keep 
on trying to give me magazines and stuff." 

Ford frowned. "Really?" he said. 

"And bits of rag." 

Ford thought. 

"Oh," he said. "Is this near where your ship crashed?" 

"Yes," said Arthur. Fie said it a little tightly. 

"That's probably it. Can happen. Ship's cabin robots get destroyed. 
The cyberminds that control them survive and start infesting the local 
wildlife. Can turn a whole ecosystem into some kind of helpless 
thrashing service industry, handing out hot towels and drinks to 
passers-by. Should be a law against it. Probably is. Probably also a law 
against there being a law against it so everybody can get nice and 
worked up. Fley ho. What did you say?" 

"I said, and the woman is my daughter." 

Ford stopped rubbing his head. 

"Say that one more time." 

"I said," said Arthur huffily, "the woman is my daughter." 

"I didn't know," said Ford, "that you had a daughter." 

"Well, there's probably a lot you don't know about me," said Arthur. 
"Come to mention it, there's probably a lot I don't know about me 
either." 

"Well, well, well. When did this happen then?" 

"I'm not quite sure." 

"That sounds like more familiar territory," said Ford. "Is there a 
mother involved?" 

"Trillian." 

"Trillian? I didn't think that..." 



"No. Look, it's a bit embarrassing." 

"I remember she told me once she had a kid but only, sort of, in 
passing. I'm in touch with her from time to time. Never seen her with 
the kid." 

Arthur said nothing. 

Ford started to feel the side of his head again in some bemusement. 

"Are you sure this was your daughter?" he said. 

"Tell me what happened." 

"Phroo. Long story. I was coming to pick up this parcel I'd sent to 
myself here care of you..." 

"Well, what was that all about?" 

"I think it may be something unimaginably dangerous." 

"And you sent it to me?" protested Arthur. 

"Safest place I could think of. I thought I could rely on you to be 
absolutely boring and not open it. Anyway, coming in at night I 
couldn't find this village place. I was going by pretty basic information. 

I couldn't find any signal of any kind. I guess you don't have signals 
and stuff here." 

"That's what I like about it." 

"Then I did pick up a faint signal from your old copy of the Guide, 
so I homed in on that, thinking that would take me to you. I found I'd 
landed in some kind of wood. Couldn't figure out what was going on. I 
get out, and then see this woman standing there. I go up to say hello, 
then suddenly I see that she's got this thing!" 

"What thing?" 

"The thing I sent you! The new Guide! The bird thing! You were 
meant to keep it safe, you idiot, but this woman had the thing right 
there by her shoulder. I ran forward and she hit me with a rock." 

"I see," said Arthur. "What did you do?" 

"Well, I fell over of course. I was very badly hurt. She and the bird 
started to make off towards my ship. And when I say my ship, I mean 
an RW6." 

"A what?" 

"An RW6 for Zark's sake. I've got this great relationship going now 
between my credit card and the Guide's central computer. You would 
not believe that ship, Arthur, it's..." 



"So an RW6 is a spaceship, then?" 

"Yes! It's - oh never mind. Look, just get some kind of grip will you, 
Arthur? Or at least get some kind of catalogue. At this point I was very 
worried. And, I think, semi-concussed. I was down on my knees and 
bleeding profusely, so I did the only thing I could think of, which was 
to beg. I said, please for Zark's sake don't take my ship. And don't 
leave me stranded in the middle of some primitive zarking forest with 
no medical help and a head injury. I could be in serious trouble and so 
could she." 

"What did she say?" 

"She hit me on the head with the rock again." 

"I think I can confirm that that was my daughter." 

"Sweet kid." 

"You have to get to know her," said Arthur. 

"She eases up does she?" 

"No," said Arthur, "but you get a better sense of when to duck." 

Ford held his head and tried to see straight. 

The sky was beginning to lighten in the west, which was where the 
sun rose. Arthur didn't particularly want to see it. The last thing he 
wanted after a hellish night like this one was some blasted day 
coming along and barging about the place. 

"What are you doing in a place like this, Arthur?" demanded Ford. 

"Well," said Arthur, "making sandwiches mostly." 

"What?" 

"I am, probably was, the sandwich maker for a small tribe. It was a 
bit embarrassing really. When I first arrived, that is, when they 
rescued me from the wreckage of this super high-technology 
spacecraft which had crashed on their planet, they were very nice to 
me and I thought I should help them out a bit. You know, I'm an 
educated chap from a high-technology culture, I could show them a 
thing or two. And of course I couldn't. I haven't got the faintest idea, 
when it comes down to it, of how anything actually works. I don't 
mean like video-recorders, nobody knows how to work those. I mean 
just something like a pen or an artesian well or something. Not the 
foggiest. I couldn't help at all. One day I got glum and made myself a 
sandwich. That suddenly got them all excited. They'd never seen one 
before. It was just an idea that had never occurred to them, and I 



happen to quite like making sandwiches, so it all sort of developed 
from there." 

"And you enjoyed that?" 

"Well, yes, I think I sort of did, really. Getting a good set of knives, 
that sort of thing." 

"You didn't, for instance, find it mind-witheringly, explosively, 
astoundingly, blisteringly dull?" 

"Well, er, no. Not as such. Not actually blisteringly." 

"Odd. I would." 

"Well, I suppose we have a different outlook." 

"Yes." 

"Like the pikka birds." 

Ford had no idea what he was talking about and couldn't be 
bothered to ask. Instead he said, "So how the hell do we get out of 
this place?" 

"Well I think the simplest way from here is just to follow the way 
down the valley to the plains, probably take an hour, and then walk 
round from there. I don't think I could face going back up and over 
the way I came." 

"Walk round where from there?" 

"Well, back to the village. I suppose." Arthur sighed a little forlornly. 

"I don't want to go to any blasted village!" snapped Ford. 

"We've got to get out of here!" 

"Where? How?" 

"I don't know, you tell me. You live here! There must be some way 
off this zarking planet." 

"I don't know. What do you usually do? Sit around and wait for a 
passing spacecraft, I suppose." 

"Oh yes? And how many spacecraft have visited this zark-forsaken 
little fleapit recently?" 

"Well, a few years ago there was mine that crashed here by 
mistake. Then there was, er, Trillian, then the parcel delivery, and 
now you, and..." 

"Yes, but apart from the usual suspects?" 



"Well, er, I think pretty much none, so far as I know. Pretty quiet 
round here." 

As if deliberately to prove him wrong, there was a long, low distant 
roll of thunder. 

Ford leapt to his feet fretfully and started pacing backwards and 
forwards in the feeble, painful light of the early dawn which lay 
streaked against the sky as if someone had dragged a piece of liver 
across it. 

"You don't understand how important this is," he said. 

"What? You mean my daughter out there all alone in the Galaxy? 
You think I don't..." 

"Can we feel sorry for the Galaxy later?" said Ford. "This is very, 
very serious indeed. The Guide has been taken over. It's been bought 
out." 

Arthur leapt up. "Oh very serious," he shouted. "Please fill me in 
straight away on some corporate publishing politics! I can't tell you 
how much it's been on my mind of late!" 

"You don't understand! There's a whole new Guide!" 

"Oh!" shouted Arthur again. "Oh! Oh! Oh! I'm incoherent with 
excitement! I can hardly wait for it to come out to find out which are 
the most exciting spaceports to get bored hanging about in some 
globular cluster I've never heard of. Please, can we rush to a store 
that's got it right this very instant?" 

Ford narrowed his eyes. 

"This is that thing you call sarcasm, isn't it?" 

"Do you know," bellowed Arthur, "I think it is? I really think it might 
just be a crazy little thing called sarcasm seeping in at the edges of my 
manner of speech! Ford, I have had a fucking bad night! Will you 
please try and take that into account while you consider what 
fascinating bits of badger-sputumly inconsequential trivia to assail me 
with next?" 

"Try to rest," said Ford. "I need to think." 

"Why do you need to think? Can't we just sit and go budum- 
budumbudum with our lips for a bit? Couldn't we just dribble gently 
and loll a little bit to the left for a few minutes? I can't stand it. Ford! I 
can't stand all this thinking and trying to work things out any more. 
You may think that I am just standing here barking..." 



"Hadn't occurred to me in fact." 

"...but I mean it! What is the point? We assume that every time we 
do anything we know what the consequences will be, i.e., more or 
less what we intend them to be. This is not only not always correct. It 
is wildly, crazily, stupidly cross-eyed-blithering-insectly wrong!" 

"Which is exactly my point." 

"Thank you," said Arthur, sitting down again. "What?" 

"Temporal reverse engineering." 

Arthur put his head in his hands and shook it gently from side to 
side. 

"Is there any humane way," he moaned, "in which I can prevent 
you from telling me what temporary reverse bloody-whatsiting is?" 

"No," said Ford, "because your daughter is caught up in the middle 
of it and it is deadly, deadly serious." 

Thunder rolled in the pause. 

"All right," said Arthur. "Tell me." 

"I leaped out of a high-rise office window." 

This cheered Arthur up. 

"Oh!" he said. "Why don't you do it again?" 

"I did." 

"Hmmm," said Arthur, disappointed. "Obviously no good came of 
it." 

"The first time I managed to save myself by the most astonishing 
and - I say this in all modesty - fabulous piece of ingenious quick¬ 
thinking, agility, fancy footwork and self-sacrifice." 

"What was the self-sacrifice?" 

"I jettisoned half of a much loved and I think irreplaceable pair of 
shoes." 

"Why was that self-sacrifice?" 

"Because they were mine!" said Ford crossly. 

"I think we have different value systems." 

"Well mine's better." 

"That's according to your... oh never mind. So having saved 
yourself very cleverly once you very sensibly went and jumped again. 
Please don't tell me why. Just tell me what happened if you must." 



"I fell straight into the open cockpit of a passing jet towncar whose 
pilot had just accidentally pushed the eject button when he meant 
only to change tracks on the stereo. Now, even I couldn't think that 
that was particularly clever of me." 

"Oh, I don't know," said Arthur wearily. "I expect you probably 
sneaked into his jetcar the previous night and set the pilot's least 
favourite track to play or something." 

"No, I didn't," said Ford. 

"Just checking." 

"Though oddly enough, somebody else did. And this is the nub. You 
could trace the chain and branches of crucial events and coincidences 
back and back. Turned out the new Guide had done it. That bird." 

"What bird?" 

"You haven't seen it?" 

"No." 

"Oh. It's a lethal little thing. Looks pretty, talks big, collapses 
waveforms selectively at will." 

"What does that mean?" 

"Temporal reverse engineering." 

"Oh," said Arthur. "Oh yes." 

"The question is, who is it really doing it for?" 

"I've actually got a sandwich in my pocket," said Arthur, delving. 
"Would you like a bit?" 

"Yeah, OK." 

"It's a bit squished and sodden. I'm afraid." 

"Never mind." 

They munched for a bit. 

"It's quite good in fact," said Ford. "What's the meat in it?" 

"Perfectly Normal Beast." 

"Not come across that one. So, the question is," Ford continued, 
"who is the bird really doing it for? What's the real game here?" 

"Mmm," ate Arthur. 

"When I found the bird," continued Ford, "which I did by a series of 
coincidences that are interesting in themselves, it put on the most 
fantastic multi-dimensional display of pyrotechnics I've ever seen. It 



then said that it would put its services at my disposal in my universe. I 
said, thanks but no thanks. It said that it would anyway, whether I 
liked it or not. I said just try it, and it said it would and, indeed, 
already had done. I said we'd see about that and it said that we would. 
That's when I decided to pack the thing up and get it out of there. So I 
sent it to you for safety." 

"Oh yes? Whose?" 

"Never you mind. Then, what with one thing and another, I thought 
it prudent to jump out of the window again, being fresh out of other 
options at the time. Luckily for me the jetcar was there otherwise I 
would have had to fall back on ingenious quick-thinking, agility, 
maybe another shoe or, failing all else, the ground. But it meant that, 
whether I liked it or not, the Guide was, well, working for me, and 
that was deeply worrying." 

"Why?" 

"Because if you've got the Guide you think that you are the one it's 
working for. Everything went swimmingly smoothly for me from then 
on, up to the very moment that I come up against the totty with the 
rock, then, bang, I'm history. I'm out of the loop." 

"Are you referring to my daughter?" 

"As politely as I can. She's the next one in the chain who will think 
that everything is going fabulously for her. She can beat whoever she 
likes around the head with bits of the landscape, everything will just 
swim for her until she's done whatever she's supposed to do and then 
it will be all up for her too. It's reverse temporal engineering, and 
clearly nobody understood what was being unleashed!" 

"Like me for instance." 

"What? Oh, wake up, Arthur. Look, let me try it again. The new 
Guide came out of the research labs. It made use of this new 
technology of Unfiltered Perception. Do you know what that means?" 

"Look, I've been making sandwiches for Bob's sake!" 

"Who's Bob?" 

"Never mind. Just carry on." 

"Unfiltered Perception means it perceives everything. Got that? I 
don't perceive everything. You don't perceive everything. We have 
filters. The new Guide doesn't have any sense filters. It perceives 



everything. It wasn't a complicated technological idea. It was just a 
question of leaving a bit out. Got it?" 

"Why don't I just say that I've got it, and then you can carry on 
regardless." 

"Right. Now because the bird can perceive every possible Universe 
it is present in every possible universe. Yes?" 

"Y... e... e... s. Ish." 

"So what happens is, the bozos in the marketing and accounting 
departments say, oh that sounds good, doesn't that mean we only 
have to make one of them and then sell it an infinite number of times? 
Don't squint at me like that, Arthur, this is how accountants think!" 

"That's quite clever, isn't it?" 

"No! It is fantastically stupid. Look. The machine's only a little 
Guide. It's got some quite clever cybertechnology in it, but because it 
has Unfiltered Perception, any smallest move it makes has the power 
of a virus. It can propagate throughout space, time and a million other 
dimensions. Anything can be focused anywhere in any of the 
universes that you and I move in. Its power is recursive. Think of a 
computer program. Somewhere, there is one key instruction, and 
everything else is just functions calling themselves, or brackets 
billowing out endlessly through an infinite address space. What 
happens when the brackets collapse? Where's the final 'end if'? Is any 
of this making sense? Arthur?" 

"Sorry, I was nodding off for a moment. Something about the 
Universe, yes?" 

"Something about the Universe, yes," said Ford, wearily. He sat 
down again. 

"All right," he said. "Think about this. You know who I think I saw at 
the Guide offices? Vogons. Ah. I see I've said a word you understand 
at last." 

Arthur leapt to his feet. 

"That noise," he said. 

"What noise?" 

"The thunder." 


"What about it?" 



"It isn't thunder. It's the spring migration of the Perfectly Normal 
Beasts. It's started." 

"What are these animals you keep on about?" 

"I don't keep on about them. I just put bits of them in sandwiches." 
"Why are they called Perfectly Normal Beasts?" 

Arthur told him. 

It wasn't often that Arthur had the pleasure of seeing Ford's eyes 
open wide with astonishment. 



Chapter 19 


It was a sight that Arthur never quite got used to, or tired of. He 
and Ford had tracked their way swiftly along the side of the small 
river that flowed down along the bed of the valley, and when at last 
they reached the margin of the plains they pulled themselves up into 
the branches of a large tree to get a better view of one of the stranger 
and more wonderful visions that the Galaxy has to offer. 

The great thunderous herd of thousand upon thousand of Perfectly 
Normal Beasts was sweeping in magnificent array across the Anhondo 
Plain. In the early pale light of the morning, as the great animals 
charged through the fine steam of the sweat of their bodies mingled 
with the muddy mist churned up by their pounding hooves, their 
appearance seemed a little unreal and ghostly anyway, but what was 
heart-stopping about them was where they came from and where 
they went to, which appeared to be, simply, nowhere. 

They formed a solid, charging phalanx roughly a hundred yards 
wide and half a mile long. The phalanx never moved, except that it 
exhibited a slight gradual drift sideways and backwards for the eight 
or nine days that it regularly appeared for. But though the phalanx 
stayed more or less constant, the great beasts of which it was 
composed charged steadily at upwards of twenty miles an hour, 
appearing suddenly from thin air at one end of the plain, and 
disappearing equally abruptly at the other end. 

No one knew where they came from, no one knew where they 
went. They were so important to the lives of the Lamuellans, it was 
almost as if nobody liked to ask. Old Thrashbarg had said on one 
occasion that some times if you received an answer, the question 
might be taken away. Some of the villagers had privately said that this 
was the only properly wise thing they'd ever heard Thrashbarg say, 
and after a short debate on the matter, had put it down to chance. 

The noise of the pounding of the hooves was so intense that it was 
hard to hear anything else above it. 



"What did you say?" shouted Arthur. 

"I said," shouted Ford, "this looks like it might be some kind of 
evidence of dimensional drift." 

"Which is what?" shouted Arthur back. 

"Well, a lot of people are beginning to worry that space/time is 
showing signs of cracking up with everything that's happening to it. 
There are quite a lot of worlds where you can see how the 
landmasses have cracked up and moved around just from the weirdly 
long or meandering routes that migrating animals take. This might be 
something like that. We live in twisted times. Still, in the absence of a 
decent spaceport..." 

Arthur looked at him in a kind of frozen way. 

"What do you mean?" he said. 

"What do you mean, what do I mean?" shouted Ford. "You know 
perfectly well what I mean. We're going to ride our way out of here." 

"Are you seriously suggesting we try to ride a Perfectly Normal 
Beast?" 

"Yeah. See where it goes to." 

"We'll be killed! No," said Arthur, suddenly. "We won't be killed. At 
least I won't. Ford, have you ever heard of a planet called Stavromula 
Beta?" 

Ford frowned. "Don't think so," he said. Fie pulled out his own 
battered old copy of the FHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and 
accessed it. "Any funny spelling?" he said. 

"Don't know. I've only ever heard it said, and that was by someone 
who had a mouthful of other people's teeth. You remember I told you 
about Agrajag?" 

Ford thought for a moment. "You mean the guy who was 
convinced you were getting him killed over and over again?" 

"Yes. One of the places he claimed I'd got him killed was 
Stavromula Beta. Someone tries to shoot me, it seems. I duck and 
Agrajag, or at least, one of his many reincarnations, gets hit. It seems 
that this has definitely happened at some point in time so, I suppose, I 
can't get killed at least until after I've ducked on Stavromula Beta. 

Only no one's ever heard of it." 

"Flmm." Ford tried a few other searches of the FHitchhiker's Guide, 
but drew a blank. 



"Nothing," he said. 

"I was just... no, I've never heard of it," said Ford finally. He 
wondered why it was ringing a very, very faint bell, though. 

"OK," said Arthur. "I've seen the way the Lamuellan hunters trap 
Perfectly Normal Beasts. If you spear one in the herd it just gets 
trampled, so they have to lure them out one at a time for the kill. It's 
very like the way a matador works, you know, with a brightly coloured 
cape. You get one to charge at you and then step aside and execute a 
rather elegant swing through with the cape. Have you got anything 
like a brightly coloured cape about you?" 

"This do?" said Ford, handing him his towel. 



Chapter 20 


Leaping on to the back of a one-and-a-half-ton Perfectly Normal 
Beast migrating through your world at a thundering thirty miles an 
hour is not as easy as it might at first seem. Certainly it is not as easy 
as the Lamuellan hunters made it seem, and Arthur Dent was 
prepared to discover that this might turn out to be the difficult bit. 

What he hadn't been prepared to discover, however, was how 
difficult it was even getting to the difficult bit. It was the bit that was 
supposed to be the easy bit which turned out to be practically 
impossible. 

They couldn't even catch the attention of a single animal. The 
Perfectly Normal Beasts were so intent on working up a good thunder 
with their hooves, heads down shoulders forward, back legs pounding 
the ground into porridge that it would have taken something not 
merely startling but actually geological to disturb them. 

The sheer amount of thundering and pending was, in the end, 
more than Arthur and Ford could deal with. After they had spent 
nearly two hours prancing about doing increasingly foolish things with 
a medium-sized floral patterned bath towel, they had not managed to 
get even one of the great beasts thundering and pounding past them 
to do so much as glance casually in their direction. 

They were within three feet of the horizontal avalanche of 
sweating bodies. To have been much nearer would have been to risk 
instant death, chronologic or no chronologic. Arthur had seen what 
remained of any Perfectly Normal Beast which, as the result of a 
clumsy misthrow by a young and inexperienced Lamuellan hunter, got 
speared while still thundering and pounding with the herd. 

One stumble was all it took. No prior appointment with death on 
Stavromula Beta, wherever the hell Stavromula Beta was, would save 
you or anybody else from the thunderous, mangling pounding of 
those hooves. 



At last, Arthur and Ford staggered back. They sat down, exhausted 
and defeated, and started to criticise each other's technique with the 
towel. 

"You've got to flick it more," complained Ford. "You need more 
follow-through from the elbow if you're going to get those blasted 
creatures to notice anything at all." 

"Follow-through?" protested Arthur. "You need more suppleness in 
the wrist." 

"You need more after-flourish," countered Ford. 

"You need a bigger towel." 

"You need," said another voice, "a pikka bird." 

"You what?" 

The voice had come from behind them. They turned, and there, 
standing behind them in the early morning sun, was Old Thrashbarg. 

"To attract the attention of a Perfectly Normal Beast," he said, as 
he walked forward towards them, "you need a pikka bird. Like this." 

From under the rough, cassocky robe-like thing he wore he drew a 
small pikka bird. It sat restlessly on Old Thrashbarg's hand and peered 
intently at Bob knows what darting around about three feet six inches 
in front of it. 

Ford instantly went into the sort of alert crouch he liked to do 
when he wasn't quite sure what was going on or what he ought to do 
about it. He waved his arms around very slowly in what he hoped was 
an ominous manner. 

"Who is this?" he hissed. 

"It's just Old Thrashbarg," said Arthur quietly. "And I wouldn't 
bother with all the fancy movements. He's just as experienced a 
bluffer as you are. You could end up dancing around each other all 
day." 

"The bird," hissed Ford again. "What's the bird?" 

"It's just a bird!" said Arthur impatiently. "It's like any other bird. It 
lays eggs and goes ark at things you can't see. Or kar or rit or 
something." 

"Have you seen one lay eggs?" said Ford, suspiciously. 



"For heaven's sake of course I have," said Arthur. "And I've eaten 
hundreds of them. Make rather a good omelette. The secret is little 
cubes of cold butter and then whipping it lightly with..." 

"I don't want a zarking recipe," said Ford. "I just want to be sure it's 
a real bird and not some kind of multi-dimensional cybernightmare." 

Fie slowly stood up from his crouched position and started to brush 
himself down. Fie was still watching the bird, though. 

"So," said Old Thrashbarg to Arthur. "Is it written that Bob shall 
once more take back unto himself the benediction of his once-given 
sandwich maker?" 

Ford almost went back into his crouch. 

"It's all right," muttered Arthur, "he always talks like that." Aloud, 
he said, "Ah, venerable Thrashbarg. Um, yes. I'm afraid I think I'm 
going to have to be popping off now. But young Drimple, my 
apprentice, will be a fine sandwich maker in my stead. Fie has the 
aptitude, a deep love of sandwiches, and the skills he has acquired so 
far, though rudimentary as yet, will, in time mature and, er, well, I 
think he'll work out OK is what I'm trying to say." 

Old Thrashbarg regarded him gravely. FHis old grey eyes moved 
sadly. Fie held his arms aloft, one still carrying a bobbing pikka bird, 
the other his staff. 

"O Sandwich Maker from Bob!" he pronounced. Fie paused, 
furrowed his brow, and sighed as he closed his eyes in pious 
contemplation. "Life," he said, "will be a very great deal less weird 
without you!" 

Arthur was stunned. 

"Do you know," he said, "I think that's the nicest thing anybody's 
ever said to me?" 

"Can we get on, please?" said Ford. 

Something was already happening. The presence of the pikka bird 
at the end of Thrashbarg's outstretched arm was sending tremors of 
interest through the thundering herd. The odd head flicked 
momentarily in their direction. Arthur began to remember some of 
the Perfectly Normal Beast hunts he had witnessed. Fie recalled that 
as well as the hunter-matadors brandishing their capes there were 
always others standing behind them holding pikka birds. Fie had 
always assumed that, like him, they had just come along to watch. 



Old Thrashbarg moved forward, a little closer to the rolling herd. 
Some of the Beasts were now tossing their heads back with interest at 
the sight of the pikka bird. 

Old Thrashbarg's outstretched arms were trembling. 

Only the pikka bird itself seemed to show no interest in what was 
going on. A few anonymous molecules of air nowhere in particular 
engaged all of its perky attention. 

"Now!" exclaimed Old Thrashbarg at last. "Now you may work 
them with the towel!" 

Arthur advanced with Ford's towel, moving the way the hunter- 
matadors did, with a kind of elegant strut that did not come at all 
naturally to him. But now he knew what to do and that it was right. 

He brandished and flicked the towel a few times, to be ready for the 
moment, and then he watched. 

Some distance away he spotted the Beast he wanted. Head down, 
it was galloping towards him, right on the very edge of the herd. Old 
Thrashbarg switched the bird, the Beast looked up, tossed its head, 
and then, just as its head was coming down again, Arthur flourished 
the towel in the Beast's line of sight. It tossed its head again in 
bemusement, and its eyes followed the movement of the towel. 

He had got the Beast's attention. 

From that moment on, it seemed the most natural thing to coax 
and draw the animal towards him. Its head was up, cocked slightly to 
one side. It was slowing to a canter and then a trot. A few seconds 
later the huge thing was standing there amongst them, snorting, 
panting, sweating, and sniffing excitedly at the pikka bird, which 
appeared not to have noticed its arrival at all. With strange sort of 
sweeping movements of his arms Old Thrashbarg kept the pikka bird 
in front of the Beast, but always out of its reach and always 
downwards. With strange sort of sweeping movements of the towel, 
Arthur kept drawing the Beast's attention this way and that - always 
downwards. 

"I don't think I've ever seen anything quite so stupid in my life," 
muttered Ford to himself. 

At last, the Beast dropped, bemused but docile, to its knees. 

"Go!" whispered Old Thrashbarg urgently, to Ford. "Go! Go now!" 



Ford leapt up on to the great creature's back, scrabbling amongst 
its thick knotty fur for purchase, grasping great handfuls of the stuff 
to hold him steady once he was in position. 

"Now, Sandwich Maker! Go!" He performed some elaborate sign 
and ritual handshake which Arthur couldn't quite get the hang of 
because Old Thrashbarg had obviously made it up on the spur of the 
moment, then he pushed Arthur forward. Taking a deep breath, he 
clambered up behind Ford on to the great, hot, heaving back of the 
beast and held on tight. Huge muscles the size of sea lions rippled and 
flexed beneath him. 

Old Thrashbarg held the bird suddenly aloft. The Beast's head 
swivelled up to follow it. Thrashbarg pushed upwards and upwards 
repeatedly with his arms and with the pikka bird; and slowly, heavily 
the Perfectly Normal Beast lurched up off its knees and stood, at last, 
swaying slightly. Its two riders held on fiercely and nervously. 

Arthur gazed out over the sea of hurtling animals, straining in an 
attempt to see where it was they were going, but there was nothing 
but heat haze. 

"Can you see anything?" he said to Ford. 

"No." Ford twisted round to glance back, trying to see if there was 
any clue as to where they had come from. Still, nothing. 

Arthur shouted down at Thrashbarg. 

"Do you know where they come from?" he called. "Or where 
they're going?" 

"The domain of the King!" shouted Old Thrashbarg back. 

"King?" shouted Arthur in surprise. "What King?" The Perfectly 
Normal Beast was swaying and rocking restlessly under him. 

"What do you mean, what King?" shouted Old Thrashbarg. "The 
King." 

"It's just that you never mentioned a King," shouted Arthur back, in 
some consternation. 

"What?" shouted Old Thrashbarg. The thrumming of a thousand 
hooves was very hard to hear over, and the old man was 
concentrating on what he was doing. 

Still holding the bird aloft, he led the Beast slowly round till it was 
once more parallel with the motion of its great herd. He moved 
forward. The Beast followed. He moved forward again. The Beast 



followed again. At last, the Beast was lumbering forward with a little 
momentum. 

"I said you never mentioned a King!" shouted Arthur again. 

"I didn't say a King," shouted Old Thrashbarg, "I said the King." 

He drew back his arm and then hurled it forward with all his 
strength, casting the pikka bird up into the air above the herd. This 
seemed to catch the pikka bird completely by surprise as it had 
obviously not been paying any attention at all to what was going on. It 
took it a moment or two to work out what was happening, then it 
unfurled its little wings, spread them out, and flew. 

"Go!" shouted Thrashbarg. "Go and meet your destiny, Sandwich 
Maker!" 

Arthur wasn't so sure about wanting to meet his destiny as such. 

He just wanted to get to wherever it was they were going so he could 
get back off this creature again. He didn't feel at all safe up there. The 
Beast was gathering speed as it followed in the wake of the pikka bird. 
And then it was in at the fringes of the great tide of animals, and in a 
moment or two, with its head down, the pikka bird forgotten, it was 
running with the herd again and rapidly approaching the point at 
which the herd was vanishing into thin air. Arthur and Ford held on to 
the great monster for dear life, surrounded on all sides by hurtling 
mountains of bodies. 

"Go! Ride that Beast!" shouted Thrashbarg. His distant voice 
reverberated faintly in their ears. "Ride that Perfectly Normal Beast! 
Ride it, ride it!" 

Ford shouted in Arthur's ear, "Where did he say we were going?" 

"He said something about a King," shouted Arthur in return, 
holding on desperately. 

"What King?" 

"That's what I said. He just said the King." 

"I didn't know there was a the King," shouted Ford. 

"Nor did I," shouted Arthur back. 

"Except of course for the King," shouted Ford. "And I don't suppose 
he meant him." 


"What King?" shouted Arthur. 



The point of exit was almost upon them. Just ahead of them. 
Perfectly Normal Beasts were galloping into nothingness and 
vanishing. 

"What do you mean, what King?" shouted Ford. "I don't know what 
King. I'm only saying that he couldn't possibly mean the King, so I 
don't know what he means." 

"Ford, I don't know what you're talking about." 

"So?" said Ford. Then with a sudden rush, the stars came on, 
turned and twisted around their heads, and then, just as suddenly, 
turned off again. 



Chapter 21 


Misty grey buildings loomed and flickered. They bounced up and 
down in a highly embarrassing way. 

What sort of buildings were they? 

What were they for? What did they remind her of? 

It's so difficult to know what things are supposed to be when you 
suddenly turn up unexpectedly on a different world which has a 
different culture, a different set of the most basic assumptions about 
life, and also incredibly dull and meaningless architecture. 

The sky above the buildings was a cold and hostile black. The stars, 
which should have been blindingly brilliant points of light this far from 
the sun were blurred and dulled by the thickness of the huge 
shielding bubble. Perspex or something like it. Something dull and 
heavy anyway. 

Tricia wound the tape back again to the beginning. 

She knew there was something slightly odd about it. 

Well, in fact, there were about a million things that were slightly 
odd about it, but there was one that was nagging at her and she 
hadn't quite got it. 

She sighed and yawned. 

As she waited for the tape to rewind she cleared away some of the 
dirty polystyrene coffee cups that had accumulated on the editing 
desk and tipped them into the bin. 

She was sitting in a small editing suite at a video production 
company in Soho. She had "DO NOT DISTURB" notices plastered all 
over the door, and a block on all incoming calls at the switch-board. 
This was originally to protect her astonishing scoop, but now it was to 
protect her from embarrassment. 

She would watch the tape all the way through again from the 
beginning. If she could bear to. She might do some fast forwarding 
here and there. 



It was about four o'clock on Monday afternoon, and she had a kind 
of sick feeling. She was trying to work out what the cause of this 
slightly sick feeling was, and there was no shortage of candidates. 

First of all, it had all come on top of the overnight flight from New 
York. The red eye. Always a killer, that. 

Then, being accosted by aliens on her lawn and flown to the planet 
Rupert. She was not sufficiently experienced in that sort of thing to be 
able to say for sure that that was always a killer, but she would be 
prepared to bet that those who went through it regularly cursed it. 
There were always stress charts being published in magazines. Fifty 
stress points for losing your job. Seventy-five points for a divorce or 
changing your hairstyle and so on. None of them ever mentioned 
being accosted on your lawn by aliens and then being flown to the 
planet Rupert, but she was sure it was worth a few dozen points. 

It wasn't that the journey had been particularly stressful. It had 
been extremely dull in fact. Certainly it had been no more stressful 
than the trip she had just taken across the Atlantic and it had taken 
roughly the same time, about seven hours. 

Well that was pretty astounding wasn't it? Flying to the outer limits 
of the solar system in the same time that it took to fly to New York 
meant they must have some fantastic unheard-of form of propulsion 
in the ship. She quizzed her hosts about it and they agreed that it was 
pretty good. 

"But how does it work?" she had demanded excitedly. She was still 
quite excited at the beginning of the trip. 

She found that part of the tape and played it through to herself. 

The Grebulons, which is what they called themselves, were politely 
showing her which buttons they pressed to make the ship go. 

"Yes, but what principle does it work on?" she heard herself 
demand, from behind the camera. 

"Oh, you mean is it something like a warp drive or something like 
that?" they said. 

"Yes," persisted Tricia. "What is it?" 

"It probably is something of the kind," they said. 

"Like what?" 

"Warp drive, photon drive, something like that. You'd have to ask 
the Flight Engineer." 



"Which one is he?" 

"We don't know. We have all lost our minds, you see." 

"Oh yes," said Tricia, a little faintly. "So you said. Um, how did you 
lose your minds, exactly, then?." 

"We don't know," they said, patiently. 

"Because you've lost your minds," echoed Tricia, glumly. 

"Would you like to watch television? It is a long flight. We watch 
television. It is something we enjoy." 

All of this riveting stuff was on the tape, and fine viewing it made. 
First of all the picture quality was extremely poor. Tricia didn't know 
why this was, exactly. She had a feeling that the Grebulons responded 
to a slightly different range of light frequencies, and that there had 
been a lot of ultra-violet around which was mucking up the video 
camera. There were a lot of interference patterns and video snow as 
well. Probably something to do with the warp drive that none of them 
knew the first thing about. 

So what she had on tape, essentially, was a bunch of slightly thin 
and discoloured people sitting around watching televisions that were 
showing network broadcasts. She had also pointed the camera out of 
the very tiny viewport near her seat and got a nice, slightly streaky 
effect of stars. She knew it was real, but it would have taken a good 
three or four minutes to fake. 

In the end she had decided to save her precious videotape for 
Rupert itself and had simply sat back and watched television with 
them. She had even dozed off for a while. 

So part of her sick feeling came from the sense that she had had all 
that time in an alien spacecraft of astounding technological design, 
and had spent most of it dozing in front of reruns of M*A*S*H and 
Cagney and Lacey. But what else was there to do? She had taken 
some photos as well, of course, all of which had subsequently turned 
out to be badly fogged when she got them back from the chemist. 

Another part of her sick feeling probably came from the landing on 
Rupert. This at least had been dramatic and hair-raising. The ship had 
come sweeping in over a dark and sombre landscape, a terrain so 
desperately far removed from the heat and light of its parent sun that 
it seemed like a map of the psychological scars on the mind of an 
abandoned child. 



Lights blazed through the frozen darkness and Guided the ship into 
the mouth of some kind of cave that seemed to bend itself open to 
accept the small craft. 

Unfortunately, because of the angle of their approach, and the 
depth at which the small thick viewport was set into the craft's skin, it 
hadn't been possible to get the video camera to point directly at any 
of it. She ran through that bit of the tape. 

The camera was pointing directly at the sun. 

This is normally very bad for a video camera. But when the sun is 
roughly a third of a billion miles away it doesn't do any harm. In fact it 
hardly makes any impression at all. You just get a small point of light 
right in the middle of the frame, which could be just about anything. 

It was just one star in a multitude. 

Tricia fast-forwarded. 

Ah. Now, the next bit had been quite promising. They had emerged 
out of the ship into a vast, grey, hangar-like structure. This was clearly 
alien technology on a dramatic scale. Huge grey buildings under the 
dark canopy of the Perspex bubble. These were the same buildings 
that she had been looking at the end of the tape. She had taken more 
footage of them while leaving Rupert a few hours later, just as she 
was about to reboard the spacecraft for the journey home. What did 
they remind her of? 

Well, as much as anything else they reminded her of a film set from 
just about any low-budget science-fiction movie of the last twenty 
years. A lot larger, of course, but it all looked thoroughly tawdry and 
unconvincing on the video screen. Apart from the dreadful picture 
quality she had been struggling with the unexpected effects of gravity 
that was appreciably lower than that on Earth, and she had found it 
very hard to keep the camera from bouncing around in an 
embarrassingly unprofessional way. It was therefore impossible to 
make out any detail. 

And now here was the Leader coming forward to greet her, smiling 
and sticking his hand out. 

That was all he was called. The Leader. 

None of the Grebulons had names, largely because they couldn't 
think of any. Tricia discovered that some of them had thought of 
calling themselves after characters from television programmes they 



had picked up from Earth, but hard as they had tried to call each 
other Wayne and Bobby and Chuck, some remnant of something 
lurking deep in the cultural subconscious they had brought with them 
from the distant stars which were their homes must have told them 
that this really wasn't right and wouldn't do. 

The Leader had looked pretty much like all the others. Possibly a bit 
less thin. He said how much he enjoyed her shows on TV, that he was 
her greatest fan, how glad he was that she had been able to come 
along and visit them on Rupert and how much everybody had been 
looking forward to her coming, how he hoped the flight had been 
comfortable and so on. There was no particular sense she could 
detect of being any kind of emissary from the stars or anything. 

Certainly, watching it now on videotape, he just looked like some 
guy in costume and make-up, standing in front of a set that wouldn't 
hold up too well if you leant against it. 

She sat staring at the screen with her face cradled in her hands, 
and shaking her head in slow bewilderment. 

This was awful. 

Not only was this bit awful but she knew what was coming next. It 
was the bit where the Leader asked if she was hungry after the flight, 
and would she perhaps like to come and have something to eat? They 
could discuss things over a little dinner. 

She could remember what she was thinking at this point. 

Alien food. 

How was she going to deal with it? 

Would she actually have to eat it? Would she have access to some 
sort of paper napkin she could spit stuff out into? Wouldn't there be 
all sorts of differential immunity problems? 

It turned out to be hamburgers. 

Not only did it turn out to be hamburgers, but the hamburgers it 
turned out to be were very clearly and obviously McDonald's 
hamburgers which had been reheated in a microwave. It wasn't just 
the look of them. It wasn't just the smell. It was the polystyrene 
clamshell packages they came in which had "McDonald's" printed all 
over them. 



"Eat! Enjoy!" said the Leader. "Nothing is too good for our 
honoured guest!" 

This was in his private apartment. Tricia had looked around it in 
bewilderment that had bordered on fear but had nevertheless got it 
all on videotape. 

The apartment had a waterbed in it. And a Midi hi-fi. And one of 
those tall electrically illuminated glass things which sit on table tops 
and appear to have large globules of sperm floating about in them. 
The walls were covered in velvet. 

The leader lounged against a brown corduroy bean bag and 
squirted breath-freshener into his mouth. 

Tricia began to feel very scared, suddenly. She was further from 
Earth than any human being, to her knowledge, had ever been, and 
she was with an alien creature, who was lounging against a brown 
corduroy bean bag and squirting breath-freshener into his mouth. 

She didn't want to make any false moves. She didn't want to alarm 
him. But there were things she had to know. 

"How did you... where did you get... this?" she asked, gesturing 
around the room, nervously. 

"The decor?" asked the Leader. "Do you like it? It is very 
sophisticated. We are a sophisticated people, we Grebulons. We buy 
sophisticated consumer durables... by mail order." 

Tricia had nodded tremendously slowly at this point. 

"Mail order..." she had said. 

The Leader chuckled. It was one of those dark chocolate reassuring 
silky chuckles. 

"I think you think they ship it here. No! Ha Ha! We have arranged a 
special box number in New Hampshire. We make regular pick-up 
visits. Ha Ha!" He lounged back in a relaxed fashion on his bean bag, 
reached for a reheated french fry and nibbled the end of it, an 
amused smile playing across, his lips. 

Tricia could feel her brain beginning to bubble very slightly. She 
kept the video camera going. 

"How do you, well, er, how do you pay for these 
wonderful...things?" 

The Leader chuckled again. 



"American Express," he said with a nonchalant shrug. 

Tricia nodded slowly again. She knew that they gave cards 
exclusively to just about anybody. 

"And these?" she said, holding up the hamburger he had presented 
her with. 

"It is very easy," said the Leader. "We stand in line." 

Again, Tricia realised with a cold, trickling feeling going down her 
spine, that explained an awful lot. 

She hit the fast forward button again. There was nothing of any use 
here at all. It was all nightmarish madness. She could have faked 
something that would have looked more convincing. 

Another sick feeling began to creep over her as she watched this 
hopeless awful tape, and she began, with slow horror, to realise that 
it must be the answer. 

She must be... 

She shook her head and tried to get a grip. 

An overnight flight going East... The sleeping pills she had taken to 
get her through it. The vodka she'd had to set the sleeping pills going. 

What else? Well. There was seventeen years of obsession that a 
glamorous man with two heads, one of which was disguised as a 
parrot in a cage, had tried to pick her up at a party but had then 
impatiently flown off to another planet in a flying saucer. There 
suddenly seemed to be all sorts of bothersome aspects to that idea 
that had never really occurred to her. Never occurred to her. In 
seventeen years. 

She stuffed her fist into her mouth. 

She must get help. 

Then there had been Eric Bartlett banging on about alien 
spacecraft landing on her lawn. And before that... New York had been, 
well, very hot and stressful. The high hopes and the bitter 
disappointment. The astrology stuff. 

She must have had a nervous breakdown. 

That was it. She was exhausted and she had had a nervous 
breakdown and had started hallucinating some time after she got 
home. She had dreamt the whole story. An alien race of people 



dispossessed of their own lives and histories, stuck on a remote 
outpost of our solar system and filling their cultural vacuum with our 
cultural junk. Ha! It was nature's way of telling her to check into an 
expensive medical establishment very quickly. 

She was very, very sick. She looked at how many large coffees 
she'd got through as well, and realised how heavily she was breathing 
and how fast. 

Part of solving any problem, she told herself, was realising that you 
had it. She started to bring her breathing under control. She had 
caught herself in time. She had seen where she was. She was on the 
way back from whatever psychological precipice she had been on the 
brink of. She started to calm down, to calm down, to calm down. She 
sat back in the chair and closed her eyes. 

After a while, now that she was breathing normally again, she 
opened them again. 

So where had she got this tape from then? 

* * * 

It was still running. 

All right. It was a fake. 

She had faked it herself, that was it. 

It must have been her who had faked it because her voice was all 
over the soundtrack, asking questions. Every now and then the 
camera would swing down at the end of a shot and she would see her 
own feet in her own shoes. She had faked it and she had no 
recollection of faking it or any idea of why she had done it. 

Her breathing was getting hectic again as she watched the snowy, 
flickering screen. 

She must still be hallucinating. 

She shook her head, trying to make it go away. She had no memory 
of faking any of this very obviously fake stuff. On the other hand she 
did seem to have memories that were very like the faked stuff. She 
continued to watch in a bewildered trance. 

The person she imagined to be called the Leader was questioning 
her about astrology and she was answering smoothly and calmly. Only 
she could detect the well-disguised rising panic in her own voice. 



The Leader pushed a button, and a maroon velvet wall slid aside, 
revealing a large bank of flat TV monitors. 

Each of the monitors was showing a kaleidoscope of different 
images: a few seconds from a game show, a few seconds from a cop 
show, a few seconds from a supermarket warehouse security system, 
a few seconds from somebody's holiday movies, a few seconds of sex, 
a few seconds of news, a few seconds of comedy. It was clear that the 
Leader was very proud of all this stuff and he was waving his hands 
like a conductor while continuing at the same time to talk complete 
gibberish. 

Another wave of his hands, and all the screens cleared to form one 
giant computer screen showing in diagrammatic form all the planets 
of the solar system and mapped out against a background of the stars 
in their constellations. The display was completely static. 

"We have great skills," the Leader was saying. "Great skills in 
computation, in cosmological trigonometry, in three-dimensional 
navigational calculus. Great skills. Great, great skills. Only we have lost 
them. It is too bad. We like to have skills only they have gone. They 
are in space somewhere, hurtling. With our names and the details of 
our homes and loved ones. Please," he said, gesturing her forward to 
sit at the computer's console, "be skilful for us." 

Obviously what happened next was that Tricia quickly set the video 
camera up on its tripod to capture the whole scene. She then walked 
into shot herself and sat down calmly in front of the giant computer 
display, spent a few moments familiarising herself with the interface 
and then started smoothly and competently to pretend that she had 
the faintest idea what she was doing. 

It hadn't been that difficult, in fact. 

She was, after all, a mathematician and astrophysicist by training 
and a television presenter by experience, and what science she had 
forgotten over the years she was more than capable of making up by 
bluffing. 

The computer she was working on was clear evidence that the 
Grebulons came from a far more advanced and sophisticated culture 
than their current vacuous state suggested, and with its aid she was 
able, within about half an hour, to cobble together a rough working 
model of the solar system. 



It wasn't particularly accurate or anything, but it looked good. The 
planets were whizzing around in reasonably good simulations of their 
orbits, and you could watch the movement of the whole piece of 
virtual cosmological clockwork from any point within the system - 
very roughly. You could watch from Earth, you could watch from Mars, 
etc. You could watch from the surface of the planet Rupert. Tricia had 
been quite impressed with herself, but also very impressed with the 
computer system she was working on. Using a computer workstation 
on Earth the task would probably have taken a year or so of 
programming. 

When she was finished, the Leader came up behind her and 
watched. He was very pleased and delighted with what she had 
achieved. 

"Good," he said. "And now, please, I would like you to demonstrate 
how to use the system you have just designed to translate the 
information in this book for me." 

Quietly he put a book down in front of her. 

It was You and Your Planets by Gail Andrews. 

Tricia stopped the tape again. 

She was definitely feeling very wobbly indeed. The feeling that she 
was hallucinating had now receded, but had not left anything any 
easier or clearer in her head. 

She pushed her seat back from the editing desk and wondered 
what to do. Years ago she had left the field of astronomical research 
because she knew, without any doubt whatsoever, that she had met a 
being from another planet. At a party. And she had also known, 
without any doubt whatsoever, that she would have made herself a 
laughing stock if she had ever said so. But how could she study 
cosmology and not say anything about the single most important 
thing she knew about it? She had done the only thing she could do. 

She had left. 

Now she worked in television and the same thing had happened 
again. 

She had videotape, actual videotape of the most astounding story 
in the history of, well anything: a forgotten outpost of an alien 



civilisation marooned on the outermost planet of our own solar 
system. 

She had the story. 

She had been there. 

She had seen it. 

She had the videotape for God's sake. 

And if she ever showed it to anybody, she would be a laughing 
stock. 

How could she prove any of this? It wasn't even worth thinking 
about. The whole thing was a nightmare from virtually any angle she 
cared to look at it from. Her head was beginning to throb. 

She had some aspirin in her bag. She went out of the little editing 
suite to the water dispenser down the corridor. She took the aspirin 
and drank several cups of water. 

The place seemed to be very quiet. Usually there were more 
people bustling about the place, or at least some people bustling 
around the place. She popped her head round the door of the editing 
suite next to hers but there was no one there. 

She had gone rather overboard keeping people out of her own 
suite. "DO NOT DISTURB," the notice read. "DO NOT EVEN THINK OF 
ENTERING. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. GO AWAY. I'M BUSY!" 

When she went back in she noticed that the message light on her 
phone extension was winking, and wondered how long it had been on. 

"Hello?" she said to the receptionist. 

"Oh, Miss McMillan, I'm so glad you called. Everybody's been trying 
to reach you. Your TV company. They're desperate to reach you. Can 
you call them?" 

"Why didn't you put them through?" said Tricia. 

"You said I wasn't to put anybody through for anything. You said I 
was to deny that you were even here. I didn't know what to do. I 
came up to give you a message, but..." 

"OK," said Tricia, cursing herself. She phoned her office. 

"Tricia! Where the haemorrhaging fuck are you?" 

"At the editing..." 

"They said..." 



"I know. What's up?" 

"What's up? Only a bloody alien spaceship!" 

"What? Where?" 

"Regent's Park. Big silver job. Some girl with a bird. She speaks 
English and throws rocks at people and wants someone to repair her 
watch. Just get there." 

Tricia stared at it. 

It wasn't a Grebulon ship. Not that she was suddenly an expert on 
extraterrestrial craft, but this was a sleek and beautiful silver and 
white thing about the size of a large ocean - going yacht, which is 
what it most resembled. Next to this, the structures of the huge half- 
dismantled Grebulon ship looked like gun turrets on a battleship. Gun 
turrets. That's what those blank grey buildings had looked like. And 
what was odd about them was that by the time she passed them 
again on her way to reboarding the small Grebulon craft, they had 
moved. These things flitted briefly through her head as she ran from 
the taxi to meet her camera crew. 

"Where's the girl?" she shouted above the noise of helicopters and 
police sirens. 

"There!" shouted the producer while the sound engineer hurried to 
clip a radio mike to her. "She says her mother and father came from 
here in some parallel dimension or something like that, and she's got 
her father's watch, and... I don't know. What can I tell you? Busk it. 
Ask her what it feels like to be from outer space." 

"Thanks a lot, Ted," muttered Tricia, checked that her mike was 
securely clipped, gave the engineer some level, took a deep breath, 
tossed her hair back and switched into her role of professional 
reporter, on home ground, ready for anything. 

At least, nearly anything. 

She turned to look for the girl. That must be her, with the wild hair 
and wild eyes. The girl turned towards her. And stared. 

"Mother!" she screamed, and started to hurl rocks at Tricia. 



Chapter 22 


Daylight exploded around them. Hot, heavy sun. A desert plain 
stretched out ahead in a haze of heat. They thundered out into it. 

"Jump!" shouted Ford Prefect. 

"What?" shouted Arthur Dent, holding on for dear life. 

There was no reply. 

"What did you say?" shouted Arthur again, and then realised that 
Ford Prefect was no longer there. He looked around in panic and 
started to slip. Realising he couldn't hold on any longer he pushed 
himself sideways as hard as he could and rolled into a ball as he hit 
the ground, rolling, rolling away from the pounding hooves. 

What a day, he thought, as he started furiously coughing dust up 
out of his lungs. He hadn't had a day as bad as this since the Earth had 
been blown up. He staggered up to his knees, and then up to his feet 
and started to run away. He didn't know what from or what to, but 
running away seemed a prudent move. 

He ran straight into Ford Prefect who was standing there surveying 
the scene. 

"Look," said Ford. "That is precisely what we need." 

Arthur coughed up some more dust, and wiped some other dust 
out of his hair and eyes. He turned, panting, to look at what Ford was 
looking at. 

It didn't look much like the domain of a King, or the King, or any 
kind of King. It looked quite inviting though. 

First, the context. This was a desert world. The dusty earth was 
packed hard and had neatly bruised every last bit of Arthur that 
hadn't already been bruised by the festivities of the previous night. 
Some way ahead of them were great cliffs that looked like sandstone, 
eroded by the wind and what little rain presumably fell in those parts 
into wild and fantastic shapes, which matched the fantastic shapes of 
the giant cacti that sprouted here and there from the arid, orange 
landscape. 



For a moment Arthur dared to hope they had unexpectedly arrived 
in Arizona or New Mexico or maybe South Dakota, but there was 
plenty of evidence that this was not the case. 

The Perfectly Normal Beasts, for a start, still thundering, still 
pounding. They swept up in their tens of thousands from the far 
horizon, disappeared completely for about half a mile, then swept off, 
thundering and pounding to the distant horizon opposite. 

Then there were the spaceships parked in front of the Bar & Grill. 
Ah. The Domain of the King Bar & Grill. Bit of an anti-climax, thought 
Arthur to himself. 

In fact only one of the spaceships was parked in front of the 
Domain of the King Bar & Grill. The other three were in a parking lot 
by the side of the Bar and Grill. It was the one in front that caught the 
eye, though. Wonderful looking thing. Wild fins all over it, far, far too 
much chrome all over the fins and most of the actual bodywork 
painted in a shocking pink. It crouched there like an immense 
brooding insect and looked as if it was at any moment about to jump 
on something about a mile away. 

The Domain of the King Bar & Grill was slap bang in the middle of 
where the Perfectly Normal Beasts would be charging if they didn't 
take a minor transdimensional diversion on the way. It stood on its 
own, undisturbed. An ordinary Bar & Grill. A truckstop diner. 
Somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Quiet. The Domain of the King. 

"Gonna buy that spaceship," said Ford quietly. 

"Buy it?" said Arthur. "That's not like you. I thought you usually 
pinched them." 

"Sometimes you have to show a little respect," said Ford. 

"Probably have to show a little cash as well," said Arthur. "Flow the 
hell much is that thing worth?" 

With a tiny movement. Ford brought his Dine-O-Charge credit card 
up out of his pocket. Arthur noticed that the hand holding it was 
trembling very slightly. 

"I'll teach them to make me the restaurant critic..." breathed Ford. 

"What do you mean?" asked Arthur. 

"I'll show you," said Ford with a nasty glint in his eye. 

"Let's go and run up a few expenses shall we?" 



"Couple beers," said Ford, "and, I dunno, a couple bacon rolls, 
whatever you got, oh and that pink thing outside." 

He flipped his card on the top of the bar and looked around 
casually. 

There was a kind of silence. 

There hadn't been a lot of noise before, but there was definitely a 
kind of silence now. Even the distant thunder of the Perfectly Normal 
Beasts carefully avoiding the Domain of the King seemed suddenly a 
little muted. 

"Just rode into town," said Ford as if nothing was odd about that or 
about anything else. He was leaning against the bar at an 
extravagantly relaxed angle. 

There were about three other customers in the place, sitting at 
tables, nursing beers. About three. Some people would say there 
were exactly three, but it wasn't that kind of a place, not the kind of a 
place that you felt like being that specific in. There was some big guy 
setting up some stuff on the little stage as well. Old drum kit. Couple 
guitars. Country and Western kind of stuff. 

The barman was not moving very swiftly to get in Ford's order. In 
fact he wasn't moving at all. 

"Not sure that the pink thing's for sale," he said at last in the kind 
of accent that went on for quite a long time. 

"Sure it is," said Ford. "How much you want?" 

"Well..." 

"Think of a number. I'll double it." 

"T'ain't mine to sell," said the barman. 

"So, whose?" 

The barman nodded at the big guy setting up on the stage. Big fat 
guy, moving slow, balding. 

Ford nodded. He grinned. 

"OK," he said. "Get the beers, get the rolls. Keep the tab open." 

Arthur sat at the bar and rested. He was used to not knowing what 
was going on. He felt comfortable with it. The beer was pretty good 
and made him a little sleepy which he didn't mind at all. The bacon 
rolls were not bacon rolls. They were Perfectly Normal Beast rolls. He 



exchanged a few professional roll-making remarks with the barman 
and just let Ford get on with whatever Ford wanted to do. 

"OK," said Ford, returning to his stool. "It's cool. We got the pink 
thing." 

The barman was very surprised. "Fle's selling it to you?" 

"Fle's giving it to us for free," said Ford, taking a gnaw at his roll. 
"Fley, no, keep the tab open though. We have some items to add to it. 
Good roll." 

He took a deep pull of beer. 

"Good beer," he added. "Good ship too," he said, eying the big pink 
and chrome insect-like thing, bits of which could be seen through the 
windows of the bar. "Good everything, pretty much. You know, he 
said, sitting back, reflectively, "it's at times like this that you kind of 
wonder if it's worth worrying about the fabric of space/time and the 
causal integrity of the multi-dimensional probability matrix and the 
potential collapse of all wave forms in the Whole Sort of General Mish 
Mash and all that sort of stuff that's been bugging me. Maybe I feel 
that what the big guy says is right. Just let it all go. What does it 
matter? Let it go." 

"Which big guy?" said Arthur. 

Ford just nodded towards the stage. The big guy was saying "one 
two" into the mike a couple of times. Couple other guys were on the 
stage now. Drums. Guitar. 

The barman, who had been silent for a moment or two, said, "You 
say he's letting you have his ship?" 

"Yeah," said Ford. "Let it all go is what he said. Take the ship. Take 
it with my blessing. Be good to her. I will he good to her." 

He took a pull at his beer again. 

"Like I was saying," he went on. "It's at times like this that you kind 
of think, let it all go. But then you think of guys like InfiniDim 
Enterprises and you think, they are not going to get away with it. They 
are going to suffer. It is my sacred and holy duty to see those guys 
suffer. Here, let me put something on the tab for the singer. I asked 
for a special request and we agreed. It's to go on the tab. OK?" 

"OK," said the barman, cautiously. Then he shrugged. "OK, 
however you want to do it. How much?" 



Ford named a figure. The barman fell over amongst the bottles and 
glasses. Ford vaulted quickly over the bar to check that he was all 
right and help him back up to his feet. He'd cut his finger and his 
elbow a bit and was feeling a little woozy but was otherwise fine. The 
big guy started to sing. The barman hobbled off with Ford's credit 
card to get authorisation. 

"Is there stuff going on here that I don't know about?" said Arthur 
to Ford. 

"Isn't there usually?" said Ford. 

"No need to be like that," said Arthur. Fie began to wake up. 
"Shouldn't we be going?" he said suddenly. "Will that ship get us to 
Earth?" 

"Sure will," said Ford. 

"That's where Random will be going!" said Arthur with a start. "We 
can follow her! But... er..." 

Ford let Arthur get on with thinking things out for himself while he 
got out his old edition of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 

"But where are we on the probability axis thing?" said Arthur. "Will 
the Earth be there or not there? I spent so much time looking for it. 

All I found was planets that were a bit like it or not at all like it, though 
it was clearly the right place because of the continents. The worst 
version was called NowWhat where I got bitten by some wretched 
little animal. That's how they communicated, you know, by biting 
each other. Bloody painful. Then half the time, of course, the Earth 
isn't even there because it's been blown up by the bloody Vogons. 
Flow much sense am I making?" 

Ford didn't comment. Fie was listening to something. Fie passed 
the Guide over to Arthur and pointed at the screen. The active entry 
read "Earth. Mostly harmless." 

"You mean it's there!" said Arthur excitedly. "The Earth is there! 
That's where Random will be going! The bird was showing her the 
Earth in the rainstorm!" 

Ford motioned Arthur to shout a little less loudly. Fie was listening. 

Arthur was growing impatient. He'd heard bar singers sing "Love 
Me Tender" before. Fie was a bit surprised to hear it here, right in the 
middle of wherever the hell this was, certainly not Earth, but then 
things tended not to surprise him these days as much as formerly. The 



singer was quite good, as bar singers went, if you liked that sort of 
thing, but Arthur was getting fretful. 

He glanced at his watch. This only served to remind him that he 
didn't have his watch any more. Random had it, or at least the 
remains of it. 

"Don't you think we should be going?" he said, insistently. 

"Shhh!" said Ford. "I paid to hear this song." He seemed to have 
tears in his eyes, which Arthur found a bit disturbing. He'd never seen 
Ford moved by anything other than very, very strong drink. Probably 
the dust. He waited, tapping his fingers irritably, out of time with the 
music. 

The song ended. The singer went on to do "Heartbreak Hotel". 

"Anyway," Ford whispered, "I've got to review the restaurant." 

"What?" 

"I have to write a review." 

"Write a review? Of this place?" 

"Filing the review validates the expenses claim. I've fixed it so that 
it happens completely automatically and untraceably. This bill is going 
to need some validation," he added quietly, staring into his beer with 
a nasty smirk. 

"For a couple of beers and a roll?" 

"And a tip for the singer." 

"Why, how much did you tip him?" 

Ford named a figure again. 

"I don't know how much that is," said Arthur. "What's it worth in 
pounds sterling? What would it buy you?" 

"It would probably buy you, roughly... er..." Ford screwed his eyes 
up as he did some calculations in his head. "Switzerland," he said at 
last. He picked up his Hitchhiker's Guide and started to type. 

Arthur nodded intelligently. There were times when he wished he 
understood what on earth Ford was talking about, and other times, 
like now, when he felt it was probably safer not even to try. He looked 
over Ford's shoulder. "This isn't going to take long, is it?" he said. 

"Nah," said Ford. "Piece of piss. Just mention that the rolls were 
quite good, the beer good and cold, local wildlife nicely eccentric, the 



bar singer the best in the known universe, and that's about it. Doesn't 
need much. Just a validation." 

He touched an area on the screen marked ENTER and the message 
vanished into the Sub-Etha. 

"You thought the singer was pretty good then?" 

"Yeah," said Ford. The barman was returning with a piece of paper, 
which seemed to be trembling in his hand. 

He pushed it over to Ford with a kind of nervous, reverential twitch. 

"Funny thing," said the barman. "The system rejected it first couple 
times. Can't say it surprised me." Beads of sweat were standing on his 
brow. "Then suddenly it's, oh yeah, that's OK, and the system... er, 
validates it. Just like that. You wanna...sign it?" 

Ford scanned the form quickly. He sucked his teeth. "This is going 
to hurt InfiniDim a lot," he said, with an appearance of concern. "Oh 
well," he added softly, "screw 'em." 

He signed with a flourish and handed it back to the barman. 

"More money," he said, "than the Colonel made for him in an 
entire career of doing crap movies and casino gigs. Just for doing what 
he does best. Standing up and singing in a bar. And he negotiated it 
himself. I think this is a good moment for him. Tell him I said thanks 
and buy him a drink." He tossed a few coins on the bar. The barman 
pushed them away. 

"I don't think that's necessary," he said, slightly hoarsely. 

"Tis to me," said Ford. "OK, we are outa here." 

They stood out in the heat and the dust and looked at the big pink 
and chrome thing with amazement and admiration. Or at least. Ford 
looked at it with amazement and admiration. 

Arthur just looked at it. "You don't think it's a bit overdone, do 
you?" 

He said it again when they climbed inside it. The seats and quite a 
lot of the controls were covered in fine fur skin or suede. There was a 
big gold monogram on the main control panel which just read "EP". 

"You know," said Ford as he fired up the ship's engines, "I asked 
him if it was true that he had been abducted by aliens, and you know 
what he said?" 



"Who?" said Arthur. 

"The King." 

"Which King? Oh, we've had this conversation, haven't we?" 

"Never mind," said Ford. "For what it's worth, he said, no. Fie went 
of his own accord." 

"I'm still not sure who we're talking about," said Arthur. Ford shook 
his head. "Look," he said, "there are some tapes over in the 
compartment to your left. Why don't you choose some music and put 
it on?" 

"OK," said Arthur, and flipped through the cartons. "Do you like 
Elvis Presley?" he said. 

"Yeah I do as a matter of fact," said Ford. "Now. I hope this 
machine can leap like it looks like it can." Fie engaged the main drive. 

"Yeeehaah!" shouted Ford as they shot upwards at face-tearing 
speed. 

It could. 



Chapter 23 


The news networks don't like this kind of thing. They regard it as a 
waste. An incontrovertible spaceship arrives out of nowhere in the 
middle of London and it is sensational news of the highest magnitude. 
Another completely different one arrives three and a half hours later 
and somehow it isn't. 

"ANOTHER SPACECRAFT!" said the headlines and news stand 
billboards. "THIS ONE'S PINK." A couple of months later they could 
have made a lot more of it. The third spacecraft, half an hour after 
that, the little four berth Hrundi runabout, only made it on to the 
local news. 

Ford and Arthur had come screaming down out of the stratosphere 
and parked neatly on Portland Place. It was just after six-thirty in the 
evening and there were spaces free. They mingled briefly with the 
crowd that gathered round to ogle, then said loudly that if no one else 
was going to call the police they would, and made good their escape. 

"Home..." said Arthur, a husky tone creeping into his voice as he 
gazed, misty-eyed around him. 

"Oh don't get all maudlin on me," snapped Ford. "We have to find 
your daughter and we have to find that bird thing." 

"How?" said Arthur. "This is a planet of five and a half billion 
people, and..." 

"Yes," said Ford. "But only one of them has just arrived from outer 
space in a large silver spaceship accompanied by a mechanical bird. I 
suggest we just find a television and something to drink while we 
watch it. We need some serious room service." They checked into a 
large two-bedroomed suite at the Langham. Mysteriously, Ford's 
Dine-O-Charge card, issued on a planet over five thousand light years 
away, seemed to present the hotel's computer with no problems. 

Ford hit the phones straight away while Arthur attempted to locate 
the television. 



"OK," said Ford. "I want to order up some margaritas please. 

Couple of pitchers. Couple of Chefs Salads. And as much foie gras as 
you've got. And also London Zoo." 

"She's on the news!" shouted Arthur from the next room. 

"That's what I said," said Ford into the phone. "London Zoo. Just 
charge it to the room." 

"She's... Good God!" shouted Arthur. "Do you know who she's 
being interviewed by?" 

"Are you having difficulty understanding the English language?" 
continued Ford. "It's the zoo just up the road from here. I don't care if 
it's closed this evening. I don't want to buy a ticket, I just want to buy 
the zoo. I don't care if you're busy. This is room service, I'm in a room 
and I want some service. Got a piece of paper? OK. Flere's what I want 
you to do. All the animals that can be safely returned to the wild, 
return them. Set up some good teams of people to monitor their 
progress in the wild, see that they're doing OK." 

"It's Trillian!" shouted Arthur. "Or is it... er... God, I can't stand all 
this parallel universe stuff. It's so bloody confusing. It seems to be a 
different Trillian. It's Tricia McMillan which is what Trillian used to be 
called before... er... Why don't you come and watch, see if you can 
figure it out?" 

"Just a second," Ford shouted, and returned to his negotiations 
with room service. "Then we'll need some natural reserves for the 
animals that can't hack it in the wild," he said. "Set up a team to work 
out the best places to do that. We might need to buy somewhere like 
Zaire and maybe some islands. Madagascar. Baffin. Sumatra. Those 
kind of places. We'll need a wide variety of habitats. Look, I don't see 
why you're seeing this as a problem. Learn to delegate. Hire whoever 
you want. Get on to it. I think you'll find my credit is good. And blue 
cheese dressing on the salad. Thank you." 

He put the phone down and went through to Arthur, who was 
sitting on the edge of his bed watching television. 

"I ordered us some foie gras," said Ford. 

"What?" said Arthur, whose attention was entirely focused on the 
television. 

"I said I ordered us some foie gras." 



"Oh," said Arthur, vaguely. "Um, I always feel a hit bad about foie 
gras. Bit cruel to the geese, isn't it?" 

"Fuck 'em," said Ford, slumping on the bed. "You can't care about 
every damn thing." 

"Well, that's all very well for you to say, but..." 

"Drop it!" said Ford. "If you don't like it I'll have yours. What's 
happening?" 

"Chaos!" said Arthur. "Complete chaos! Random keeps on 
screaming at Trillian, or Tricia or whoever it is, that she abandoned 
her and then demanding to go to a good night club. Tricia's broken 
down in tears and says she's never even met Random let alone given 
birth to her. Then she suddenly started howling about someone called 
Rupert and said that he had lost his mind or something. I didn't quite 
follow that bit, to be honest. Then Random started throwing stuff and 
they've cut to a commercial break while they try and sort it all out. Oh 
They've just cut back to the studio! Shut up and watch." 

A rather shaken anchorman appeared on the screen and 
apologised to viewers for the disruption of the previous item. Fie said 
he didn't have any very clear news to report, only that the mysterious 
girl, who called herself Random Frequent Flyer Dent had left the 
studio to, er, rest. Tricia McMillan would be, he hoped, back 
tomorrow. Meanwhile, fresh reports of UFO activity were coming in... 

Ford leaped up off the bed, grabbed the nearest phone and jabbed 
at a number. 

"Concierge? You want to own the hotel? It's yours if you can find 
out for me in five minutes which clubs Tricia McMillan belongs to. Just 
charge the whole thing to this room." 



Chapter 24 


Away in the inky depths of space invisible movements were being 
made. 

Invisible to any of the inhabitants of the strange and 
temperamental Plural zone at the focus of which lay the infinitely 
multitudinous possibilities of the planet called Earth, but not 
inconsequential to them. 

At the very edge of the solar system, hunkered down on a green 
leatherette sofa, staring fretfully at a range of TV and computer 
screens sat a very worried Grebulon leader. He was fiddling with stuff. 
Fiddling with his book on astrology. Fiddling with the console of his 
computer. Fiddling with the displays being fed through to him 
constantly from all of the Grebulons monitoring devices, all of them 
focused on the planet Earth. 

He was distressed. Their mission was to monitor. But to monitor 
secretly. He was a bit fed up with his mission, to be honest. He was 
fairly certain that his mission must have been to do more than sit 
around watching TV for years on end. They certainly had a lot of other 
equipment with them that must have had some purpose if only they 
hadn't accidentally lost all trace of their purpose. He needed a sense 
of purpose in life, which was why he had turned to astrology to fill the 
yawning gulf that existed in the middle of his mind and soul. That 
would tell him something, surely. 

Well, it was telling him something. 

It was telling him, as far as he could make out, that he was about to 
have a very bad month, that things were going to go from bad to 
worse if he didn't get a grip on things and start making some positive 
moves and thinking things out for himself. 

It was true. It was very clear from his star chart which he had 
worked out using his astrology book and the computer program 
which that nice Tricia McMillan had designed for him to re-triangulate 
all the appropriate astronomical data. Earth-based astrology had to 



be entirely recalculated to yield results that were meaningful to the 
Grebulons here on the tenth planet out on the frozen edges of the 
solar system. 

The recalculations showed absolutely clearly and unambiguously 
that he was going to have a very bad month indeed, starting with 
today. Because today Earth was starting to rise into Capricorn, and 
that, for the Grebulon leader, who showed all the character signs of 
being a classic Taurus, was very bad indeed. 

Now was the time, his horoscope said, for taking positive actions, 
making tough decisions, seeing what needed to be done and doing it. 
This was all very difficult for him, but he knew that nobody ever said 
that doing tough stuff wasn't tough. The computer was already 
tracking and predicting the second-by-second location of the planet 
Earth. He ordered the great grey turrets to swivel. 

Because all of the Grebulon surveillance equipment was focused on 
the planet Earth, it failed to spot that there was now another source 
of data in the solar system. 

Its chances of spotting this other source of data - a massive yellow 
constructor ship - accidentally were practically nil. It was as far from 
the sun as Rupert was, but almost diametrically opposite, almost 
hidden by the sun. 

Almost. 

The massive yellow constructor ship wanted to be able to monitor 
events on Planet Ten without being spotted itself. It had managed this 
very successfully. 

There were all sorts of other ways in which this ship was 
diametrically opposite to the Grebulons. 

Its leader, its Captain, had a very clear idea of what his purpose was. 
It was a very simple and plain one and he had been pursuing it in his 
simple, plain way for a considerable period of time now. 

Anyone who knew of his purpose might have said that it was a 
pointless and ugly one, that it wasn't the sort of purpose that 
enhanced a life, put a spring in a person's step, made birds sing and 
flowers bloom. Rather the reverse in fact. Absolutely the reverse. 

It wasn't his job to worry about that, though. It was his job to do 
his job, which was to do his job. If that led to a certain narrowness of 



vision and circularity of thought then it wasn't his job to worry about 
such things. Any such things that came his way were referred to 
others who had, in turn, other people to refer such things to. 

Many, many light years from here, indeed from anywhere, lies the 
grim and long abandoned planet, Vogsphere. Somewhere on a fetid, 
fog-bound mud bank on this planet there stands, surrounded by the 
dirty, broken and empty carapaces of the last few jeweled scuttling 
crabs, a small stone monument which marks the place, where it is 
thought, the species Vogon Vogonblurtus first arose. On the 
monument there is carved an arrow which points away into the fog, 
under which are inscribed in plain, simple letters the words "The buck 
stops there." 

Deep in the bowels of his unsightly yellow ship, the Vogon Captain 
grunted as he reached for a slightly faded and dog-eared piece of 
paper that lay in front of him. A demolition order. 

If you were to unravel exactly where the Captain's job, which was 
to do his job which was to do his job, actually began, then it all came 
down at last to this piece of paper that had been issued to him by his 
immediate superior long ago. The piece of paper had an instruction 
on it, and his purpose was to carry out that instruction and put a little 
tick mark in the adjacent box when he had carried it out. 

He had carried out the instruction once before, but a number of 
troublesome circumstances had prevented him from being able to put 
the tick in the little box. 

One of the troublesome circumstances was the Plural nature of this 
Galactic sector, where the possible continually interfered with the 
probable. Simple demolition didn't get you any further than pushing 
down a bubble under a badly hung strip of wallpaper. Anything you 
demolished kept on popping up again. That would soon be taken care 
of. 

Another was a small bunch of people who continually refused to be 
where they were supposed to be when they were supposed to be 
there. That, also, would soon be taken care of. 

The third was an irritating and anarchic little device called the 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. That was now well and truly taken 
care of and, in fact, through the phenomenal power of temporal 
reverse engineering, it was now itself the agency through which 
everything else would be taken care of. The Captain had merely come 



to watch the final act of this drama. He himself did not have to lift a 
finger. 

"Show me," he said. 

The shadowy shape of a bird spread its wings and rose into the air 
near him. Darkness engulfed the bridge. Dim lights danced briefly in 
the black eyes of the bird as, deep in its instructional address space, 
bracket after bracket was finally closing, if clauses were finally ending, 
repeat loops halting, recursive functions calling themselves for the 
last few times. 

A brilliant vision lit up in the darkness, a watery blue and green 
vision, a tube flowing through the air, shaped like a chopped up string 
of sausages. 

With a flatulent noise of satisfaction, the Vogon Captain sat back to 
watch. 



Chapter 25 


"Just there, number forty-two," shouted Ford Prefect to the taxi- 
driver. "Right here!" 

The taxi lurched to a halt, and Ford and Arthur jumped out. They 
had stopped at quite a number of cash-dispensers on the way, and 
Ford chucked a fistful of money through the window at the driver. 

The entrance to the club was dark, smart and severe. Only the 
smallest little plaque bore its name. Members knew where it was, and 
if you weren't a member then knowing where it was wasn't any help 
to you. 

Ford Prefect was not a member of Stavro's though he had once 
been to Stavro's other club in New York. Fie had a very simple method 
of dealing with establishments of which he was not a member. Fie 
simply swept in as soon as the door was opened, pointed back at 
Arthur and said, "It's OK, he's with me." 

Fie bounded down the dark glossy stairs, feeling very froody in his 
new shoes. They were suede and they were blue, and he was very 
pleased that in spite of everything else going on he had been sharp- 
eyed enough to spot them in a shop window from the back of a 
speeding taxi. 

"I thought I told you not to come here." 

"What?" said Ford. 

A thin, ill-looking man wearing something baggy and Italian was 
walking up the stairs past them, lighting a cigarette, and had stopped, 
suddenly. 

"Not you," he said. "Him." 

He looked straight at Arthur, then seemed to become a little 
confused. 

"Excuse me," he said. "I think I must have mistaken you for 
someone else." He started on up the stairs again, but almost 
immediately turned round once more, even more puzzled. He stared 
at Arthur. 



"Now what?" said Ford. 

"What did you say?" 

"I said, now what?" repeated Ford irritably. 

"Yes, I think so," said the man and swayed slightly and dropped the 
book of matches he'd been carrying. His mouth moved weakly. Then 
he put his hand to his forehead. 

"Excuse me," he said, "I'm trying desperately to remember which 
drug I've just taken, but it must be one of those ones which mean you 
can't remember." 

Fie shook his head and turned away again, and went up towards 
the men's room. 

"Come on," said Ford. Fie hurried on downstairs, with Arthur 
following nervously in his wake. The encounter had shaken him badly 
and he didn't know why. 

Fie didn't like places like this. For all of the dreams of Earth and 
home he had had for years, he now badly missed his hut on Lamuella 
with his knives and his sandwiches. Fie even missed Old Thrashbarg. 

"Arthur!" 

It was the most astounding effect. His name was being shouted in 
stereo. 

He twisted to look one way. Up the stairs behind him he saw 
Trillian hurrying down towards him in her wonderfully rumpled 
RymplonTM. She was looking suddenly aghast. 

He twisted the other way to see what she was looking suddenly 
aghast at. 

At the bottom of the stairs was Trillian, wearing... No - this was 
Tricia. Tricia that he had just seen, hysterical with confusion, on 
television. And behind her was Random, looking more wild-eyed than 
ever. Behind her in the recesses of the smart, dimly lit club, the other 
clientele of the evening formed a frozen tableau, staring anxiously up 
at the confrontation on the stairs. 

For a few seconds everyone stood stock still. Only the music from 
behind the bar didn't know to stop throbbing. 

"The gun she is holding," said Ford quietly, nodding slightly towards 
Random, "is a Wabanatta 3. It was in the ship she stole from me. It's 
quite dangerous in fact. Just don't move for a moment. Let's just 
everybody stay calm and find out what's upsetting her." 



"Where do I fit?" screamed Random suddenly. The hand holding 
the gun was trembling fiercely. Her other hand delved into her pocket 
and pulled out the remains of Arthur's watch. She shook it at them. 

"I thought I would fit here," she cried, "on the world that made me! 
But it turns out that even my mother doesn't know who I am!" She 
flung the watch violently aside, and it smashed into the glasses 
behind the bar, scattering its innards. 

Everyone was very quiet for a moment or two longer. 

"Random," said Trillian quietly from up on the stairs. 

"Shut up!" shouted Random. "You abandoned me!" 

"Random, it is very important that you listen to me and 
understand," persisted Trillian quietly. "There isn't very much time. 

We must leave. We must all leave." 

"What are you talking about? We're always leaving!" She had both 
hands on the gun now, and both were shaking. There was no one in 
particular she was pointing it at. She was just pointing it at the world 
in general. 

"Listen," said Trillian again. "I left you because I went to cover a 
war for the network. It was extremely dangerous. At least, I thought it 
was going to be. I arrived and the war had suddenly ceased to happen. 
There was a time anomaly and... listen! Please listen! A 
reconnaissance battleship had failed to turn up, the rest of the fleet 
was scattered in some farcical disarray. It's happening all the time 
now." 

"I don't care! I don't want to hear about your bloody job!" shouted 
Random. "I want a home! I want to fit somewhere!" 

"This is not your home," said Trillian, still keeping her voice calm. 
"You don't have one. We none of us have one. Hardly anybody has 
one any more. The missing ship I was just talking about. The people of 
that ship don't have a home. They don't know where they are from. 
They don't even have any memory of who they are or what they are 
for. They are very lost and very confused and very frightened. They 
are here in this solar system, and they are about to do something 
very... misGuided because they are so lost and confused. We... must... 
leave... now. I can't tell you where there is to go to. Perhaps there 
isn't anywhere. But here is not the place to be. Please. One more time. 
Can we go?" 



Random was wavering in panic and confusion. 

"It's all right," said Arthur gently. "If I'm here, we're safe. Don't ask 
me to explain just now, but I am safe, so you are safe. OK?" 

"What are you saying?" said Trillian. 

"Let's all just relax," said Arthur. He was feeling very tranquil. His 
life was charmed and none of this seemed real. 

Slowly, gradually, Random began to relax, and to let the gun down, 
inch by inch. 

Two things happened simultaneously. 

The door to the men's room at the top of the stairs opened, and 
the man who had accosted Arthur came out, sniffing. 

Startled at the sudden movement, Random lifted the gun again just 
as a man standing behind her made a grab for it. 

Arthur threw himself forward. There was a deafening explosion. He 
fell awkwardly as Trillian threw herself down over him. The noise died 
away. Arthur looked up to see the man at the top of the stairs gazing 
down at him with a look of utter stupefaction. 

"You..." he said. Then slowly, horribly, he fell apart. 

Random threw the gun down and fell to her knees, sobbing. "I'm 
sorry!" she said. "I'm so sorry! I'm so, so sorry..." 

Tricia went to her. Trillian went to her. 

Arthur sat on the stairs with his head between his hands and had 
not the faintest idea what to do. Ford was sitting on the stair beneath 
him. He picked something up, looked at it with interest, and passed it 
up to Arthur. 

"This mean anything to you? he said. 

Arthur took it. It was the book of matches which the dead man had 
dropped. It had the name of the club on it. It had the name of the 
proprietor of the club on it. It looked like this: 

STAVRO MUELLER 

BETA 


He stared at it for some time as things began slowly to reassemble 
themselves in his mind. He wondered what he should do, but he only 
wondered it idly. Around him people were beginning to rush and 
shout a lot, but it was suddenly very clear to him that there was 



nothing to be done, not now or ever. Through the new strangeness of 
noise and light he could just make out the shape of Ford Prefect 
sitting back and laughing wildly. 

A tremendous feeling of peace came over him. He knew that at last, 
for once and for ever, it was now all, finally, over. 

In the darkness of the bridge at the heart of the Vogon ship, 
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz sat alone. Lights flared briefly across the 
external vision screens that lined one wall. In the air above him the 
discontinuities in the blue and green watery sausage shape resolved 
themselves. Options collapsed, possibilities folded into each other, 
and the whole at last resolved itself out of existence. 

A very deep darkness descended. The Vogon captain sat immersed 
in it for a few seconds. 

"Light" he said. 

There was no response. The bird, too, had crumpled out of all 
possibility. 

The Vogon turned on the light himself. He picked up the piece of 
paper again and placed a little tick in the little box. 

Well, that was done. His ship slunk off into the inky void. 

In spite of having taken what he regarded as an extremely positive 
piece of action, the Grebulon Leader ended up having a very bad 
month after all. It was pretty much the same as all the previous 
months except that there was now nothing on the television any 
more. He put on a little light music instead.

1 President: full title President of the Imperial Galactic Government. 

The term Imperial is kept though it is now an anachronism. The 
hereditary Emperor is nearly dead and has been so for many centuries. 
In the last moments of his dying coma he was locked in a statis field 
which keeps him in a state of perpetual unchangingness. All his heirs 
are now long dead, and this means that without any drastic political 
upheaval, power has simply and effectively moved a rung or two 
down the ladder, and is now seen to be vested in a body which used 
to act simply as advisers to the Emperor - an elected Governmental 
assembly headed by a President elected by that assembly. In fact it 
vests in no such place. 

The President in particular is very much a figurehead - he wields no 
real power whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, 
but the qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership 
but those of finely judged outrage. For this reason the President is 
always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating 
character. His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away 
from it. On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most 
successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had - he has already spent 
two of his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud. Very very few 
people realize that the President and the Government have virtually 



no power at all, and of these very few people only six know whence 
ultimate political power is wielded. Most of the others secretly 
believe that the ultimate decision-making process is handled by a 
computer. They couldn't be more wrong. 

2 Ford Prefect's original name is only pronuncible in an obscure 
Betelgeusian dialect, now virtually extinct since the Great Collapsing 
Hrung Disaster of Gal./Sid./Year 03758 which wiped out all the old 
Praxibetel communities on Betelgeuse Seven. Ford's father was the 
only man on the entire planet to survive the Great Collapsing FI rung 
disaster, by an extraordinary coincidence that he was never able 
satisfactorily to explain. The whole episode is shrouded in deep 
mystery: in fact no one ever knew what a Flrung was nor why it had 
chosen to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven particularly. Ford's father, 
magnanimously waving aside the clouds of suspicion that had 
inevitably settled around him, came to live on Betelgeuse Five where 
he both fathered and uncled Ford; in memory of his now dead race he 
christened him in the ancient Praxibetel tongue. 

Because Ford never learned to say his original name, his father 
eventually died of shame, which is still a terminal disease in some 
parts of the Galaxy. The other kids at school nicknamed him lx, which 
in the language of Betelgeuse Five translates as "boy who is not able 
satisfactorily to explain what a Flrung is, nor why it should choose to 
collapse on Betelgeuse Seven".

### DUNE ###

A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.
-from "Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul.
    It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather.
    The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed.
    By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow -- hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded 'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels.
    "Is he not small for his age, Jessica?" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset.
    Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: "The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence." 
    "So I've heard, so I've heard," wheezed the old woman. "Yet he's already fifteen." 
    "Yes, Your Reverence."
    "He's awake and listening to us," said the old woman. "Sly little rascal." She chuckled. "But royalty has need of slyness. And if he's really the Kwisatz Haderach . . . well . . ." 
    Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals -- the eyes of the old woman -- seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his.
    "Sleep well, you sly little rascal," said the old woman. "Tomorrow you'll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar." 
    And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump.
    Paul lay awake wondering: What's a gom jabbar?
    In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen. 
    Your Reverence.
    And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was -- a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke's concubine and mother of the ducal heir.
    Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he wondered.
    He mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar . . . Kwisatz Haderach.
    There had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so different from Caladan that Paul's mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet.
    Thufir Hawat, his father's Master of Assassins, had explained it: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete -- an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad.
    "A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful," Hawat had said.
    Arrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet.
    Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound -- the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. 
    The dream faded.
    Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed -- thinking . . . thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. 
    Arrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet.
    Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness . . . focusing the consciousness . . . aortal dilation . . . avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness . . . to be conscious by choice . . . blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions . . . one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone . . . animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct . . . the animal destroys and does not produce . . . animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual . . . the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe . . . focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid . . . bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs . . . all things/cells/beings are impermanent . . . strive for flow-permanence within . . . 
    Over and over and over within Paul's floating awareness the lesson rolled.
    When dawn touched Paul's window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling.
    The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with a black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly. 
    "You're awake," she said. "Did you sleep well?" 
    "Yes."
    He studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way -- in the minutiae of observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket.
    "Hurry and dress," she said. "Reverend Mother is waiting." 
    "I dreamed of her once," Paul said. "Who is she?" 
    "She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she's the Emperor's Truthsayer. And Paul . . . " She hesitated. "You must tell her about your dreams."
    "I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?"
    "We did not get Arrakis." Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. "Don't keep Reverend Mother waiting." 
    Paul sat up, hugged his knees. "What's a gom jabbar?" 
    Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear.
    Jessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the river orchards toward Mount Syubi. "You'll learn about . . . the gom jabbar soon enough," she said. 
    He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it.
    Jessica spoke without turning. "Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry."

    The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam sat in a tapestried chair watching mother and son approach. Windows on each side of her overlooked the curving southern bend of the river and the green farmlands of the Atreides family holding, but the Reverend Mother ignored the view. She was feeling her age this morning, more than a little petulant. She blamed it on space travel and association with that abominable Spacing Guild and its secretive ways. But here was a mission that required personal attention from a Bene Gesserit-with-the-Sight. Even the Padishah Emperor's Truthsayer couldn't evade that responsibility when the duty call came.
    Damn that Jessica! the Reverend Mother thought. If only she 'd borne us a girl as she was ordered to do!
    Jessica stopped three paces from the chair, dropped a small curtsy, a gentle flick of left hand along the line of her skirt. Paul gave the short bow his dancing master had taught -- the one used "when in doubt of another's station."
    The nuances of Paul's greeting were not lost on the Reverend Mother. She said: "He's a cautious one, Jessica." 
    Jessica's hand went to Paul's shoulder, tightened there. For a heartbeat, fear pulsed through her palm. Then she had herself under control. "Thus he has been taught, Your Reverence." 
    What does she fear? Paul wondered.
    The old woman studied Paul in one gestalten flicker: face oval like Jessica's, but strong bones . . . hair: the Duke's black-black but with browline of the maternal grandfather who cannot be named, and that thin, disdainful nose; shape of directly staring green eyes: like the old Duke, the paternal grandfather who is dead.
    Now, there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura -- even in death, the Reverend Mother thought.
    "Teaching is one thing," she said, "the basic ingredient is another. We shall see." The old eyes darted a hard glance at Jessica. "Leave us. I enjoin you to practice the meditation of peace."
    Jessica took her hand from Paul's shoulder. "Your Reverence, I --" 
    "Jessica, you know it must be done." 
    Paul looked up at his mother, puzzled. 
    Jessica straightened. "Yes . . . of course."
    Paul looked back at the Reverend Mother. Politeness and his mother's obvious awe of this old woman argued caution. Yet he felt an angry apprehension at the fear he sensed radiating from his mother.
    "Paul . . . " Jessica took a deep breath. ". . . this test you're about to receive . . . it's important to me." 
    "Test?" He looked up at her.
    "Remember that you're a duke's son, "Jessica said. She whirled and strode from the room in a dry swishing of skirt. The door closed solidly behind her.
    Paul faced the old woman, holding anger in check. "Does one dismiss the Lady Jessica as though she were a serving wench?" 
    A smile flicked the corners of the wrinkled old mouth. "The Lady Jessica was my serving wench, lad, for fourteen years at school." She nodded. "And a good one, too. Now, you come here!"
    The command whipped out at him. Paul found himself obeying before he could think about it. Using the Voice on me, he thought. He stopped at her gesture, standing beside her knees.
    "See this?" she asked. From the folds of her gown, she lifted a green metal cube about fifteen centimeters on a side. She turned it and Paul saw that one side was open -- black and oddly frightening. No light penetrated that open blackness. 
    "Put your right hand in the box," she said.
    Fear shot through Paul. He started to back away, but the old woman said: "Is this how you obey your mother?" 
    He looked up into bird-bright eyes.
    Slowly, feeling the compulsions and unable to inhibit them, Paul put his hand into the box. He felt first a sense of cold as the blackness closed around his hand, then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling as though his hand were asleep.
    A predatory look filled the old woman's features. She lifted her right hand away from the box and poised the hand close to the side of Paul's neck. He saw a glint of metal there and started to turn toward
    "Stop!" she snapped.
    Using the Voice again! He swung his attention back to her face.
    "I hold at your neck the gom jabbar," she said. "The gom jabbar, the high-handed enemy. It's a needle with a drop of poison on its tip. Ah-ah! Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison." 
    Paul tried to swallow in a dry throat. He could not take his attention from the seamed old face, the glistening eyes, the pale gums around silvery metal teeth that flashed as she spoke.
    "A duke's son must know about poisons," she said. "It's the way of our times, eh? Musky, to be poisoned in your drink. Aumas, to be poisoned in your food. The quick ones and the slow ones and the ones in between. Here's a new one for you: the gom jabbar. It kills only animals."
    Pride overcame Paul's fear. "You dare suggest a duke's son is an animal?" he demanded.
    "Let us say I suggest you may be human," she said. "Steady! I warn you not to try jerking away. I am old, but my hand can drive this needle into your neck before you escape me." 
    "Who are you?" he whispered. "How did you trick my mother into leaving me alone with you? Are you from the Harkonnens?" 
    "The Harkonnens? Bless us, no! Now, be silent." A dry finger touched his neck and he stilled the involuntary urge to leap away.
    "Good," she said. "You pass the first test. Now, here's the way of the rest of it: If you withdraw your hand from the box you die. This is the only rule. Keep your hand in the box and live. Withdraw it and die."
    Paul took a deep breath to still his trembling. "If I call out there'll be servants on you in seconds and you'll die."
    "Servants will not pass your mother who stands guard outside that door. Depend on it. Your mother survived this test. Now it's your turn. Be honored. We seldom administer this to men-children."
    Curiosity reduced Paul's fear to a manageable level. He heard truth in the old woman's voice, no denying it. If his mother stood guard out there . . . if this were truly a test . . . And whatever it was, he knew himself caught in it, trapped by that hand at his neck: the gom jabbar. He recalled the response from the Litany against Fear as his mother had taught him out of the Bene Gesserit rite.
    "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
    He felt calmness return, said: "Get on with it, old woman." 
    "Old woman!" she snapped. "You've courage, and that can't be denied. Well, we shall see, sirra." She bent close, lowered her voice almost to a whisper. "You will feel pain in this hand within the box. Pain. But! Withdraw the hand and I'll touch your neck with my gom jabbar -- the death so swift it's like the fall of the headsman's axe. Withdraw your hand and the gom jabbar takes you. Understand?" 
    "What's in the box?" 
    "Pain."
    He felt increased tingling in his hand, pressed his lips tightly together. How could this be a test? he wondered. The tingling became an itch.
    The old woman said; "You've heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? There's an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind."
    The itch became the faintest burning. "Why are you doing this?" he demanded.
    "To determine if you're human. Be silent."
    Paul clenched his left hand into a fist as the burning sensation increased in the other hand. It mounted slowly: heat upon heat upon heat . . . upon heat. He felt the fingernails of his free hand biting the palm. He tried to flex the fingers of the burning hand, but couldn't move them.
    "It burns," he whispered. 
    "Silence!"
    Pain throbbed up his arm. Sweat stood out on his forehead. Every fiber cried out to withdraw the hand from that burning pit . . . but . . . the gom jabbar. Without turning his head, he tried to move his eyes to see that terrible needle poised beside his neck. He sensed that he was breathing in gasps, tried to slow his breaths and couldn't. 
    Pain!
    His world emptied of everything except that hand immersed in agony, the ancient face inches away staring at him. 
    His lips were so dry he had difficulty separating them. 
    The burning! The burning!
    He thought he could feel skin curling black on that agonized hand, the flesh crisping and dropping away until only charred bones remained.
    It stopped!
    As though a switch had been turned off, the pain stopped.
    Paul felt his right arm trembling, felt sweat bathing his body.
    "Enough," the old woman muttered. "Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must've wanted you to fail." She leaned back, withdrawing the gom jabbar from the side of his neck. "Take your hand from the box, young human, and look at it." 
    He fought down an aching shiver, stared at the lightless void where his hand seemed to remain of its own volition. Memory of pain inhibited every movement. Reason told him he would withdraw a blackened stump from that box. 
    "Do it!" she snapped.
    He jerked his hand from the box, stared at it astonished. Not a mark. No sign of agony on the flesh. He held up the hand, turned it, flexed the fingers.
    "Pain by nerve induction," she said. "Can't go around maiming potential humans. There're those who'd give a pretty for the secret of this box, though." She slipped it into the folds of her gown.
    "But the pain --" he said.
    "Pain," she sniffed. "A human can override any nerve in the body."
    Paul felt his left hand aching, uncurled the clenched fingers, looked at four bloody marks where fingernails had bitten his palm. He dropped the hand to his side, looked at the old woman. "You did that to my mother once?" 
    "Ever sift sand through a screen?" she asked.
    The tangential slash of her question shocked his mind into a higher awareness: Sand through a screen, he nodded. 
    "We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans." 
    He lifted his right hand, willing the memory of the pain. "And that's all there is to it -- pain?"
    "I observed you in pain, lad. Pain's merely the axis of the test. Your mother's told you about our ways of observing. I see the signs of her teaching in you. Our test is crisis and observation." 
    He heard the confirmation in her voice, said: "It's truth!" 
    She stared at him. He senses truth! Could he be the one? Could he truly be the one? She extinguished the excitement, reminding herself: "Hope clouds observation." 
    "You know when people believe what they say," she said. 
    "I know it."
    The harmonics of ability confirmed by repeated test were in his voice. She heard them, said: "Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach. Sit down, little brother, here at my feet." 
    "I prefer to stand."
    "Your mother sat at my feet once." 
    "I'm not my mother."
    "You hate us a little, eh?" She looked toward the door, called out: "Jessica!"
    The door flew open and Jessica stood there staring hard-eyed into the room. Hardness melted from her as she saw Paul. She managed a faint smile.
    "Jessica, have you ever stopped hating me?" the old woman asked.
    "I both love and hate you," Jessica said. "The hate -- that's from pains I must never forget. The love -- that's . . . " 
    "Just the basic fact," the old woman said, but her voice was gentle. "You may come in now, but remain silent. Close that door and mind it that no one interrupts us."
    Jessica stepped into the room, closed the door and stood with her back to it. My son lives, she thought. My son lives and is . . . human. I knew he was . . . but . . . he lives. Now, I can go on living. The door felt hard and real against her back. Everything in the room was immediate and pressing against her senses. 
    My son lives.
    Paul looked at his mother. She told the truth. He wanted to get away alone and think this experience through, but knew he could not leave until he was dismissed. The old woman had gained a power over him. They spoke truth. His mother had undergone this test. There must be terrible purpose in it . . . the pain and fear had been terrible. He understood terrible purposes. They drove against all odds. They were their own necessity. Paul felt that he had been infected with terrible purpose. He did not know yet what the terrible purpose was.
    "Some day, lad," the old woman said, "you, too, may have to stand outside a door like that. It takes a measure of doing." 
    Paul looked down at the hand that had known pain, then up to the Reverend Mother. The sound of her voice had contained a difference then from any other voice in his experience. The words were outlined in brilliance. There was an edge to them. He felt that any question he might ask her would bring an answer that could lift him out of his flesh-world into something greater. 
    "Why do you test for humans?" he asked. 
    "To set you free." 
    "Free?"
    "Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them."
    " 'Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind,' " Paul quoted.
    "Right out of the Butlerian Jihad and the Orange Catholic Bible," she said. "But what the O.C. Bible should've said is: 'Thou shalt not make a machine to counterfeit a human mind.' Have you studied the Mentat in your service?" 
    "I've studied with Thufir Hawat."
    "The Great Revolt took away a crutch," she said. "It forced human minds to develop. Schools were started to train human talents. " 
    "Bene Gesserit schools?"
    She nodded. "We have two chief survivors of those ancient schools: the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. The Guild, so we think, emphasizes almost pure mathematics. Bene Gesserit performs another function." 
    "Politics," he said.
    "Kull wahad!" the old woman said. She sent a hard glance at Jessica.
    "I've not told him. Your Reverence," Jessica said.
    The Reverend Mother returned her attention to Paul. "You did that on remarkably few clues," she said. "Politics indeed. The original Bene Gesserit school was directed by those who saw the need of a thread of continuity in human affairs. They saw there could be no such continuity without separating human stock from animal stock -- for breeding purposes."
    The old woman's words abruptly lost their special sharpness for Paul. He felt an offense against what his mother called his instinct for rightness. It wasn't that Reverend Mother lied to him. She obviously believed what she said. It was something deeper, something tied to his terrible purpose.
    He said: "But my mother tells me many Bene Gesserit of the schools don't know their ancestry."
    "The genetic lines are always in our records," she said. "Your mother knows that either she's of Bene Gesserit descent or her stock was acceptable in itself." 
    "Then why couldn't she know who her parents are?" 
    "Some do . . . Many don't. We might, for example, have wanted to breed her to a close relative to set up a dominant in some genetic trait. We have many reasons."
    Again, Paul felt the offense against rightness. He said: "You take a lot on yourselves."
    The Reverend Mother stared at him, wondering: Did I hear criticism in his voice? "We carry a heavy burden," she said.
    Paul felt himself coming more and more out of the shock of the test. He leveled a measuring stare at her, said: "You say maybe I'm the . . . Kwisatz Haderach. What's that, a human gom jabbar?" 
    "Paul," Jessica said. "You mustn't take that tone with --" 
    "I'll handle this, Jessica," the old woman said. "Now, lad, do you know about the Truthsayer drug?"
    "You take it to improve your ability to detect falsehood," he said. "My mother's told me." 
    "Have you ever seen truthtrance?" 
    He shook his head. "No."
    "The drug's dangerous," she said, "but it gives insight. When a Truthsayer's gifted by the drug, she can look many places in her memory -- in her body's memory. We look down so many avenues of the past . . . but only feminine avenues." Her voice took on a note of sadness. "Yet, there's a place where no Truthsayer can see. We are repelled by it, terrorized. It is said a man will come one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye. He will look where we cannot -- into both feminine and masculine pasts." 
    "Your Kwisatz Haderach?"
    "Yes, the one who can be many places at once: the Kwisatz Haderach. Many men have tried the drug . . . so many, but none has succeeded." 
    "They tried and failed, all of them?" 
    "Oh, no." She shook her head. "They tried and died."

To attempt an understanding of Muad'Dib without understanding his mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, is to attempt seeing Truth without knowing Falsehood. It is the attempt to see the Light without knowing Darkness. It cannot be.
-from "Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    It was a relief globe of a world, partly in shadows, spinning under the impetus of a fat hand that glittered with rings. The globe sat on a freeform stand at one wall of a windowless room whose other walls presented a patchwork of multicolored scrolls, filmbooks, tapes and reels. Light glowed in the room from golden balls hanging in mobile suspensor fields.
    An ellipsoid desk with a top of jade-pink petrified elacca wood stood at the center of the room. Veriform suspensor chairs ringed it, two of them occupied. In one sat a dark-haired youth of about sixteen years, round of face and with sullen eyes. The other held a slender, short man with effeminate face.
    Both youth and man stared at the globe and the man half-hidden in shadows spinning it.
    A chuckle sounded beside the globe. A basso voice rumbled out of the chuckle: "There it is, Piter -- the biggest mantrap in all history. And the Duke's headed into its jaws. Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?" 
    "Assuredly, Baron," said the man. His voice came out tenor with a sweet, musical quality.
    The fat hand descended onto the globe, stopped the spinning. Now, all eyes in the room could focus on the motionless surface and see that it was the kind of globe made for wealthy collectors or planetary governors of the Empire. It had the stamp of Imperial handicraft about it. Latitude and longitude lines were laid in with hair-fine platinum wire. The polar caps were insets of finest cloud-milk diamonds.
    The fat hand moved, tracing details on the surface. "I invite you to observe," the basso voice rumbled. "Observe closely, Piter, and you, too, Feyd-Rautha, my darling: from sixty degrees north to seventy degrees south -- these exquisite ripples. Their coloring: does it not remind you of sweet caramels? And nowhere do you see blue of lakes or rivers or seas. And these lovely polar caps -- so small. Could anyone mistake this place? Arrakis! Truly unique. A superb setting for a unique Victory."
    A smile touched Piter's lips. "And to think. Baron: the Padishah Emperor believes he's given the Duke your spice planet. How poignant."
    "That's a nonsensical statement," the Baron rumbled. "You say this to confuse young Feyd-Rautha, but it is not necessary to confuse my nephew."
    The sullen-faced youth stirred in his chair, smoothed a wrinkle in the black leotards he wore. He sat upright as a discreet tapping sounded at the door in the wall behind him.
    Piter unfolded from his chair, crossed to the door, cracked it wide enough to accept a message cylinder. He closed the door, unrolled the cylinder and scanned it. A chuckle sounded from him. Another.
    "Well?" the Baron demanded.
    "The fool answered us, Baron!"
    "Whenever did an Atreides refuse the opportunity for a gesture?" the Baron asked. "Well, what does he say?" 
    "He's most uncouth, Baron. Addresses you as 'Harkonnen' -- no 'Sire et Cher Cousin,' no title, nothing."
    "It's a good name," the Baron growled, and his voice betrayed his impatience. "What does dear Leto say?"
    "He says: 'Your offer of a meeting is refused. I have ofttimes met your treachery and this all men know.' " 
    "And?" the Baron asked.
    "He says: 'The art of kanly still has admirers in the Empire.' He signs it: 'Duke Leto of Arrakis.' " Piter began to laugh. "Of Arrakis! Oh, my! This is almost too rich!"
    "Be silent, Piter," the Baron said, and the laughter stopped as though shut off with a switch. "Kanly, is it?" the Baron asked. "Vendetta, heh? And he uses the nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure I know he means it."
    "You made the peace gesture," Piter said. "The forms have been obeyed."
    "For a Mentat, you talk too much, Piter," the Baron said. And he thought: I must do away with that one soon. He has almost outlived his usefulness. The Baron stared across the room at his Mental assassin, seeing the feature about him that most people noticed first: the eyes, the shaded slits of blue within blue, the eyes without any white in them at all.
    A grin flashed across Piter's face. It was like a mask grimace beneath those eyes like holes. "But, Baron! Never has revenge been more beautiful. It is to see a plan of the most exquisite treachery: to make Leto exchange Caladan for Dune -- and without alternative because the Emperor orders it. How waggish of you!" 
    In a cold voice, the Baron said: "You have a flux of the mouth, Piter."
    "But I am happy, my Baron. Whereas you . . . you are touched by jealousy." 
    "Piter!"
    "Ah-ah. Baron! Is it not regrettable you were unable to devise this delicious scheme by yourself?"
    "Someday I will have you strangled, Piter." 
    "Of a certainty, Baron. Enfin! But a kind act is never lost, eh?" 
    "Have you been chewing verite or semuta, Piter?" 
    "Truth without fear surprises the Baron," Piter said. His face drew down into a caricature of a frowning mask. "Ah, hah! But you see, Baron, I know as a Mentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back just so long as I am useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I'm yet of much use. I know what it is you learned from that lovely Dune planet -- waste not. True, Baron?" 
    The Baron continued to stare at Piter.
    Feyd-Rautha squirmed in his chair. These wrangling fools! he thought. My uncle cannot talk to his Mental without arguing. Do they think I've nothing to do except listen their arguments?
    "Feyd," the Baron said. "I told you to listen and learn when I invited you in here. Are you learning?" 
    "Yes, Uncle." the voice was carefully subservient.
    "Sometimes I wonder about Piter," the Baron said. "I cause pain out of necessity, but he . . . I swear he takes a positive delight in it. For myself, I can feel pity toward the poor Duke Leto. Dr. Yueh will move against him soon, and that'll be the end of all the Atreides. But surely Leto will know whose hand directed the pliant doctor . . . and knowing that will be a terrible thing." 
    "Then why haven't you directed the doctor to slip a kindjal between his ribs quietly and efficiently?" Piter asked. "You talk of pity, but --"
    "The Duke must know when I encompass his doom," the Baron said. "And the other Great Houses must learn of it. The knowledge will give them pause. I'll gain a bit more room to maneuver. The necessity is obvious, but I don't have to like it."
    "Room to maneuver," Piter sneered. "Already you have the Emperor's eyes on you, Baron. You move too boldly. One day the Emperor will send a legion or two of his Sardaukar down here onto Giedi Prime and that'll be an end to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen."
    "You'd like to see that, wouldn't you, Piter?" the Baron asked. "You'd enjoy seeing the Corps of Sardaukar pillage through my cities and sack this castle. You'd truly enjoy that." 
    "Does the Baron need to ask?" Piter whispered.
    "You should've been a Bashar of the Corps," the Baron said. "You're too interested in blood and pain. Perhaps I was too quick with my promise of the spoils of Arrakis."
    Piter took five curiously mincing steps into the room, stopped directly behind Feyd-Rautha. There was a tight air of tension in the room, and the youth looked up at Piter with a worried frown.
    "Do not toy with Piter, Baron," Piter said. "You promised me the Lady Jessica. You promised her to me." 
    "For what, Piter?" the Baron asked. "For pain?" 
    Piter stared at him, dragging out the silence.
    Feyd-Rautha moved his suspensor chair to one side, said: "Uncle, do I have to stay? You said you'd --"
    "My darling Feyd-Rautha grows impatient," the Baron said. He moved within the shadows beside the globe. "Patience, Feyd." And he turned his attention back to the Mentat. "What of the Dukeling, the child Paul, my dear Piter?" 
    "The trap will bring him to you, Baron," Piter muttered.
    "That's not my question," the Baron said. "You'll recall that you predicted the Bene Gesserit witch would bear a daughter to the Duke. You were wrong, eh, Mentat?"
    "I'm not often wrong, Baron," Piter said, and for the first time there was fear in his voice. "Give me that: I'm not often wrong. And you know yourself these Bene Gesserit bear mostly daughters. Even the Emperor's consort had produced only females." 
    "Uncle," said Feyd-Rautha, "you said there'd be something important here for me to --"
    "Listen to my nephew," the Baron said. "He aspires to rule my Barony, yet he cannot rule himself." The Baron stirred beside the globe, a shadow among shadows. "Well then, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, I summoned you here hoping to teach you a bit of wisdom. Have you observed our good Mentat? You should've learned something from this exchange." 
    "But, Uncle --" 
    "A most efficient Mentat, Piter, wouldn't you say, Feyd?" 
    "Yes, but --"
    "Ah! Indeed but! But he consumes too much spice, eats it like candy. Look at his eyes! He might've come directly from the Arrakeen labor pool. Efficient, Piter, but he's still emotional and prone to passionate outbursts. Efficient, Piter, but he still can err."
    Piter spoke in a low, sullen tone: "Did you call me in here to impair my efficiency with criticism, Baron?"
    "Impair your efficiency? You know me better, Piter. I wish only for my nephew to understand the limitations of a Mentat." 
    "Are you already training my replacement?" Piter demanded.
    "Replace you? Why, Piter, where could I find another Mentat with your cunning and venom?" 
    "The same place you found me, Baron."
    "Perhaps I should at that," the Baron mused. "You do seem a bit unstable lately. And the spice you eat!"
    "Are my pleasures too expensive, Baron? Do you object to them?"
    "My dear Piter, your pleasures are what tie you to me. How could I object to that? I merely wish my nephew to observe this about you."
    "Then I'm on display," Piter said. "Shall I dance? Shall I perform my various functions for the eminent Feyd-Rau-" 
    "Precisely," the Baron said. "You are on display. Now, be silent." He glanced at Feyd-Rautha, noting his nephew's lips, the full and pouting look of them, the Harkonnen genetic marker, now twisted slightly in amusement. "This is a Mentat, Feyd. It has been trained and conditioned to perform certain duties. The fact that it's encased in a human body, however, must not be overlooked. A serious drawback, that. I sometimes think the ancients with their thinking machines had the right idea."
    "They were toys compared to me," Piter snarled. "You yourself, Baron, could outperform those machines."
    "Perhaps," the Baron said. "Ah, well . . . " He took a deep breath, belched. "Now, Piter, outline for my nephew the salient features of our campaign against the House of Atreides. Function as a Mentat for us, if you please."
    "Baron, I've warned you not to trust one so young with this information. My observations of --"
    "I'll be the judge of this," the Baron said. "I give you an order, Mentat. Perform one of your various functions."
    "So be it," Piter said. He straightened, assuming an odd attitude of dignity -- as though it were another mask, but this time clothing his entire body. "In a few days Standard, the entire household of the Duke Leto will embark on a Spacing Guild liner for Arrakis. The Guild will deposit them at the city of Arrakeen rather than at our city of Carthag. The Duke's Mentat, Thufir Hawat, will have concluded rightly that Arrakeen is easier to defend."
    "Listen carefully, Feyd," the Baron said. "Observe the plans within plans within plans."
    Feyd-Rautha nodded, thinking: This is more like it. The old monster is letting me in on secret things at last. He must really mean for me to be his heir.
    "There are several tangential possibilities," Piter said. "I indicate that House Atreides will go to Arrakis. We must not, however, ignore the possibility the Duke has contracted with the Guild to remove him to a place of safety outside the System. Others in like circumstances have become renegade Houses, taking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the Imperium." 
    "The Duke's too proud a man for that," the Baron said.
    "It is a possibility," Piter said. "The ultimate effect for us would be the same, however."
    "No, it would not!" the Baron growled. "I must have him dead and his line ended."
    "That's the high probability," Piter said. "There are certain preparations that indicate when a House is going renegade. The Duke appears to be doing none of these things." 
    "So," the Baron sighed. "Get on with it, Piter." 
    "At Arrakeen," Piter said, "the Duke and his family will occupy the Residency, lately the home of Count and Lady Fenring." 
    "The Ambassador to the Smugglers," the Baron chuckled. 
    "Ambassador to what?" Feyd-Rautha asked.
    "Your uncle makes a joke," Piter said. "He calls Count Fenring Ambassador to the Smugglers, indicating the Emperor's interest in smuggling operations on Arrakis." 
    Feyd-Rautha turned a puzzled stare on his uncle. "Why?" 
    "Don't be dense, Feyd," the Baron snapped. "As long as the Guild remains effectively outside Imperial control, how could it be otherwise? How else could spies and assassins move about?" 
    Feyd-Rautha's mouth made a soundless "Oh-h-h-h." 
    "We've arranged diversions at the Residency," Piter said. "There'll be an attempt on the life of the Atreides heir -- an attempt which could succeed." 
    "Piter," the Baron rumbled, "you indicated --" 
    "I indicated accidents can happen," Piter said. "And the attempt must appear valid."
    "Ah, but the lad has such a sweet young body," the Baron said. "Of course, he's potentially more dangerous than the father . . . with that witch mother training him. Accursed woman! Ah, well, please continue, Piter."
    "Hawat will have divined that we have an agent planted on him," Piter said. "The obvious suspect is Dr. Yueh, who is indeed our agent. But Hawat has investigated and found that our doctor is a Suk School graduate with Imperial Conditioning -- supposedly safe enough to minister even to the Emperor. Great store is set on Imperial Conditioning. It's assumed that ultimate conditioning cannot be removed without killing the subject. However, as someone once observed, given the right lever you can move a planet. We found the lever that moved the doctor."
    "How?" Feyd-Rautha asked. He found this a fascinating subject. Everyone knew you couldn't subvert Imperial Conditioning! 
    "Another time," the Baron said. "Continue, Piter." 
    "In place of Yueh," Piter said, "we'll drag a most interesting suspect across Hawat's path. The very audacity of this suspect will recommend her to Hawat's attention." 
    "Her?" Feyd-Rautha asked.
    "The Lady Jessica herself," the Baron said.
    "Is it not sublime?" Piter asked. "Hawat's mind will be so filled with this prospect it'll impair his function as a Mentat. He may even try to kill her." Piter frowned, then: "But I don't think he'll be able to carry it off." 
    "You don't want him to, eh?" the Baron asked.
    "Don't distract me," Piter said. "While Hawat's occupied with the Lady Jessica, we'll divert him further with uprisings in a few garrison towns and the like. These will be put down. The Duke must believe he's gaining a measure of security. Then, when the moment is ripe, we'll signal Yueh and move in with our major force . . . ah . . . " 
    "Go ahead, tell him all of it," the Baron said.
    "We'll move in strengthened by two legions of Sardaukar disguised in Harkonnen livery."
    "Sardaukar!" Feyd-Rautha breathed. His mind focused on the dread Imperial troops, the killers without mercy, the soldier fanatics of the Padishah Emperor.
    "You see how I trust you, Feyd," the Baron said. "No hint of this must ever reach another Great House, else the Landsraad might unite against the Imperial House and there'd be chaos." 
    "The main point," Piter said, "is this: since House Harkonnen is being used to do the Imperial dirty work, we've gained a true advantage. It's a dangerous advantage, to be sure, but if used cautiously, will bring House Harkonnen greater wealth than that of any other House in the Imperium."
    "You have no idea how much wealth is involved, Feyd," the Baron said. "Not in your wildest imaginings. To begin, we'll have an irrevocable directorship in the CHOAM Company." 
    Feyd-Rautha nodded. Wealth was the thing. CHOAM was the key to wealth, each noble House dipping from the company's coffers whatever it could under the power of the directorships. Those CHOAM directorships -- they were the real evidence of political power in the Imperium, passing with the shifts of voting strength within the Landsraad as it balanced itself against the Emperor and his supporters.
    "The Duke Leto," Piter said, "may attempt to flee to the new Fremen scum along the desert's edge. Or he may try to send his family into that imagined security. But that path is blocked by one of His Majesty's agents -- the planetary ecologist. You may remember him -- Kynes." 
    "Feyd remembers him," the Baron said. "Get on with it." 
    "You do not drool very prettily, Baron," Piter said. 
    "Get on with it, I command you!" the Baron roared.
    Piter shrugged. "If matters go as planned," he said, "House Harkonnen will have a subfief on Arrakis within a Standard year. Your uncle will have dispensation of that fief. His own personal agent will rule on Arrakis." 
    "More profits," Feyd-Rautha said.
    "Indeed," the Baron said. And he thought: It's only just. We're the ones who tamed Arrakis . . .except for the few mongrel Fremen hiding in the skirts of the desert . . . and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almost as tightly as the native labor pool.
    "And the Great Houses will know that the Baron has destroyed the Atreides," Piter said. "They will know." 
    "They will know," the Baron breathed.
    "Loveliest of all," Piter said, "is that the Duke will know, too. He knows now. He can already feel the trap."
    "It's true the Duke knows," the Baron said, and his voice held a note of sadness. "He could not help but know . . . more's the pity."
    The Baron moved out and away from the globe of Arrakis. As he emerged from the shadows, his figure took on dimension -- grossly and immensely fat. And with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this fat was sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He might weigh two hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his feet would carry no more than fifty of them.
    "I am hungry," the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his protruding lips with a beringed hand, stared down at Feyd-Rautha through fat-enfolded eyes. "Send for food, my darling. We will eat before we retire."

Thus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: "The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure. For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness."
-from "Muad'Dib, Family Commentaries" by the Princess Irulan

    "Well, Jessica, what have you to say for yourself?" asked the Reverend Mother.
    It was near sunset at Castle Caladan on the day of Paul's ordeal. The two women were alone in Jessica's morning room while Paul waited in the adjoining soundproofed Meditation Chamber.
    Jessica stood facing the south windows. She saw and yet did not see the evening's banked colors across meadow and river. She heard and yet did not hear the Reverend Mother's question.
    There had been another ordeal once -- so many years ago. A skinny girl with hair the color of bronze, her body tortured by the winds of puberty, had entered the study of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Proctor Superior of the Bene Gesserit school on Wallach IX. Jessica looked down at her right hand, flexed the fingers, remembering the pain, the terror, the anger. 
    "Poor Paul," she whispered.
    "I asked you a question, Jessica!" The old woman's voice was snappish, demanding.
    "What? Oh . . . " Jessica tore her attention away from the past, faced the Reverend Mother, who sat with back to the stone wall between the two west windows. "What do you want me to say?" 
    "What do I want you to say? What do I want you to say?" The old voice carried a tone of cruel mimicry.
    "So I had a son!" Jessica flared. And she knew she was being goaded into this anger deliberately.
    "You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides." 
    "It meant so much to him," Jessica pleaded.
    "And you in your pride thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach!" 
    Jessica lifted her chin. "I sensed the possibility." 
    "You thought only of your Duke's desire for a son," the old woman snapped. "And his desires don't figure in this. An Atreides daughter could've been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. You've hopelessly complicated matters. We may lose both bloodlines now."
    "You're not infallible," Jessica said. She braved the steady stare from the old eyes.
    Presently, the old woman muttered: "What's done is done." 
    "I vowed never to regret my decision," Jessica said.
    "How noble," the Reverend Mother sneered. "No regrets. We shall see when you're a fugitive with a price on your head and every man's hand turned against you to seek your life and the life of your son." 
    Jessica paled. "Is there no alternative?" 
    "Alternative? A Bene Gesserit should ask that?" 
    "I ask only what you see in the future with your superior abilities."
    "I see in the future what I've seen in the past. You well know the pattern of our affairs, Jessica. The race knows its own mortality and fears stagnation of its heredity. It's in the bloodstream -- the urge to mingle genetic strains without plan. The Imperium, the CHOAM Company, all the Great Houses, they are but bits of flotsam in the path of the flood."
    "CHOAM," Jessica muttered. "I suppose it's already decided how they'll redivide the spoils of Arrakis."
    "What is CHOAM but the weather vane of our times," the old woman said. "The Emperor and his friends now command fifty-nine point six-five per cent of the CHOAM directorship's votes. Certainly they smell profits, and likely as others smell those same profits his voting strength will increase. This is the pattern of history, girl."
    "That's certainly what I need right now," Jessica said. "A review of history."
    "Don't be facetious, girl! You know as well as I do what forces surround us. We've a three-point civilization: the Imperial Household balanced against the Federated Great Houses of the Landsraad, and between them, the Guild with its damnable monopoly on interstellar transport. In politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures. It'd be bad enough without the complication of a feudal trade culture which turns its back on most science." 
    Jessica spoke bitterly: "Chips in the path of the flood -- and this chip here, this is the Duke Leto, and this one's his son, and this one's --"
    "Oh, shut up, girl. You entered this with full knowledge of the delicate edge you walked." 
    " 'I am Bene Gesserit: I exist only to serve,' " Jessica quoted. 
    "Truth." the old woman said. "And all we can hope for now is to prevent this from erupting into general conflagration, to salvage what we can of the key bloodlines."
    Jessica closed her eyes, feeling tears press out beneath the lids. She fought down the inner trembling, the outer trembling, the uneven breathing, the ragged pulse, the sweating of the palms. Presently, she said, "I'll pay for my own mistake." 
    "And your son will pay with you." 
    "I'll shield him as well as I'm able."
    "Shield!" the old woman snapped. "You well know the weakness there! Shield your son too much, Jessica, and he'll not grow strong enough to fulfill any destiny."
    Jessica turned away, looked out the window at the gathering darkness. "Is it really that terrible, this planet of Arrakis?" 
    "Bad enough, but not all bad. The Missionaria Protectiva has been in there and softened it up somewhat." The Reverend Mother heaved herself to her feet, straightened a fold in her gown. "Call the boy in here. I must be leaving soon." 
    "Must you?"
    The old woman's voice softened. "Jessica, girl, I wish I could stand in your place and take your sufferings. But each of us must make her own path." 
    "I know."
    "You're as dear to me as any of my own daughters, but I cannot let that interfere with duty." 
    "I understand . . . the necessity."
    "What you did, Jessica, and why you did it -- we both know. But kindness forces me to tell you there's little chance your lad will be the Bene Gesserit Totality. You mustn't let yourself hope too much."
    Jessica shook tears from the corners of her eyes. It was an angry gesture. "You make me feel like a little girl again -- reciting my first lesson." She forced the words out: " 'Humans must never submit to animals.' " A dry sob shook her. In a low voice, she said: "I've been so lonely."
    "It should be one of the tests," the old woman said. "Humans are almost always lonely. Now summon the boy. He's had a long, frightening day. But he's had time to think and remember, and I must ask the other questions about these dreams of his." 
    Jessica nodded, went to the door of the Meditation Chamber, opened it. "Paul, come in now, please."
    Paul emerged with a stubborn slowness. He stared at his mother as though she were a stranger. Wariness veiled his eyes when he glanced at the Reverend Mother, but this time he nodded to her, the nod one gives an equal. He heard his mother close the door behind him.
    "Young man," the old woman said, "let's return to this dream business." 
    "What do you want?" 
    "Do you dream every night?"
    "Not dreams worth remembering. I can remember every dream, but some are worth remembering and some aren't." 
    "How do you know the difference?" 
    "I just know it."
    The old woman glanced at Jessica, back to Paul. "What did you dream last night? Was it worth remembering?"
    "Yes." Paul closed his eyes. "I dreamed a cavern . . . and water . . . and a girl there -- very skinny with big eyes. Her eyes are all blue, no whites in them. I talk to her and tell her about you, about seeing the Reverend Mother on Caladan." Paul opened his eyes.
    "And the thing you tell this strange girl about seeing me, did it happen today?"
    Paul thought about this, then: "Yes. I tell the girl you came and put a stamp of strangeness on me."
    "Stamp of strangeness," the old woman breathed, and again she shot a glance at Jessica, returned her attention to Paul. "Tell me truly now, Paul, do you often have dreams of things that happen afterward exactly as you dreamed them?" 
    "Yes. And I've dreamed about that girl before." 
    "Oh? You know her?" 
    "I will know her." 
    "Tell me about her."
    Again, Paul closed his eyes. "We're in a little place in some rocks where it's sheltered. It's almost night, but it's hot and I can see patches of sand out of an opening in the rocks. We're . . . waiting for something . . . for me to go meet some people. And she's frightened but trying to hide it from me, and I'm excited. And she says: 'Tell me about the waters of your homeworld, Usul.' " Paul opened his eyes. "Isn't that strange? My homeworld's Caladan. I've never even heard of a planet called Usul." 
    "Is there more to this dream?" Jessica prompted.
    "Yes. But maybe she was calling me Usul," Paul said. "I just thought of that." Again, he closed his eyes. "She asks me to tell her about the waters. And I take her hand. And I say I'll tell her a poem. And I tell her the poem, but I have to explain some of the words -- like beach and surf and seaweed and seagulls." 
    "What poem?" the Reverend Mother asked.
    Paul opened his eyes. "It's just one of Gurney Halleck's tone poems for sad times." 
    Behind Paul Jessica began to recite:

"I remember salt smoke from a beach fire 
And shadows under the pines --
Solid, clean . . . fixed --
Seagulls perched at the tip of land, 
White upon green . . . 
And a wind comes through the pines 
To sway the shadows; 
The seagulls spread their wings, 
Lift 
And fill the sky with screeches. 
And I hear the wind 
Blowing across our beach,
And the surf, 
And I see that our fire 
Has scorched the seaweed."

    "That's the one," Paul said.
    The old woman stared at Paul, then: "Young man, as a Proctor of the Bene Gesserit, I seek the Kwisatz Haderach, the male who truly can become one of us. Your mother sees this possibility in you, but she sees with the eyes of a mother. Possibility I see, too, but no more."
    She fell silent and Paul saw that she wanted him to speak. He waited her out.
    Presently, she said: "As you will, then. You've depths in you; that I'll grant." 
    "May I go now?" he asked.
    "Don't you want to hear what the Reverend Mother can tell you about the Kwisatz Haderach?" Jessica asked. 
    "She said those who tried for it died."
    "But I can help you with a few hints at why they failed," the Reverend Mother said.
    She talks of hints, Paul thought. She doesn't really know anything. And he said: "Hint then."
    "And be damned to me?" She smiled wryly, a crisscross of wrinkles in the old face. "Very well: 'That which submits rules.' " 
    He felt astonishment: she was talking about such elementary things as tension within meaning. Did she think his mother had taught him nothing at all?
    "That's a hint?" he asked.
    "We're not here to bandy words or quibble over their meaning," the old woman said. "The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows -- a wall against the wind. This is the willow's purpose."
    Paul stared at her. She said purpose and he felt the word buffet him, reinfecting him with terrible purpose. He experienced a sudden anger at her: fatuous old witch with her mouth full of platitudes.
    "You think I could be this Kwisatz Haderach," he said. "You talk about me, but you haven't said one thing about what we can do to help my father. I've heard you talking to my mother. You talk as though my father were dead. Well, he isn't!"
    "If there were a thing to be done for him, we'd have done it," the old woman growled. "We may be able to salvage you. Doubtful, but possible. But for your father, nothing. When you've learned to accept that as a fact, you've learned a real Bene Gesserit lesson."
    Paul saw how the words shook his mother. He glared at the old woman. How could she say such a thing about his father? What made her so sure? His mind seethed with resentment.
    The Reverend Mother looked at Jessica. "You've been training him in the Way -- I've seen the signs of it. I'd have done the same in your shoes and devil take the Rules." 
    Jessica nodded.
    "Now, I caution you," said the old woman, "to ignore the regular order of training. His own safety requires the Voice. He already has a good start in it, but we both know how much more he needs . . . and that desperately." She stepped close to Paul, stared down at him. "Goodbye, young human. I hope you make it. But if you don't -- well, we shall yet succeed."
    Once more she looked at Jessica. A flicker sign of understanding passed between them. Then the old woman swept from the room, her robes hissing, with not another backward glance. The room and its occupants already were shut from her thoughts.
    But Jessica had caught one glimpse of the Reverend Mother's face as she turned away. There had been tears on the seamed cheeks. The tears were more unnerving than any other word or sign that had passed between them this day.

You have read that Muad'Dib had no playmates his own age on Caladan. The dangers were too great. But Muad'Dib did have wonderful companion-teachers. There was Gurney Halleck, the troubadour-warrior. You will sing some of Gurney's songs, as you read along in this book. There was Thufir Hawat, the old Mentat Master of Assassins, who struck fear even into the heart of the Padishah Emperor. There were Duncan Idaho, the Swordmaster of the Ginaz; Dr. Wellington Yueh, a name black in treachery but bright in knowledge; the Lady Jessica, who guided her son in the Bene Gesserit Way, and -- of course -- the Duke Leto, whose qualities as a father have long been overlooked.
-from "A Child's History of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    Thufir Hawat slipped into the training room of Castle Caladan, closed the door softly. He stood there a moment, feeling old and tired and storm-leathered. His left leg ached where it had been slashed once in the service of the Old Duke.
    Three generations of them now, he thought.
    He stared across the big room bright with the light of noon pouring through the skylights, saw the boy seated with back to the door, intent on papers and charts spread across an ell table.
    How many times must I tell that lad never to settle himself with his back to a door? Hawat cleared his throat. 
    Paul remained bent over his studies.
    A cloud shadow passed over the skylights. Again, Hawat cleared his throat.
    Paul straightened, spoke without turning: "I know. I'm sitting with my back to a door." 
    Hawat suppressed a smile, strode across the room.
    Paul looked up at the grizzled old man who stopped at a corner of the table. Hawat's eyes were two pools of alertness in a dark and deeply seamed face.
    "I heard you coming down the hall," Paul said. "And I heard you open the door." 
    "The sounds I make could be imitated." 
    "I'd know the difference."
    He might at that, Hawat thought. That witch-mother of his is giving him the deep training, certainly. I wonder what her precious school thinks of that? Maybe that's why they sent the old Proctor here -- to whip our dear Lady Jessica into line.
    Hawat pulled up a chair across from Paul, sat down facing the door. He did it pointedly, leaned back and studied the room. It struck him as an odd place suddenly, a stranger-place with most of its hardware already gone off to Arrakis. A training table remained, and a fencing mirror with its crystal prisms quiescent, the target dummy beside it patched and padded, looking like an ancient foot soldier maimed and battered in the wars. 
    There stand I, Hawat thought.
    "Thufir, what're you thinking?" Paul asked.
    Hawat looked at the boy. "I was thinking we'll all be out of here soon and likely never see the place again." 
    "Does that make you sad?"
    "Sad? Nonsense! Parting with friends is a sadness. A place is only a place." He glanced at the charts on the table. "And Arrakis is just another place." 
    "Did my father send you up to test me?"
    Hawat scowled -- the boy had such observing ways about him. He nodded. "You're thinking it'd have been nicer if he'd come up himself, but you must know how busy he is. He'll be along later." 
    "I've been studying about the storms on Arrakis." 
    "The storms. I see." 
    "They sound pretty bad."
    "That's too cautious a word: bad. Those storms build up across six or seven thousand kilometers of flatlands, feed on anything that can give them a push -- coriolis force, other storms, anything that has an ounce of energy in it. They can blow up to seven hundred kilometers an hour, loaded with everything loose that's in their way -- sand, dust, everything. They can eat flesh off bones and etch the bones to slivers." 
    "Why don't they have weather control?"
    "Arrakis has special problems, costs are higher, and there'd be maintenance and the like. The Guild wants a dreadful high price for satellite control and your father's House isn't one of the big rich ones, lad. You know that." 
    "Have you ever seen the Fremen?" 
    The lad's mind is darting all over today, Hawat thought.
    "Like as not I have seen them," he said. "There's little to tell them from the folk of the graben and sink. They all wear those great flowing robes. And they stink to heaven in any closed space. It's from those suits they wear  -- call them 'stillsuits' -- that reclaim the body's own water."
    Paul swallowed, suddenly aware of the moisture in his mouth, remembering a dream of thirst. That people could want so for water they had to recycle their body moisture struck him with a feeling of desolation. "Water's precious there," he said.
    Hawat nodded, thinking: Perhaps I'm doing it, getting across to him the importance of this planet as an enemy. It's madness to go in there without that caution in our minds.
    Paul looked up at the skylight, aware that it had begun to rain. He saw the spreading wetness on the gray meta-glass. "Water," he said.
    "You'll learn a great concern for water," Hawat said. "As the Duke's son you'll never want for it, but you'll see the pressures of thirst all around you."
    Paul wet his lips with his tongue, thinking back to the day a week ago and the ordeal with the Reverend Mother. She, too, had said something about water starvation.
    "You'll learn about the funeral plains," she'd said, "about the wilderness that is empty, the wasteland where nothing lives except the spice and the sandworms. You'll stain your eyepits to reduce the sun glare. Shelter will mean a hollow out of the wind and hidden from view. You'll ride upon your own two feet without 'thopter or groundcar or mount."
    And Paul had been caught more by her tone -- singsong and wavering -- than by her words.
    "When you live upon Arrakis," she had said, "khala, the land is empty. The moons will be your friends, the sun your enemy." 
    Paul had sensed his mother come up beside him away from her post guarding the door. She had looked at the Reverend Mother and asked: "Do you see no hope. Your Reverence?"
    "Not for the father." And the old woman had waved Jessica to silence, looked down at Paul. "Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things . . . " She held up four big-knuckled fingers. ". . . the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these are as nothing . . . " She closed her fingers into a fist. ". . . without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!"
    A week had passed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words were only now beginning to come into full register. Now, sitting in the training room with Thufir Hawat, Paul felt a sharp pang of fear. He looked across at the Mentat's puzzled frown.
    "Where were you woolgathering that time?" Hawat asked.
    "Did you meet the Reverend Mother?"
    "That Truthsayer witch from the Imperium?" Hawat's eyes quickened with interest. "I met her."
    "She . . . " Paul hesitated, found that he couldn't tell Hawat about the ordeal. The inhibitions went deep. 
    "Yes? What did she?"
    Paul took two deep breaths. "She said a thing." He closed his eyes, calling up the words, and when he spoke his voice unconsciously took on some of the old woman's tone: " 'You, Paul Atreides, descendant of kings, son of a Duke, you must learn to rule. It's something none of your ancestors learned.' " Paul opened his eyes, said: "That made me angry and I said my father rules an entire planet. And she said, 'He's losing it.' And I said my father was getting a richer planet. And she said. 'He'll lose that one, too.' And I wanted to run and warn my father, but she said he'd already been warned -- by you, by Mother, by many people." 
    "True enough," Hawat muttered. 
    "Then why're we going?" Paul demanded.
    "Because the Emperor ordered it. And because there's hope in spite of what that witch-spy said. What else spouted from this ancient fountain of wisdom?"
    Paul looked down at his right hand clenched into a fist beneath the table. Slowly, he willed the muscles to relax. She put some kind of hold on me, he thought. How?
    "She asked me to tell her what it is to rule," Paul said. "And I said that one commands. And she said I had some unlearning to do."
    She hit a mark there right enough, Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to continue.
    "She said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men." 
    "How'd she figure your father attracted men like Duncan and Gurney?" Hawat asked.
    Paul shrugged. "Then she said a good ruler has to learn his world's language, that it's different for every world. And I thought she meant they didn't speak Galach on Arrakis, but she said that wasn't it at all. She said she meant the language of the rocks and growing things, the language you don't hear just with your ears. And I said that's what Dr. Yueh calls the Mystery of Life." 
    Hawat chuckled. "How'd that sit with her?"
    "I think she got mad. She said the mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. So I quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: 'A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.' That seemed to satisfy her."
    He seems to be getting over it, Hawat thought, but that old witch frightened him. Why did she do it?
    "Thufir," Paul said, "will Arrakis be as bad as she said?" 
    "Nothing could be that bad," Hawat said and forced a smile. "Take those Fremen, for example, the renegade people of the desert. By first-approximation analysis, I can tell you there're many, many more of them than the Imperium suspects. People live there, lad: a great many people, and . . ." Hawat put a sinewy finger beside his eye. ". . . they hate Harkonnens with a bloody passion. You must not breathe a word of this, lad. I tell you only as your father's helper."
    "My father has told me of Salusa Secundus," Paul said. "Do you know, Thufir, it sounds much like Arrakis . . . perhaps not quite as bad, but much like it."
    "We do not really know of Salusa Secundus today," Hawat said. "Only what it was like long ago . . . mostly. But what is known -- you're right on that score."
    "Will the Fremen help us?"
    "It's a possibility." Hawat stood up. "I leave today for Arrakis. Meanwhile, you take care of yourself for an old man who's fond of you, heh? Come around here like the good lad and sit facing the door. It's not that I think there's any danger in the castle; it's just a habit I want you to form."
    Paul got to his feet, moved around the table. "You're going today?"
    "Today it is, and you'll be following tomorrow. Next time we meet it'll be on the soil of your new world." He gripped Paul's right arm at the bicep. "Keep your knife arm free, heh? And your shield at full charge." He released the arm, patted Paul's shoulder, whirled and strode quickly to the door. 
    "Thufir! "Paul called.
    Hawat turned, standing in the open doorway. 
    "Don't sit with your back to any doors," Paul said.
    A grin spread across the seamed old face. "That I won't, lad. Depend on it." And he was gone, shutting the door softly behind.
    Paul sat down where Hawat had been, straightened the papers. One more day here, he thought. He looked around the room. We 're leaving. The idea of departure was suddenly more real to him than it had ever been before. He recalled another thing the old woman had said about a world being the sum of many things -- the people, the dirt, the growing things, the moons, the tides, the suns -- the unknown sum called nature, a vague summation without any sense of the now. And he wondered: What is the now?
    The door across from Paul banged open and an ugly lump of a man lurched through it preceded by a handful of weapons.
    "Well, Gurney Halleck," Paul called, "are you the new weapons master?"
    Halleck kicked the door shut with one heel. "You'd rather I came to play games, I know," he said. He glanced abound the room, noting that Hawat's men already had been over it, checking, making it safe for a duke's heir. The subtle code signs were all around.
    Paul watched the rolling, ugly man set himself back in motion, veer toward the training table with the load of weapons, saw the nine-string baliset slung over Gurney's shoulder with the multipick woven through the strings near the head of the fingerboard.
    Halleck dropped the weapons on the exercise table, lined them up -- the rapiers, the bodkins, the kindjals, the slow-pellet stunners, the shield belts. The inkvine scar along his jawline writhed as he turned, casting a smile across the room.
    "So you don't even have a good morning for me, you young imp," Halleck said. "And what barb did you sink in old Hawat? He passed me in the hall like a man running to his enemy's funeral." 
    Paul grinned. Of all his father's men, he liked Gurney Halleck best, knew the man's moods and deviltry, his humors, and thought of him more as a friend than as a hired sword.
    Halleck swung the baliset off his shoulder, began tuning it. "If y' won't talk, y' won't," he said.
    Paul stood, advanced across the room, calling out: "Well, Gurney, do we come prepared for music when it's fighting time?" 
    "So it's sass for our elders today," Halleck said. He tried a chord on the instrument, nodded.
    "Where's Duncan Idaho?" Paul asked. "Isn't he supposed to be teaching me weaponry?"
    "Duncan's gone to lead the second wave onto Arrakis," Halleck said. "All you have left is poor Gurney who's fresh out of fight and spoiling for music." He struck another chord, listened to it, smiled. "And it was decided in council that you being such a poor fighter we'd best teach you the music trade so's you won't waste your life entire."
    "Maybe you'd better sing me a lay then," Paul said. "I want to be sure how not to do it."
    "Ah-h-h, hah!" Gurney laughed, and he swung into "Galacian Girls." his multipick a blur over the strings as he sang:

"Oh-h-h, the Galacian girls 
Will do it for pearls, 
And the Arrakeen for water! 
But if you desire dames 
Like consuming flames, 
Try a Caladanin daughter!"

    "Not bad for such a poor hand with the pick," Paul said, "but if my mother heard you singing a bawdy like that in the castle, she'd have your ears on the outer wall for decoration." 
    Gurney pulled at his left ear. "Poor decoration, too, they having been bruised so much listening at keyholes while a young lad I know practiced some strange ditties on his baliset."
    "So you've forgotten what it's like to find sand in your bed," Paul said. He pulled a shield belt from the table, buckled it fast around his waist. "Then, let's fight!"
    Halleck's eyes went wide in mock surprise. "So! It was your wicked hand did that deed! Guard yourself today, young master -- guard yourself." He grabbed up a rapier, laced the air with it. "I'm a hellfiend out for revenge!"
    Paul lifted the companion rapier, bent it in his hands, stood in the aguile, one foot forward. He let his manner go solemn in a comic imitation of Dr. Yueh.
    "What a dolt my father sends me for weaponry," Paul intoned. "This doltish Gurney Halleck has forgotten the first lesson for a fighting man armed and shielded." Paul snapped the force button at his waist, felt the crinkled-skin tingling of the defensive field at his forehead and down his back, heard external sounds take on characteristic shield-filtered flatness. "In shield fighting, one moves fast on defense, slow on attack," Paul said. "Attack has the sole purpose of tricking the opponent into a misstep, setting him up for the attack sinister. The shield turns the fast blow, admits the slow kindjal!" Paul snapped up the rapier, feinted fast and whipped it back for a slow thrust timed to enter a shield's mindless defenses.
    Halleck watched the action, turned at the last minute to let the blunted blade pass his chest. "Speed, excellent," he said. "But you were wide open for an underhanded counter with a slip-tip." 
    Paul stepped back, chagrined.
    "I should whap your backside for such carelessness," Halleck said. He lifted a naked kindjal from the table and held it up. "This in the hand of an enemy can let out your life's blood! You're an apt pupil, none better, but I've warned you that not even in play do you let a man inside your guard with death in his hand."
    "I guess I'm not in the mood for it today," Paul said.
    "Mood?" Halleck's voice betrayed his outrage even through the shield's filtering. "What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises -- no matter the mood! Mood's a thing for cattle or making love or playing the baliset. It's not for fighting." 
    "I'm sorry, Gurney." 
    "You're not sorry enough!"
    Halleck activated his own shield, crouched with kindjal outthrust in left hand, the rapier poised high in his right. "Now I say guard yourself for true!" He leaped high to one side, then forward, pressing a furious attack.
    Paul fell back, parrying. He felt the field crackling as shield edges touched and repelled each other, sensed the electric tingling of the contact along his skin. What's gotten into Gurney? he asked himself. He's not faking this! Paul moved his left hand, dropped his bodkin into his palm from its wrist sheath.
    "You see a need for an extra blade, eh?" Halleck grunted. 
    Is this betrayal? Paul wondered. Surely not Gurney!
    Around the room they fought -- thrust and parry, feint and counterfeint. The air within their shield bubbles grew stale from the demands on it that the slow interchange along barrier edges could not replenish. With each new shield contact, the smell of ozone grew stronger.
    Paul continued to back, but now he directed his retreat toward the exercise table. If I can turn him beside the table, I'll show him a trick, Paul thought. One more step, Gurney. 
    Halleck took the step.
    Paul directed a parry downward, turned, saw Halleck's rapier catch against the table's edge. Paul flung himself aside, thrust high with rapier and came in across Halleck's neckline with the bodkin. He stopped the blade an inch from the jugular. 
    "Is this what you seek?" Paul whispered. 
    "Look down, lad," Gurney panted.
    Paul obeyed, saw Halleck's kindjal thrust under the table's edge, the tip almost touching Paul's groin.
    "We'd have joined each other in death," Halleck said. "But I'll admit you fought some better when pressed to it. You seemed to get the mood." And he grinned wolfishly, the inkvine scar rippling along his jaw.
    "The way you came at me," Paul said. "Would you really have drawn my blood?"
    Halleck withdrew the kindjal, straightened. "If you'd fought one whit beneath your abilities. I'd have scratched you a good one, a scar you'd remember. I'll not have my favorite pupil fall to the first Harkonnen tramp who happens along."
    Paul deactivated his shield, leaned on the table to catch his breath. "I deserved that, Gurney. But it would've angered my father if you'd hurt me. I'll not have you punished for my failing." 
    "As to that," Halleck said, "it was my failing, too. And you needn't worry about a training scar or two. You're lucky you have so few. As to your father -- the Duke'd punish me only if I failed to make a first-class fighting man out of you. And I'd have been failing there if I hadn't explained the fallacy in this mood thing you've suddenly developed." 
    Paul straightened, slipped his bodkin back into its wrist sheath. 
    "It's not exactly play we do here," Halleck said.
    Paul nodded. He felt a sense of wonder at the uncharacteristic seriousness in Halleck's manner, the sobering intensity. He looked at the beet-colored inkvine scar on the man's jaw, remembering the story of how it had been put there by Beast Rabban in a Harkonnen slave pit on Giedi Prime. And Paul felt a sudden shame that he had doubted Halleck even for an instant. It occurred to Paul, then, that the making of Halleck's scar had been accompanied by pain -- a pain as intense, perhaps, as that inflicted by a Reverend Mother. He thrust this thought aside; it chilled their world.
    "I guess I did hope for some play today," Paul said. "Things are so serious around here lately."
    Halleck turned away to hide his emotions. Something burned in his eyes. There was pain in him -- like a blister, all that was left of some lost yesterday that Time had pruned off him.
    How soon this child must assume his manhood, Halleck thought. How soon he must read that form within his mind, that contract of brutal caution, to enter the necessary fact on the necessary line: "Please list your next of kin."
    Halleck spoke without turning: "I sensed the play in you, lad, and I'd like nothing better than to join in it. But this no longer can be play. Tomorrow we go to Arrakis. Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real." 
    Paul touched his forehead with his rapier blade held vertical.
    Halleck turned, saw the salute and acknowledged it with a nod. He gestured to the practice dummy. "Now, we'll work on your timing. Let me see you catch that thing sinister. I'll control it from over here where I can have a full view of the action. And I warn you I'll be trying new counters today. There's a warning you'd not get from a real enemy."
    Paul stretched up on his toes to relieve his muscles. He felt solemn with the sudden realization that his life had become filled with swift changes. He crossed to the dummy, slapped the switch on its chest with his rapier tip and felt the defensive field forcing his blade away.
    "En garde!" Halleck called, and the dummy pressed the attack. 
    Paul activated his shield, parried and countered.
    Halleck watched as he manipulated the controls. His mind seemed to be in two parts: one alert to the needs of the training fight, and the other wandering in fly-buzz.
    I'm the well-trained fruit tree, he thought. Full of well-trained feelings and abilities and all of them grafted onto me -- all bearing for someone else to pick.
    For some reason, he recalled his younger sister, her elfin face so clear in his mind. But she was dead now -- in a pleasure house for Harkonnen troops. She had loved pansies . . . or was it daisies? He couldn't remember. It bothered him that he couldn't remember.
    Paul countered a slow swing of the dummy, brought up his left hand entretisser.
    That clever little devil! Halleck thought, intent now on Paul's interweaving hand motions. He's been practicing and studying on his own. That's not Duncan's style, and it's certainly nothing I've taught him.
    This thought only added to Halleck's sadness. I'm infected by mood, he thought. And he began to wonder about Paul, if the boy ever listened fearfully to his pillow throbbing in the night. 
    "If wishes were fishes we'd all cast nets," he murmured.
    It was his mother's expression and he always used it when he felt the blackness of tomorrow on him. Then he thought what an odd expression that was to be taking to a planet that had never known seas or fishes.

YUEH (yu'e), Wellington (weling-tun), Stdrd 10,082-10,191; medical doctor of the Suk School (grd Stdrd 10,112); md: Wanna Marcus, B.G. (Stdrd 10,092-10,186?); chiefly noted as betrayer of Duke Leto Atreides. (Cf: Bibliography, Appendix VII [Imperial Conditioning] and Betrayal, The.)
-from "Dictionary of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    Although he heard Dr. Yueh enter the training room, noting the stiff deliberation of the man's pace, Paul remained stretched out face down on the exercise table where the masseuse had left him. He felt deliciously relaxed after the workout with Gurney Halleck.
    "You do look comfortable," said Yueh in his calm, high-pitched voice.
    Paul raised his head, saw the man's stick figure standing several paces away, took in at a glance the wrinkled black clothing, the square block of a head with purple lips and drooping mustache, the diamond tattoo of Imperial Conditioning on his forehead, the long black hair caught in the Suk School's silver ring at the left shoulder.
    "You'll be happy to hear we haven't time for regular lessons today," Yueh said. "Your father will be along presently." 
    Paul sat up.
    "However, I've arranged for you to have a filmbook viewer and several lessons during the crossing to Arrakis." 
    "Oh."
    Paul began pulling on his clothes. He felt excitement that his father would be coming. They had spent so little time together since the Emperor's command to take over the fief of Arrakis.
    Yueh crossed to the ell table, thinking: How the boy has filled out these past few months. Such a waste! Oh, such a sad waste. And he reminded himself: I must not falter. What I do is done to be certain my Wanna no longer can be hurt by the Harkonnen beasts.
    Paul joined him at the table, buttoning his jacket. "What'll I be studying on the way across?"
    "Ah-h-h-h, the terranic life forms of Arrakis. The planet seems to have opened its arms to certain terranic life forms. It's not clear how. I must seek out the planetary ecologist when we arrive -- a Dr. Kynes -- and offer my help in the investigation."
    And Yueh thought: What am I saying? I play the hypocrite even with myself.
    "Will there be something on the Fremen?" Paul asked.
    "The Fremen?" Yueh drummed his fingers on the table, caught Paul staring at the nervous motion, withdrew his hand.
    "Maybe you have something on the whole Arrakeen population," Paul said.
    "Yes, to be sure," Yueh said. "There are two general separations of the people -- Fremen, they are one group, and the others are the people of the graben, the sink, and the pan. There's some intermarriage, I'm told. The women of pan and sink villages prefer Fremen husbands; their men prefer Fremen wives. They have a saying: 'Polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the desert.' "
    "Do you have pictures of them?"
    "I'll see what I can get you. The most interesting feature, of course, is their eyes -- totally blue, no whites in them." 
    "Mutation?" 
    "No; it's linked to saturation of the blood with melange." 
    "The Fremen must be brave to live at the edge of that desert." 
    "By all accounts," Yueh said. "They compose poems to their knives. Their women are as fierce as the men. Even Fremen children are violent and dangerous. You'll not be permitted to mingle with them, I daresay."
    Paul stared at Yueh, finding in these few glimpses of the Fremen a power of words that caught his entire attention. What a people to win as allies!
    "And the worms?" Paul asked. 
    "What?" 
    "I'd like to study more about the sandworms." 
    "Ah-h-h-h, to be sure. I've a filmbook on a small specimen, only one hundred and ten meters long and twenty-two meters in diameter. It was taken in the northern latitudes. Worms of more than four hundred meters in length have been recorded by reliable witnesses, and there's reason to believe even larger ones exist." 
    Paul glanced down at a conical projection chart of the northern Arrakeen latitudes spread on the table. "The desert belt and south polar regions are marked uninhabitable. Is it the worms?" 
    "And the storms." 
    "But any place can be made habitable."
    "If it's economically feasible," Yueh said. "Arrakis has many costly perils." He smoothed his drooping mustache. "Your father will be here soon. Before I go, I've a gift for you, something I came across in packing." He put an object on the table between them -- black, oblong, no larger than the end of Paul's thumb.
    Paul looked at it. Yueh noted how the boy did not reach for it, and thought: How cautious he is.
    "It's a very old Orange Catholic Bible made for space travelers. Not a filmbook, but actually printed on filament paper. It has its own magnifier and electrostatic charge system." He picked it up, demonstrated. "The book is held closed by the charge, which forces against spring-locked covers. You press the edge -- thus, and the pages you've selected repel each other and the book opens." 
    "It's so small."
    "But it has eighteen hundred pages. You press the edge -- thus, and so . . . and the charge moves ahead one page at a time as you read. Never touch the actual pages with your fingers. The filament tissue is too delicate." He closed the book, handed it to Paul. "Try it."
    Yueh watched Paul work the page adjustment, thought: I salve my own conscience. I give him the surcease of religion before betraying him. Thus may I say to myself that he has gone where I cannot go.
    "This must've been made before filmbooks," Paul said.
    "It's quite old. Let it be our secret, eh? Your parents might think it too valuable for one so young."
    And Yueh thought: His mother would surely wonder at my motives.
    "Well . . . " Paul closed the book, held it in his hand. "If it's so valuable . . . "
    "Indulge an old man's whim," Yueh said. "It was given to me when I was very young." And he thought: I must catch his mind as well as his cupidity. "Open it to four-sixty-seven Kalima -- where it says: 'From water does all life begin.' There's a slight notch on the edge of the cover to mark the place."
    Paul felt the cover, detected two notches, one shallower than the other. He pressed the shallower one and the book spread open on his palm, its magnifier sliding into place. 
    "Read it aloud," Yueh said.
    Paul wet his lips with his tongue, read: "Think you of the fact that a deaf person cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess? What senses do we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all around us? What is there around us that we cannot --" 
    "Stop it!" Yueh barked. 
    Paul broke off, stared at him.
    Yueh closed his eyes, fought to regain composure. What perversity caused the book to open at my Wanna's favorite passage? He opened his eyes, saw Paul staring at him.
    "Is something wrong?" Paul asked.
    "I'm sorry," Yueh said. "That was . . . my . . . dead wife's favorite passage. It's not the one I intended you to read. It brings up memories that are . . . painful." 
    "There are two notches," Paul said.
    Of course, Yueh thought. Wanna marked her passage. His fingers are more sensitive than mine and found her mark. It was an accident, no more.
    "You may find the book interesting," Yueh said. "It has much historical truth in it as well as good ethical philosophy." 
    Paul looked down at the tiny book in his palm -- such a small thing. Yet, it contained a mystery . . . something had happened while he read from it. He had felt something stir his terrible purpose.
    "Your father will be here any minute," Yueh said. "Put the book away and read it at your leisure."
    Paul touched the edge of it as Yueh had shown him. The book sealed itself. He slipped it into his tunic. For a moment there when Yueh had barked at him, Paul had feared the man would demand the book's return.
    "I thank you for the gift. Dr. Yueh," Paul said, speaking formally. "It will be our secret. If there is a gift of favor you wish from me, please do not hesitate to ask." 
    "I . . . need for nothing," Yueh said.
    And he thought: Why do I stand here torturing myself? And torturing this poor lad . . . though he does not know it. Oeyh! Damn those Harkonnen beasts! Why did they choose me for their abomination?

How do we approach the study of Muad'Dib's father? A man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there -- a man snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?
-from "Muad'Dib, Family Commentaries" by the Princess Irulan

    Paul watched his father enter the training room, saw the guards take up stations outside. One of them closed the door. As always, Paul experienced a sense of presence in his father, someone totally here.
    The Duke was tall, olive-skinned. His thin face held harsh angles warmed only by deep gray eyes. He wore a black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast. A silvered shield belt with the patina of much use girded his narrow waist.
    The Duke said: "Hard at work, Son?"
    He crossed to the ell table, glanced at the papers on it, swept his gaze around the room and back to Paul. He felt tired, filled with the ache of not showing his fatigue. I must use every opportunity to rest during the crossing to Arrakis, he thought. There'll be no rest on Arrakis.
    "Not very hard," Paul said. "Everything's so . . . " He shrugged.
    "Yes. Well, tomorrow we leave. It'll be good to get settled in our new home, put all this upset behind."
    Paul nodded, suddenly overcome by memory of the Reverend Mother's words: " . . . for the father, nothing."
    "Father," Paul said, "will Arrakis be as dangerous as everyone says?"
    The Duke forced himself to the casual gesture, sat down on a corner of the table, smiled. A whole pattern of conversation welled up in his mind -- the kind of thing he might use to dispel the vapors in his men before a battle. The pattern froze before it could be vocalized, confronted by the single thought: 
    This is my son.
    "It'll be dangerous," he admitted.
    "Hawat tells me we have a plan for the Fremen," Paul said. And he wondered: Why don't I tell him what that old woman said? How did she seal my tongue?
    The Duke noted his son's distress, said: "As always, Hawat sees the main chance. But there's much more. I see also the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles -- the CHOAM Company. By giving me Arrakis, His Majesty is forced to give us a CHOAM directorship . . . a subtle gain." 
    "CHOAM controls the spice," Paul said.
    "And Arrakis with its spice is our avenue into CHOAM," the Duke said. "There's more to CHOAM than melange." 
    "Did the Reverend Mother warn you?" Paul blurted. He clenched his fists, feeling his palms slippery with perspiration. The effort it had taken to ask that question.
    "Hawat tells me she frightened you with warnings about Arrakis," the Duke said. "Don't let a woman's fears cloud your mind. No woman wants her loved ones endangered. The hand behind those warnings was your mother's. Take this as a sign of her love for us." 
    "Does she know about the Fremen?" 
    "Yes, and about much more." 
    "What?"
    And the Duke thought: The truth could be worse than he imagines, but even dangerous facts are valuable if you've been trained to deal with them. And there's one place where nothing has been spared for my son -- dealing with dangerous facts. This must be leavened, though; he is young.
    "Few products escape the CHOAM touch," the Duke said. "Logs, donkeys, horses, cows, lumber, dung, sharks, whale fur -- the most prosaic and the most exotic . . . even our poor pundi rice from Caladan. Anything the Guild will transport, the art forms of Ecaz, the machines of Richesse and Ix. But all fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties." 
    "And now we control it?"
    "To a certain degree. But the important thing is to consider all the Houses that depend on CHOAM profits. And think of the enormous proportion of those profits dependent upon a single product -- the spice. Imagine what would happen if something should reduce spice production."
    "Whoever had stockpiled melange could make a killing," Paul said. "Others would be out in the cold."
    The Duke permitted himself a moment of grim satisfaction, looking at his son and thinking how penetrating, how truly educated that observation had been. He nodded. "The Harkonnens have been stockpiling for more than twenty years." 
    "They mean spice production to fail and you to be blamed."
    "They wish the Atreides name to become unpopular," the Duke said. "Think of the Landsraad Houses that look to me for a certain amount of leadership -- their unofficial spokesman. Think how they'd react if I were responsible for a serious reduction in their income. After all, one's own profits come first. The Great Convention be damned! You can't let someone pauperize you!" A harsh smile twisted the Duke's mouth. "They'd look the other way no matter what was done to me." 
    "Even if we were attacked with atomics?"
    "Nothing that flagrant. No open defiance of the Convention. But almost anything else short of that . . . perhaps even dusting and a bit of soil poisoning." 
    "Then why are we walking into this?"
    "Paul!" The Duke frowned at his son. "Knowing where the trap is -- that's the first step in evading it. This is like single combat, Son, only on a larger scale -- a feint within a feint within a feint . . . seemingly without end. The task is to unravel it. Knowing that the Harkonnens stockpile melange, we ask another question: Who else is stockpiling? That's the list of our enemies." 
    "Who?"
    "Certain Houses we knew were unfriendly and some we'd thought friendly. We need not consider them for the moment because there is one other much more important: our beloved Padishah Emperor."
    Paul tried to swallow in a throat suddenly dry. "Couldn't you convene the Landsraad, expose --"
    "Make our enemy aware we know which hand holds the knife? Ah, now, Paul -- we see the knife, now. Who knows where it might be shifted next? If we put this before the Landsraad it'd only create a great cloud of confusion. The Emperor would deny it. Who could gainsay him? All we'd gain is a little time while risking chaos. And where would the next attack come from?" 
    "All the Houses might start stockpiling spice." 
    "Our enemies have a head start -- too much of a lead to overcome." 
    "The Emperor," Paul said. "That means the Sardaukar." 
    "Disguised in Harkonnen livery, no doubt," the Duke said. "But the soldier fanatics nonetheless." 
    "How can Fremen help us against Sardaukar?" 
    "Did Hawat talk to you about Salusa Secundus?" 
    "The Emperor's prison planet? No."
    "What if it were more than a prison planet, Paul? There's a question you never hear asked about the Imperial Corps of Sardaukar: Where do they come from?" 
    "From the prison planet?" 
    "They come from somewhere." 
    "But the supporting levies the Emperor demands from --" 
    "That's what we're led to believe: they're just the Emperor's levies trained young and superbly. You hear an occasional muttering about the Emperor's training cadres, but the balance of our civilization remains the same: the military forces of the Landsraad Great Houses on one side, the Sardaukar and their supporting levies on the other. And their supporting levies, Paul. The Sardaukar remain the Sardaukar." 
    "But every report on Salusa Secundus says S.S. is a hell world!" 
    "Undoubtedly. But if you were going to raise tough, strong, ferocious men, what environmental conditions would you impose on them?"
    "How could you win the loyalty of such men?" 
    "There are proven ways: play on the certain knowledge of their superiority, the mystique of secret covenant, the esprit of shared suffering. It can be done. It has been done on many worlds in many times."
    Paul nodded, holding his attention on his father's face. He felt some revelation impending.
    "Consider Arrakis," the Duke said. "When you get outside the towns and garrison villages, it's every bit as terrible a place as Salusa Secundus." 
    Paul's eyes went wide. "The Fremen!"
    "We have there the potential of a corps as strong and deadly as the Sardaukar. It'll require patience to exploit them secretly and wealth to equip them properly. But the Fremen are there . . . and the spice wealth is there. You see now why we walk into Arrakis, knowing the trap is there." 
    "Don't the Harkonnens know about the Fremen?" 
    "The Harkonnens sneered at the Fremen, hunted them for sport, never even bothered trying to count them. We know the Harkonnen policy with planetary populations -- spend as little as possible to maintain them."
    The metallic threads in the hawk symbol above his father's breast glistened as the Duke shifted his position. "You see?" 
    "We're negotiating with the Fremen right now," Paul said.
    "I sent a mission headed by Duncan Idaho," the Duke said. "A proud and ruthless man, Duncan, but fond of the truth. I think the Fremen will admire him. If we're lucky, they may judge us by him: Duncan, the moral." 
    "Duncan, the moral," Paul said, "and Gurney the valorous." 
    "You name them well," the Duke said.
    And Paul thought: Gurney's one of those the Reverend Mother meant, a supporter of worlds -- " . . . the valor of the brave." 
    "Gurney tells me you did well in weapons today," the Duke said.
    "That isn't what he told me."
    The Duke laughed aloud. "I figured Gurney to be sparse with his praise. He says you have a nicety of awareness -- in his own words -- of the difference between a blade's edge and its tip." 
    "Gurney says there's no artistry in killing with the tip, that it should be done with the edge."
    "Gurney's a romantic," the Duke growled. This talk of killing suddenly disturbed him, coming from his son. "I'd sooner you never had to kill . . . but if the need arises, you do it however you can -- tip or edge." He looked up at the skylight, on which the rain was drumming.
    Seeing the direction of his father's stare, Paul thought of the wet skies out there -- a thing never to be seen on Arrakis from all accounts -- and this thought of skies put him in mind of the space beyond. "Are the Guild ships really big?" he asked.
    The Duke looked at him. "This will be your first time off planet," he said. "Yes, they're big. We'll be riding a Heighliner because it's a long trip. A Heighliner is truly big. Its hold will tuck all our frigates and transports into a little corner -- we'll be just a small part of the ship's manifest." 
    "And we won't be able to leave our frigates?" 
    "That's part of the price you pay for Guild Security. There could be Harkonnen ships right alongside us and we'd have nothing to fear from them. The Harkonnens know better than to endanger their shipping privileges." 
    "I'm going to watch our screens and try to see a Guildsman." 
    "You won't. Not even their agents ever see a Guildsman. The Guild's as jealous of its privacy as it is of its monopoly. Don't do anything to endanger our shipping privileges, Paul." 
    "Do you think they hide because they've mutated and don't look . . . human anymore?"
    "Who knows?" The Duke shrugged. "It's a mystery we're not likely to solve. We've more immediate problems -- among them: you." 
    "Me?"
    "Your mother wanted me to be the one to tell you, Son. You see, you may have Mentat capabilities."
    Paul stared at his father, unable to speak for a moment, then: "A Mentat? Me? But I . . . " 
    "Hawat agrees, Son. It's true."
    "But I thought Mentat training had to start during infancy and the subject couldn't be told because it might inhibit the early . . . " He broke off, all his past circumstances coming to focus in one flashing computation. "I see," he said.
    "A day comes," the Duke said, "when the potential Mentat must learn what's being done. It may no longer be done to him. The Mentat has to share in the choice of whether to continue or abandon the training. Some can continue; some are incapable of it. Only the potential Mentat can tell this for sure about himself." 
    Paul rubbed his chin. All the special training from Hawat and his mother -- the mnemonics, the focusing of awareness, the muscle control and sharpening of sensitivities, the study of languages and nuances of voices -- all of it clicked into a new kind of understanding in his mind.
    "You'll be the Duke someday, Son," his father said. "A Mentat Duke would be formidable indeed. Can you decide now . . . or do you need more time?"
    There was no hesitation in his answer. "I'll go on with the training."
    "Formidable indeed," the Duke murmured, and Paul saw the proud smile on his father's face. The smile shocked Paul: it had a skull look on the Duke's narrow features. Paul closed his eyes, feeling the terrible purpose reawaken within him. Perhaps being a Mentat is terrible purpose, he thought.
    But even as he focused on this thought, his new awareness denied it.

With the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing implant-legends through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition. The wisdom of seeding the known universe with a prophecy pattern for the protection of B.G. personnel has long been appreciated, but never have we seen a condition-ut-extremis with more ideal mating of person and preparation. The prophetic legends had taken on Arrakis even to the extent of adopted labels (including Reverend Mother, canto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a panoplia propheticus). And it is generally accepted now that the Lady Jessica's latent abilities were grossly underestimated.
-from "Analysis: The Arrakeen Crisis" by the Princess Irulan [Private circulation: B.G. file number AR-81088587]

    All around the Lady Jessica -- piled in corners of the Arrakeen great hall, mounded in the open spaces -- stood the packaged freight of their lives: boxes, trunks, cartons, cases -- some partly unpacked. She could hear the cargo handlers from the Guild shuttle depositing another load in the entry.
    Jessica stood in the center of the hall. She moved in a slow turn, looking up and around at shadowed carvings, crannies and deeply recessed windows. This giant anachronism of a room reminded her of the Sisters' Hall at her Bene Gesserit school. But at the school the effect had been of warmth. Here, all was bleak stone.
    Some architect had reached far back into history for these buttressed walls and dark hangings, she thought. The arched ceiling stood two stories above her with great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped here to Arrakis across space at monstrous cost. No planet of this system grew trees to make such beams -- unless the beams were imitation wood. 
    She thought not.
    This had been the government mansion in the days of the Old Empire. Costs had been of less importance then. It had been before the Harkonnens and their new megalopolis of Carthag -- a cheap and brassy place some two hundred kilometers northeast across the Broken Land. Leto had been wise to choose this place for his seat of government. The name, Arrakeen, had a good sound, filled with tradition. And this was a smaller city, easier to sterilize and defend.
    Again there came the clatter of boxes being unloaded in the entry. Jessica sighed.
    Against a carton to her right stood the painting of the Duke's father. Wrapping twine hung from it like a frayed decoration. A piece of the twine was still clutched in Jessica's left hand. Beside the painting lay a black bull's head mounted on a polished board. The head was a dark island in a sea of wadded paper. Its plaque lay flat on the floor, and the bull's shiny muzzle pointed at the ceiling as though the beast were ready to bellow a challenge into this echoing room.
    Jessica wondered what compulsion had brought her to uncover those two things first -- the head and the painting. She knew there was something symbolic in the action. Not since the day when the Duke's buyers had taken her from the school had she felt this frightened and unsure of herself. 
    The head and the picture.
    They heightened her feelings of confusion. She shuddered, glanced at the slit windows high overhead. It was still early afternoon here, and in these latitudes the sky looked black and cold -- so much darker than the warm blue of Caladan. A pang of homesickness throbbed through her. 
    So far away, Caladan. 
    "Here we are!"
    The voice was Duke Leto's.
    She whirled, saw him striding from the arched passage to the dining hall. His black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast looked dusty and rumpled.
    "I thought you might have lost yourself in this hideous place," he said.
    "It is a cold house," she said. She looked at his tallness, at the dark skin that made her think of olive groves and golden sun on blue waters. There was woodsmoke in the gray of his eyes, but the face was predatory: thin, full of sharp angles and planes.
    A sudden fear of him tightened her breast. He had become such a savage, driving person since the decision to bow to the Emperor's command.
    "The whole city feels cold," she said.
    "It's a dirty, dusty little garrison town," he agreed. "But we'll change that." He looked around the hall. "These are public rooms for state occasions. I've just glanced at some of the family apartments in the south wing. They're much nicer." He stepped closer, touched her arm, admiring her stateliness.
    And again, he wondered at her unknown ancestry -- a renegade House, perhaps? Some black-barred royalty? She looked more regal than the Emperor's own blood.
    Under the pressure of his stare, she turned half away, exposing her profile. And he realized there was no single and precise thing that brought her beauty to focus. The face was oval under a cap of hair the color of polished bronze. Her eyes were set wide, as green and clear as the morning skies of Caladan. The nose was small, the mouth wide and generous. Her figure was good but scant: tall and with its curves gone to slimness.
    He remembered that the lay sisters at the school had called her skinny, so his buyers had told him. But that description oversimplified. She had brought a regal beauty back into the Atreides line. He was glad that Paul favored her. 
    "Where's Paul?" he asked.
    "Someplace around the house taking his lessons with Yueh." 
    "Probably in the south wing," he said. "I thought I heard Yueh's voice, but I couldn't take time to look." He glanced down at her, hesitating. "I came here only to hang the key of Caladan Castle in the dining hall."
    She caught her breath, stopped the impulse to reach out to him. Hanging the key -- there was finality in that action. But this was not the time or place for comforting. "I saw our banner over the house as we came in," she said.
    He glanced at the painting of his father. "Where were you going to hang that?" 
    "Somewhere in here."
    "No." The word rang flat and final, telling her she could use trickery to persuade, but open argument was useless. Still, she had to try, even if the gesture served only to remind herself that she would not trick him.
    "My Lord," she said, "if you'd only . . . "
    "The answer remains no. I indulge you shamefully in most things, not in this. I've just come from the dining hall where there are --" 
    "My Lord! Please."
    "The choice is between your digestion and my ancestral dignity, my dear," he said. "They will hang in the dining hall." 
    She sighed. "Yes, my Lord."
    "You may resume your custom of dining in your rooms whenever possible. I shall expect you at your proper position only on formal occasions." 
    "Thank you, my Lord."
    "And don't go all cold and formal on me! Be thankful that I never married you, my dear. Then it'd be your duty to join me at table for every meal." 
    She held her face immobile, nodded.
    "Hawat already has our own poison snooper over the dining table," he said. "There's a portable in your room." 
    "You anticipated this . . . disagreement," she said.
    "My dear, I think also of your comfort. I've engaged servants. They're locals, but Hawat has cleared them -- they're Fremen all. They'll do until our own people can be released from their other duties." 
    "Can anyone from this place be truly safe?"
    "Anyone who hates Harkonnens. You may even want to keep the head housekeeper: the Shadout Mapes." 
    "Shadout," Jessica said. "A Fremen title?"
    "I'm told it means 'well-dipper,' a meaning with rather important overtones here. She may not strike you as a servant type, although Hawat speaks highly of her on the basis of Duncan's report. They're convinced she wants to serve -- specifically that she wants to serve you." 
    "Me?"
    "The Fremen have learned that you're Bene Gesserit," he said. "There are legends here about the Bene Gesserit."
    The Missionaria Protectiva, Jessica thought. No place escapes them.
    "Does this mean Duncan was successful?" she asked. "Will the Fremen be our allies?"
    "There's nothing definite," he said. "They wish to observe us for a while, Duncan believes. They did, however, promise to stop raiding our outlying villages during a truce period. That's a more important gain than it might seem. Hawat tells me the Fremen were a deep thorn in the Harkonnen side, that the extent of their ravages was a carefully guarded secret. It wouldn't have helped for the Emperor to learn the ineffectiveness of the Harkonnen military." 
    "A Fremen housekeeper," Jessica mused, returning to the subject of the Shadout Mapes. "She'll have the all-blue eyes." 
    "Don't let the appearance of these people deceive you," he said. "There's a deep strength and healthy vitality in them. I think they'll be everything we need." 
    "It's a dangerous gamble," she said. 
    "Let's not go into that again," he said.
    She forced a smile. "We are committed, no doubt of that." She went through the quick regimen of calmness -- the two deep breaths, the ritual thought, then: "When I assign rooms, is there anything special I should reserve for you?"
    "You must teach me someday how you do that," he said, "the way you thrust your worries aside and turn to practical matters. It must be a Bene Gesserit thing." 
    "It's a female thing," she said.
    He smiled. "Well, assignment of rooms: make certain, I have large office space next my sleeping quarters. There'll be more paper work here than on Caladan. A guard room, of course. That should cover it. Don't worry about security of the house. Hawat's men have been over it in depth." 
    "I'm sure they have."
    He glanced at his wristwatch. "And you might see that all our timepieces are adjusted for Arrakeen local. I've assigned a tech to take care of it. He'll be along presently." He brushed a strand of her hair back from her forehead. "I must return to the landing field now. The second shuttle's due any minute with my staff reserves." 
    "Couldn't Hawat meet them, my Lord? You look so tired." 
    "The good Thufir is even busier than I am. You know this planet's infested with Harkonnen intrigues. Besides, I must try persuading some of the trained spice hunters against leaving. They have the option, you know, with the change of fief -- and this planetologist the Emperor and the Landsraad installed as Judge of the Change cannot be bought. He's allowing the opt. About eight hundred trained hands expect to go out on the spice shuttle and there's a Guild cargo ship standing by." 
    "My Lord . . . " She broke off, hesitating. 
    "Yes?"
    He will not be persuaded against trying to make this planet secure for us, she thought. And I cannot use my tricks on him. 
    "At what time will you be expecting dinner?" she asked.
    That's not what she was going to say, he thought. Ah-h-h-h, my Jessica, would that we were somewhere else, anywhere away from this terrible place -- alone, the two of us, without a care.
    "I'll eat in the officers' mess at the field," he said. "Don't expect me until very late. And . . .ah, I'll be sending a guardcar for Paul. I want him to attend our strategy conference." 
    He cleared his throat as though to say something else, then, without warning, turned and strode out, headed for the entry where she could hear more boxes being deposited. His voice sounded once from there, commanding and disdainful, the way he always spoke to servants when he was in a hurry: "The Lady Jessica's in the Great Hall. Join her there immediately." 
    The outer door slammed.
    Jessica turned away, faced the painting of Leto's father. It had been done by the famed artist, Albe, during the Old Duke's middle years. He was portrayed in matador costume with a magenta cape flung over his left arm. The face looked young, hardly older than Leto's now, and with the same hawk features, the same gray stare. She clenched her fists at her sides, glared at the painting. 
    "Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!" she whispered. 
    "What are your orders, Noble Born?" 
    It was a woman's voice, thin and stringy.
    Jessica whirled, stared down at a knobby, gray-haired woman in a shapeless sack dress of bondsman brown. The woman looked as wrinkled and desiccated as any member of the mob that had greeted them along the way from the landing field that morning. Every native she had seen on this planet, Jessica thought, looked prune dry and undernourished. Yet, Leto had said they were strong and vital. And there were the eyes, of course -- that wash of deepest, darkest blue without any white -- secretive, mysterious. Jessica forced herself not to stare.
    The woman gave a stiff-necked nod, said: "I am called the Shadout Mapes, Noble Born. What are your orders?"
    "You may refer to me as 'my Lady,' " Jessica said. "I'm not noble born. I'm the bound concubine of the Duke Leto." 
    Again that strange nod, and the woman peered upward at Jessica with a sly questioning, "There's a wife, then?"
    "There is not, nor has there ever been. I am the Duke's only . . . companion, the mother of his heir-designate."
    Even as she spoke, Jessica laughed inwardly at the pride behind her words. What was it St. Augustine said? she asked herself. "The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance." Yes -- I am meeting more resistance lately. I could use a quiet retreat by myself.
    A weird cry sounded from the road outside the house. It was repeated: "Soo-soo-Sook! Soo-soo-Sook!" Then: "Ikhut-eigh! Ikhut-eigh!" And again: "Soo-soo-Sook!"
    "What is that?" Jessica asked. "I heard it several times as we drove through the streets this morning."
    "Only a water-seller, my Lady. But you've no need to interest yourself in such as they. The cistern here holds fifty thousand liters and it's always kept full." She glanced down at her dress. "Why, you know, my Lady, I don't even have to wear my stillsuit here?" She cackled. "And me not even dead!"
    Jessica hesitated, wanting to question this Fremen woman, needing data to guide her. But bringing order of the confusion in the castle was more imperative. Still, she found the thought unsettling that water was a major mark of wealth here.
    "My husband told me of your title, Shadout," Jessica said. "I recognized the word. It's a very ancient word."
    "You know the ancient tongues then?" Mapes asked, and she waited with an odd intensity.
    "Tongues are the Bene Gesserit's first learning," Jessica said. "I know the Bhotani Jib and the Chakobsa, all the hunting languages." 
    Mapes nodded. "Just as the legend says."
    And Jessica wondered: Why do I play out this sham? But the Bene Gesserit ways were devious and compelling.
    "I know the Dark Things and the ways of the Great Mother," Jessica said. She read the more obvious signs in Mapes' actions and appearance, the petit betrayals. "Miseces prejia," she said in the Chakobsa tongue. "Andral t're pera! Trada cik buscakri miseces perakri --" 
    Mapes took a backward step, appeared poised to flee. 
    "I know many things." Jessica said. "I know that you have borne children, that you have lost loved ones, that you have hidden in fear and that you have done violence and will yet do more violence. I know many things." 
    In a low voice, Mapes said: "I meant no offense, my Lady." 
    "You speak of the legend and seek answers," Jessica said. "Beware the answers you may find. I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice." 
    "My Lady, I . . . "
    "There's a remote possibility you could draw my life's blood," Jessica said, "but in so doing you'd bring down more ruin than your wildest fears could imagine. There are worse things than dying, you know -- even for an entire people."
    "My Lady!" Mapes pleaded. She appeared about to fall to her knees. "The weapon was sent as a gift to you should you prove to be the One."
    "And as the means of my death should I prove otherwise," Jessica said. She waited in the seeming relaxation that made the Bene Gesserit-trained so terrifying in combat. 
    Now we see which way the decision tips, she thought.
    Slowly, Mapes reached into the neck of her dress, brought out a dark sheath. A black handle with deep finger ridges protruded from it. She took sheath in one hand and handle in the other, withdrew a milk-white blade, held it up. The blade seemed to shine and glitter with a light of its own. It was double-edged like a kindjal and the blade was perhaps twenty centimeters long. 
    "Do you know this, my Lady?" Mapes asked.
    It could only be one thing, Jessica knew, the fabled crysknife of Arrakis, the blade that had never been taken off the planet, and was known only by rumor and wild gossip. 
    "It's a crysknife," she said.
    "Say it not lightly," Mapes said. "Do you know its meaning?" 
    And Jessica thought: There was an edge to that question. Here's the reason this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. My answer could precipitate violence or . . . what? She seeks an answer from me: the meaning of a knife. She's called the Shadow in the Chakobsa tongue. Knife, that's "Death Maker" in Chakobsa. She's getting restive. I must answer now. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. 
    Jessica said: "It's a maker --"
    "Eighe-e-e-e-e-e!" Mapes wailed. It was a sound of both grief and elation. She trembled so hard the knife blade sent glittering shards of reflection shooting around the room.
    Jessica waited, poised. She had intended to say the knife was a maker of death and then add the ancient word, but every sense warned her now, all the deep training of alertness that exposed meaning in the most casual muscle twitch. 
    The key word was . . . maker.
    Maker? Maker.
    Still, Mapes held the knife as though ready to use it.
    Jessica said: "Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the Maker?"
    Mapes lowered the knife. "My Lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock." 
    Jessica thought about the prophecy -- the Shari-a and all the panoplia propheticus, a Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva dropped here long centuries ago -- long dead, no doubt, but her purpose accomplished: the protective legends implanted in these people against the day of a Bene Gesserit's need. 
    Well, that day had come.
    Mapes returned knife to sheath, said: "This is an unfixed blade, my Lady. Keep it near you. More than a week away from flesh and it begins to disintegrate. It's yours, a tooth of shai-hulud, for as long as you live."
    Jessica reached out her right hand, risked a gamble: "Mapes, you've sheathed that blade unblooded."
    With a gasp, Mapes dropped the sheathed knife into Jessica's hand, tore open the brown bodice, wailing: "Take the water of my life!"
    Jessica withdrew the blade from its sheath. How it glittered! She directed the point toward Mapes, saw a fear greater than death-panic come over the woman. Poison in the point? Jessica wondered. She tipped up the point, drew a delicate scratch with the blade's edge above Mapes' left breast. There was a thick welling of blood that stopped almost immediately. Ultrafast coagulation, Jessica thought. A moisture-conserving mutation?
    She sheathed the blade, said: "Button your dress, Mapes." 
    Mapes obeyed, trembling. The eyes without whites stared at Jessica. "You are ours," she muttered. "You are the One." 
    There came another sound of unloading in the entry. Swiftly, Mapes grabbed the sheathed knife, concealed it in Jessica's bodice. "Who sees that knife must be cleansed or slain!" she snarled. "You know that, my Lady!" 
    I know it now, Jessica thought.
    The cargo handlers left without intruding on the Great Hall.
    Mapes composed herself, said: "The uncleansed who have seen a crysknife may not leave Arrakis alive. Never forget that, my Lady. You've been entrusted with a crysknife." She took a deep breath. "Now the thing must take its course. It cannot be hurried." She glanced at the stacked boxes and piled goods around them. "And there's work aplenty to while the time for us here." 
    Jessica hesitated. "The thing must take its course." That was a specific catchphrase from the Missionaria Protectiva's stock of incantations -- The coming of the Reverend Mother to free you.
    But I'm not a Reverend Mother, Jessica thought. And then: Great Mother! They planted that one here! This must be a hideous place!
    In matter-of-fact tones, Mapes said: "What'll you be wanting me to do first, my Lady?"
    Instinct warned Jessica to match that casual tone. She said: "The painting of the Old Duke over there, it must be hung on one side of the dining hall. The bull's head must go on the wall opposite the painting."
    Mapes crossed to the bull's head. "What a great beast it must have been to carry such a head," she said. She stooped. "I'll have to be cleaning this first, won't I, my Lady?" 
    "No." 
    "But there's dirt caked on its horns."
    "That's not dirt, Mapes. That's the blood of our Duke's father. Those horns were sprayed with a transparent fixative within hours after this beast killed the Old Duke." 
    Mapes stood up. "Ah, now!" she said.
    "It's just blood," Jessica said. "Old blood at that. Get some help hanging these now. The beastly things are heavy."
    "Did you think the blood bothered me?" Mapes asked. "I'm of the desert and I've seen blood aplenty." 
    "I . . . see that you have," Jessica said.
    "And some of it my own," Mapes said. "More'n you drew with your puny scratch." 
    "You'd rather I'd cut deeper?"
    "Ah, no! The body's water is scant enough 'thout gushing a wasteful lot of it into the air. You did the thing right." 
    And Jessica, noting the words and manner, caught the deeper implications in the phrase, 'the body's water.' Again she felt a sense of oppression at the importance of water on Arrakis.
    "On which side of the dining hall shall I hang which one of these pretties, my Lady?" Mapes asked.
    Ever the practical one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. She said: "Use your own judgment, Mapes. It makes no real difference." 
    "As you say, my Lady." Mapes stooped, began clearing wrappings and twine from the head. "Killed an old duke, did you?" she crooned.
    "Shall I summon a handler to help you?" Jessica asked. 
    "I'll manage, my Lady."
    Yes, she'll manage, Jessica thought. There's that about this Fremen creature: the drive to manage.
    Jessica felt the cold sheath of the crysknife beneath her bodice, thought of the long chain of Bene Gesserit scheming that had forged another link here. Because of that scheming, she had survived a deadly crisis. "It cannot be hurried," Mapes had said. Yet there was a tempo of headlong rushing to this place that filled Jessica with foreboding. And not all the preparations of the Missionaria Protectiva nor Hawat's suspicious inspection of this castellated pile of rocks could dispel the feeling.
    "When you've finished hanging those, start unpacking the boxes," Jessica said. "One of the cargo men at the entry has all the keys and knows where things should go. Get the keys and the list from him. If there are any questions I'll be in the south wing." 
    "As you will, my Lady," Mapes said.
    Jessica turned away, thinking: Hawat may have passed this residency as safe, but there's something wrong about the place. I can feel it.
    An urgent need to see her son gripped Jessica. She began walking toward the arched doorway that led into the passage to the dining hall and the family wings. Faster and faster she walked until she was almost running.
    Behind her, Mapes paused in clearing the wrappings from the bull's head, looked at the retreating back. "She's the One all right," she muttered. "Poor thing."

"Yueh! Yueh! Yueh!" goes the refrain. "A million deaths were not enough for Yueh!"
-from "A Child's History of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    The door stood ajar, and Jessica stepped through it into a room with yellow walls. To her left stretched a low settee of black hide and two empty bookcases, a hanging waterflask with dust on its bulging sides. To her right, bracketing another door, stood more empty bookcases, a desk from Caladan and three chairs. At the windows directly ahead of her stood Dr. Yueh, his back to her, his attention fixed upon the outside world. 
    Jessica took another silent step into the room.
    She saw that Yueh's coat was wrinkled, a white smudge near the left elbow as though he had leaned against chalk. He looked, from behind, like a fleshless stick figure in overlarge black clothing, a caricature poised for stringy movement at the direction of a puppet master. Only the squarish block of head with long ebony hair caught in its silver Suk School ring at the shoulder seemed alive--turning slightly to follow some movement outside.
    Again, she glanced around the room, seeing no sign of her son, but the closed door on her right, she knew, let into a small bedroom for which Paul had expressed a liking.
    "Good afternoon. Dr. Yueh," she said. "Where's Paul?" 
    He nodded as though to something out the window, spoke in an absent manner without turning: "Your son grew tired, Jessica. I sent him into the next room to rest."
    Abruptly, he stiffened, whirled with mustache flopping over his purpled lips. "Forgive me, my Lady! My thoughts were far away . . . I . . . did not mean to be familiar."
    She smiled, held out her right hand. For a moment, she was afraid he might kneel. "Wellington, please." 
    "To use your name like that . . . I . . . "
    "We've known each other six years," she said. "It's long past time formalities should've been dropped between us--in private." 
    Yueh ventured a thin smile, thinking: I believe it has worked. Now, she'll think anything unusual in my manner is due to embarrassment. She'll not look for deeper reasons when she believes she already knows the answer.
    "I'm afraid I was woolgathering," he said. "Whenever I . . . feel especially sorry for you. I'm afraid I think of you as . . . well, Jessica." 
    "Sorry for me? Whatever for?"
    Yueh shrugged. Long ago, he had realized Jessica was not gifted with the full Truthsay as his Wanna had been. Still, he always used the truth with Jessica whenever possible. It was safest.
    "You've seen this place, my . . . Jessica." He stumbled over the name, plunged ahead: "So barren after Caladan. And the people! Those townswomen we passed on the way here wailing beneath their veils. The way they looked at us."
    She folded her arms across her breast, hugging herself, feeling the crysknife there, a blade ground from a sandworm's tooth, if the reports were right. "It's just that we're strange to them--different people, different customs. They've known only the Harkonnens." She looked past him out the windows. "What were you staring at out there?" 
    He turned back to the window. "The people." 
    Jessica crossed to his side, looked to the left toward the front of the house where Yueh's attention was focused. A line of twenty palm trees grew there, the ground beneath them swept clean, barren. A screen fence separated them from the road upon which robed people were passing. Jessica detected a faint shimmering in the air between her and the people--a house shield--and went on to study the passing throng, wondering why Yueh found them so absorbing.
    The pattern emerged and she put a hand to her cheek. The way the passing people looked at the palm trees! She saw envy, some hate . . . even a sense of hope. Each person raked those trees with a fixity of expression.
    "Do you know what they're thinking?" Yueh asked. 
    "You profess to read minds?" she asked.
    "Those minds," he said. "They look at those trees and they think; 'There are one hundred of us.' That's what they think." 
    She turned a puzzled frown on him. "Why?"
    "Those are date palms," he said. "One date palm requires forty liters of water a day. A man requires but eight liters. A palm, then, equals five men. There are twenty palms out there--one hundred men." 
    "But some of those people look at the trees hopefully." 
    "They but hope some dates will fall, except it's the wrong season."
    "We look at this place with too critical an eye," she said. "There's hope as well as danger here. The spice could make us rich. With a fat treasury, we can make this world into whatever we wish."
    And she laughed silently at herself: Who am I trying to convince? The laugh broke through her restraints, emerging brittle, without humor. "But you can't buy security," she said.
    Yueh turned away to hide his face from her. If only it were possible to hate these people instead of love them! In her manner, in many ways, Jessica was like his Wanna. Yet that thought carried its own rigors, hardening him to his purpose. The ways of the Harkonnen cruelty were devious. Wanna might not be dead. He had to be certain.
    "Do not worry for us, Wellington," Jessica said. "The problem's ours, not yours."
    She thinks I worry for her! He blinked back tears. And I do, of course. But I must stand before that black Baron with his deed accomplished, and take my one chance to strike him where he is weakest--in his gloating moment! 
    He sighed.
    "Would it disturb Paul if I looked in on him?" she asked. 
    "Not at all. I gave him a sedative." 
    "He's taking the change well?" she asked.
    "Except for getting a bit overtired. He's excited, but what fifteen-year-old wouldn't be under these circumstances?" He crossed to the door, opened it. "He's in here." 
    Jessica followed, peered into a shadowy room.
    Paul lay on a narrow cot, one arm beneath a light cover, the other thrown back over his head. Slatted blinds at a window beside the bed wove a loom of shadows across face and blanket.
    Jessica stared at her son, seeing the oval shape of face so like her own. But the hair was the Duke's--coal-colored and tousled. Long lashes concealed the lime-toned eyes. Jessica smiled, feeling her fears retreat. She was suddenly caught by the idea of genetic traces in her son's features--her lines in eyes and facial outline, but sharp touches of the father peering through that outline like maturity emerging from childhood.
    She thought of the boy's features as an exquisite distillation out of random patterns--endless queues of happenstance meeting at this nexus. The thought made her want to kneel beside the bed and take her son in her arms, but she was inhibited by Yueh's presence. She stepped back, closed the door softly.
    Yueh had returned to the window, unable to bear watching the way Jessica stared at her son. Why did Wanna never give me children? he asked himself. I know as a doctor there was no physical reason against it. Was there some Bene Gesserit reason? Was she, perhaps, instructed to serve a different purpose? What could it have been? She loved me, certainly.
    For the first time, he was caught up in the thought that he might be part of a pattern more involuted and complicated than his mind could grasp.
    Jessica stopped beside him, said: "What delicious abandon in the sleep of a child." 
    He spoke mechanically: "If only adults could relax like that." 
    "Yes." 
    "Where do we lose it?" he murmured.
    She glanced at him, catching the odd tone, but her mind was still on Paul, thinking of the new rigors in his training here, thinking of the differences in his life now--so very different from the life they once had planned for him.
    "We do, indeed, lose something," she said.
    She glanced out to the right at a slope humped with a wind-troubled gray-green of bushes--dusty leaves and dry claw branches. The too-dark sky hung over the slope like a blot, and the milky light of the Arrakeen sun gave the scene a silver cast--light like the crysknife concealed in her bodice. 
    "The sky's so dark," she said.
    "That's partly the lack of moisture," he said.
    "Water!" she snapped. "Everywhere you turn here, you're involved with the lack of water!" 
    "It's the precious mystery of Arrakis," he said.
    "Why is there so little of it? There's volcanic rock here. There're a dozen power sources I could name. There's polar ice. They say you can't drill in the desert--storms and sandtides destroy equipment faster than it can be installed, if the worms don't get you first. They've never found water traces there, anyway. But the mystery, Wellington, the real mystery is the wells that've been drilled up here in the sinks and basins. Have you read about those?" 
    "First a trickle, then nothing," he said.
    "But, Wellington, that's the mystery. The water was there. It dries up. And never again is there water. Yet another hole nearby produces the same result: a trickle that stops. Has no one ever been curious about this?"
    "It is curious," he said. "You suspect some living agency? Wouldn't that have shown in core samples?"
    "What would have shown? Alien plant matter . . . or animal? Who could recognize it?" She turned back to the slope. "The water is stopped. Something plugs it. That's my suspicion." 
    "Perhaps the reason's known," he said. "The Harkonnens sealed off many sources of information about Arrakis. Perhaps there was reason to suppress this."
    "What reason?" she asked. "And then there's the atmospheric moisture. Little enough of it, certainly, but there's some. It's the major source of water here, caught in windtraps and precipitators. Where does that come from?" 
    "The polar caps?"
    "Cold air takes up little moisture, Wellington. There are things here behind the Harkonnen veil that bear close investigation, and not all of those things are directly involved with the spice."
    "We are indeed behind the Harkonnen veil," he said. "Perhaps we'll . . . " He broke off, noting the sudden intense way she was looking at him. "Is something wrong?"
    "The way you say 'Harkonnen,' " she said. "Even my Duke's voice doesn't carry that weight of venom when he uses the hated name. I didn't know you had personal reasons to hate them, Wellington."
    Great Mother! he thought. I've aroused her suspicions! Now I must use every trick my Wanna taught me. There's only one solution: tell the truth as far as I can.
    He said: "You didn't know that my wife, my Wanna . . . " He shrugged, unable to speak past a sudden constriction in his throat. Then: "They . . . " The words would not come out. He felt panic, closed his eyes tightly, experiencing the agony in his chest and little else until a hand touched his arm gently.
    "Forgive me," Jessica said. "I did not mean to open an old wound." And she thought: Those animals! His wife was Bene Gesserit--the signs are all over him. And it's obvious the Harkonnens killed her. Here's another poor victim bound to the Atreides by a cherem of hate.
    "I am sorry," he said. "I'm unable to talk about it." He opened his eyes, giving himself up to the internal awareness of grief. That, at least, was truth.
    Jessica studied him, seeing the up-angled cheeks, the dark sequins of almond eyes, the butter complexion, and stringy mustache hanging like a curved frame around purpled lips and narrow chin. The creases of his cheeks and forehead, she saw, were as much lines of sorrow as of age. A deep affection for him came over her.
    "Wellington, I'm sorry we brought you into this dangerous place," she said.
    "I came willingly," he said. And that, too, was true.
    "But this whole planet's a Harkonnen trap. You must know that."
    "It will take more than a trap to catch the Duke Leto," he said. And that, too, was true.
    "Perhaps I should be more confident of him," she said. "He is a brilliant tactician." 
    "We've been uprooted," he said. "That's why we're uneasy." 
    "And how easy it is to kill the uprooted plant," she said. "Especially when you put it down in hostile soil." 
    "Are we certain the soil's hostile?"
    "There were water riots when it was learned how many people the Duke was adding to the population," she said. "They stopped only when the people learned we were installing new windtraps and condensers to take care of the load."
    "There is only so much water to support human life here," he said. "The people know if more come to drink a limited amount of water, the price goes up and the very poor die. But the Duke has solved this. It doesn't follow that the riots mean permanent hostility toward him."
    "And guards," she said. "Guards everywhere. And shields. You see the blurring of them everywhere you look. We did not live this way on Caladan." 
    "Give this planet a chance," he said.
    But Jessica continued to stare hard-eyed out the window. "I can smell death in this place," she said. "Hawat sent advance agents in here by the battalion. Those guards outside are his men. The cargo handlers are his men. There've been unexplained withdrawals of large sums from the treasury. The amounts mean only one thing: bribes in high places." She shook her head. "Where Thufir Hawat goes, death and deceit follow." 
    "You malign him."
    "Malign? I praise him. Death and deceit are our only hopes now. I just do not fool myself about Thufir's methods." 
    "You should . . . keep busy," he said. "Give yourself no time for such morbid--"
    "Busy! What is it that takes most of my time, Wellington? I am the Duke's secretary--so busy that each day I learn new things to fear . . . things even he doesn't suspect I know." She compressed her lips, spoke thinly: "Sometimes I wonder how much my Bene Gesserit business training figured in his choice of me." 
    "What do you mean?" He found himself caught by the cynical tone, the bitterness that he had never seen her expose.
    "Don't you think, Wellington," she asked, "that a secretary bound to one by love is so much safer?" 
    "That is not a worthy thought, Jessica."
    The rebuke came naturally to his lips. There was no doubt how the Duke felt about his concubine. One had only to watch him as he followed her with his eyes.
    She sighed. "You're right. It's not worthy."
    Again, she hugged herself, pressing the sheathed crysknife against her flesh and thinking of the unfinished business it represented.
    "There'll be much bloodshed soon," she said. "The Harkonnens won't rest until they're dead or my Duke destroyed. The Baron cannot forget that Leto is a cousin of the royal blood--no matter what the distance--while the Harkonnen titles came out of the CHOAM pocketbook. But the poison in him, deep in his mind, is the knowledge that an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after, the Battle of Corrin."
    "The old feud," Yueh muttered. And for a moment he felt an acid touch of hate. The old feud had trapped him in its web, killed his Wanna or--worse--left her for Harkonnen tortures until her husband did their bidding. The old feud had trapped him and these people were part of that poisonous thing. The irony was that such deadliness should come to flower here on Arrakis, the one source in the universe of melange, the prolonger of life, the giver of health.
    "What are you thinking?" she asked.
    "I am thinking that the spice brings six hundred and twenty thousand Solaris the decagram on the open market right now. That is wealth to buy many things." 
    "Does greed touch even you, Wellington?" 
    "Not greed." 
    "What then?"
    He shrugged. "Futility." He glanced at her. "Can you remember your first taste of spice?" 
    "It tasted like cinnamon."
    "But never twice the same," he said. "It's like life--it presents a different face each time you take it. Some hold that the spice produces a learned-flavor reaction. The body, learning a thing is good for it, interprets the flavor as pleasurable--slightly euphoric. And, like life, never to be truly synthesized."
    "I think it would've been wiser for us to go renegade, to take ourselves beyond the Imperial reach," she said.
    He saw that she hadn't been listening to him, focused on her words, wondering: Yes--why didn't she make him do this? She could make him do virtually anything.
    He spoke quickly because here was truth and a change of subject: "Would you think it bold of me . . . Jessica, if I asked a personal question?"
    She pressed against the window ledge in an unexplainable pang of disquiet. "Of course not. You're . . . my friend." 
    "Why haven't you made the Duke marry you?" 
    She whirled, head up, glaring. "Made him marry me? But--" 
    "I should not have asked," he said.
    "No." She shrugged. "There's good political reason--as long as my Duke remains unmarried some of the Great Houses can still hope for alliance. And . . . " She sighed. " . . . motivating people, forcing them to your will, gives you a cynical attitude toward humanity. It degrades everything it touches. If I made him do . . . this, then it would not be his doing."
    "It's a thing my Wanna might have said," he murmured. And this, too, was truth. He put a hand to his mouth, swallowing convulsively. He had never been closer to speaking out, confessing his secret role.
    Jessica spoke, shattering the moment. "Besides, Wellington, the Duke is really two men. One of them I love very much. He's charming, witty, considerate . . . tender--everything a woman could desire. But the other man is . . . cold, callous, demanding, selfish--as harsh and cruel as a winter wind. That's the man shaped by the father." Her face contorted. "If only that old man had died when my Duke was born!"
    In the silence that came between them, a breeze from a ventilator could be heard fingering the blinds.
    Presently, she took a deep breath, said, "Leto's right--these rooms are nicer than the ones in the other sections of the house." She turned, sweeping the room with her gaze. "If you'll excuse me, Wellington, I want another look through this wing before I assign quarters."
    He nodded. "Of course." And he thought: if only there were some way not to do this thing that I must do.
    Jessica dropped her arms, crossed to the hall door and stood there a moment, hesitating, then let herself out. All the time we talked he was hiding something, holding something back, she thought. To save my feelings, no doubt. He's a good man. Again, she hesitated, almost turned back to confront Yueh and drag the hidden thing from him. But that would only shame him, frighten him to learn he's so easily read. I should place more trust in my friends.

Many have marked the speed with which Muad'Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.

    Paul lay on the bed feigning sleep. It had been easy to palm Dr. Yueh's sleeping tablet, to pretend to swallow it. Paul suppressed a laugh. Even his mother had believed him asleep. He had wanted to jump up and ask her permission to go exploring the house, but had realized she wouldn't approve. Things were too unsettled yet. No. This way was best.
    If I slip out without asking I haven't disobeyed orders. And I will stay in the house where it's safe.
    He heard his mother and Yueh talking in the other room. Their words were indistinct--something about the spice . . . the Harkonnens. The conversation rose and fell.
    Paul's attention went to the carved headboard of his bed--a false headboard attached to the wall and concealing the controls for this room's functions. A leaping fish had been shaped on the wood with thick brown waves beneath it. He knew if he pushed the fish's one visible eye that would turn on the room's suspensor lamps. One of the waves, when twisted, controlled ventilation. Another changed the temperature.
    Quietly, Paul sat up in bed. A tall bookcase stood against the wall to his left. It could be swung aside to reveal a closet with drawers along one side. The handle on the door into the hall was patterned on an ornithopter thrust bar.
    It was as though the room had been designed to entice him. 
    The room and this planet.
    He thought of the filmbook Yueh had shown him--"Arrakis: His Imperial Majesty's Desert Botanical Testing Station." It was an old filmbook from before discovery of the spice. Names flitted through Paul's mind, each with its picture imprinted by the book's mnemonic pulse: saguaro, burro bush, date palm, sand verbena, evening primrose, barrel cactus, incense bush, smoke tree, creosote bush . . . kit fox, desert hawk, kangaroo mouse . . . 
    Names and pictures, names and pictures from man's terranic past--and many to be found now nowhere else in the universe except here on Arrakis.
    So many new things to learn about--the spice. 
    And the sandworms.
    A door closed in the other room. Paul heard his mother's footsteps retreating down the hall. Dr. Yueh, he knew, would find something to read and remain in the other room. 
    Now was the moment to go exploring.
    Paul slipped out of the bed, headed for the bookcase door that opened into the closet. He stopped at a sound behind him, turned. The carved headboard of the bed was folding down onto the spot where he had been sleeping. Paul froze, and immobility saved his life.
    From behind the headboard slipped a tiny hunter-seeker no more than five centimeters long. Paul recognized it at once--a common assassination weapon that every child of royal blood learned about at an early age. It was a ravening sliver of metal guided by some near-by hand and eye. It could burrow into moving flesh and chew its way up nerve channels to the nearest vital organ. 
    The seeker lifted, swung sideways across the room and back.
    Through Paul's mind flashed the related knowledge, the hunter-seeker limitations: Its compressed suspensor field distorted the vision of its transmitter eye. With nothing but the dim light of the room to reflect his target, the operator would be relying on motion--anything that moved. A shield could slow a hunter, give time to destroy it, but Paul had put aside his shield on the bed. Lasguns would knock them down, but lasguns were expensive and notoriously cranky of maintenance--and there was always the peril of explosive pyrotechnics if the laser beam intersected a hot shield. The Atreides relied on their body shields and their wits.
    Now, Paul held himself in near catatonic immobility, knowing he had only his wits to meet this threat.
    The hunter-seeker lifted another half meter. It rippled through the slatted light from the window blinds, back and forth, quartering the room.
    I must try to grab it, he thought. The suspensor field will make it slippery on the bottom. I must grip tightly.
    The thing dropped a half meter, quartered to the left, circled back around the bed. A faint humming could be heard from it.
    Who is operating that thing? Paul wondered. It has to be someone near. I could shout for Yueh, but it would take him the instant the door opened.
    The hall door behind Paul creaked. A rap sounded there. The door opened.
    The hunter-seeker arrowed past his head toward the motion.
    Paul's right hand shot out and down, gripping the deadly thing. It hummed and twisted in his hand, but his muscles were locked on it in desperation. With a violent turn and thrust, he slammed the thing's nose against the metal doorplate. He felt the crunch of it as the nose eye smashed and the seeker went dead in his hand. 
    Still, he held it--to be certain.
    Paul's eyes came up, met the open stare of total blue from the Shadout Mapes.
    "Your father has sent for you," she said. "There are men in the hall to escort you."
    Paul nodded, his eyes and awareness focusing on this odd woman in a sack-like dress of bondsman brown. She was looking now at the thing clutched in his hand.
    "I've heard of suchlike," she said. "It would've killed me, not so?" 
    He had to swallow before he could speak. "I . . . was its target." 
    "But it was coming for me."
    "Because you were moving." And he wondered: Who is this creature?
    "Then you saved my life," she said. 
    "I saved both our lives."
    "Seems like you could've let it have me and made your own escape," she said.
    "Who are you?" he asked.
    "The Shadout Mapes, housekeeper." 
    "How did you know where to find me?"
    "Your mother told me. I met her at the stairs to the weirding room down the hall." She pointed to her right. "Your father's men are still waiting."
    Those will be Hawat's men, he thought. We must find the operator of this thing.
    "Go to my father's men," he said. "Tell them I've caught a hunter-seeker in the house and they're to spread out and find the operator. Tell them to seal off the house and its grounds immediately. They'll know how to go about it. The operator's sure to be a stranger among us."
    And he wondered: Could it be this creature? But he knew it wasn't. The seeker had been under control when she entered.
    "Before I do your bidding, manling," Mapes said, "I must cleanse the way between us. You've put a water burden on me that I'm not sure I care to support. But we Fremen pay our debts--be they black debts or white debts. And it's known to us that you've a traitor in your midst. Who it is, we cannot say, but we're certain sure of it. Mayhap there's the hand guided that flesh-cutter." 
    Paul absorbed this in silence: a traitor. Before he could speak, the odd woman whirled away and ran back toward the entry.
    He thought to call her back, but there was an air about her that told him she would resent it. She'd told him what she knew and now she was going to do his bidding. The house would be swarming with Hawat's men in a minute.
    His mind went to other parts of that strange conversation: weirding room. He looked to his left where she had pointed. We Fremen. So that was a Fremen. He paused for the mnemonic blink that would store the pattern of her face in his memory--prune-wrinkled features darkly browned, blue-on-blue eyes without any white in them. He attached the label: The Shadout Mapes.
    Still gripping the shattered seeker, Paul turned back into his room, scooped up his shield belt from the bed with his left hand, swung it around his waist and buckled it as he ran back out and down the hall to the left.
    She'd said his mother was someplace down here--stairs . . . a weirding room.

What had the Lady Jessica to sustain her in her time of trial? Think you carefully on this Bene Gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see: "Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain."
-from "Muad'Dib: Family Commentaries" by the Princess Irulan

    At the end of the south wing, Jessica found a metal stair spiraling up to an oval door. She glanced back down the hall, again up at the door.
    Oval? she wondered. What an odd shape for a door in a house.
    Through the windows beneath the spiral stair she could see the great white sun of Arrakis moving on toward evening. Long shadows stabbed down the hall. She returned her attention to the stairs. Harsh sidelighting picked out bits of dried earth on the open metalwork of the steps.
    Jessica put a hand on the rail, began to climb. The rail felt cold under her sliding palm. She stopped at the door, saw it had no handle, but there was a faint depression on the surface of it where a handle should have been.
    Surely not a palm lock, she told herself. A palm lock must be keyed to one individual's hand shape and palm lines. But it looked like a palm lock. And there were ways to open any palm lock--as she had learned at school.
    Jessica glanced back to make certain she was unobserved, placed her palm against the depression in the door. The most gentle of pressures to distort the lines--a turn of the wrist, another turn, a sliding twist of the palm across the surface. 
    She felt the click.
    But there were hurrying footsteps in the hall beneath her. Jessica lifted her hand from the door, turned, saw Mapes come to the foot of the stairs.
    "There are men in the great hall say they've been sent by the Duke to get young master Paul," Mapes said. "They've the ducal signet and the guard has identified them." She glanced at the door, back to Jessica.
    A cautious one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. That's a good sign.
    "He's in the fifth room from this end of the hall, the small bedroom," Jessica said. "If you have trouble waking him, call on Dr. Yueh in the next room. Paul may require a wakeshot." 
    Again, Mapes cast a piercing stare at the oval door, and Jessica thought she detected loathing in the expression. Before Jessica could ask about the door and what it concealed, Mapes had turned away, hurrying back down the hall.
    Hawat certified this place, Jessica thought. There can't be anything too terrible in here.
    She pushed the door. It swung inward onto a small room with another oval door opposite. The other door had a wheel handle.
    An airlock! Jessica thought. She glanced down, saw a door prop fallen to the floor of the little room. The prop carried Hawat's personal mark. The door was left propped open, she thought. Someone probably knocked the prop down accidentally, not realizing the outer door would close on a palm lock. 
    She stepped over the lip into the little room.
    Why an airlock in a house? she asked herself. And she thought suddenly of exotic creatures sealed off in special climates. 
    Special climate!
    That would make sense on Arrakis where even the driest of off-planet growing things had to be irrigated.
    The door behind her began swinging closed. She caught it and propped it open securely with the stick Hawat had left. Again, she faced the wheel-locked inner door, seeing now a faint inscription etched in the metal above the handle. She recognized Galach words, read:
    "O, Man! Here is a lovely portion of God's Creation; then, stand before it and learn to love the perfection of Thy Supreme Friend." 
    Jessica put her weight on the wheel. It turned left and the inner door opened. A gentle draft feathered her cheek, stirred her hair. She felt change in the air, a richer taste. She swung the door wide, looked through into massed greenery with yellow sunlight pouring across it.
    A yellow sun? she asked herself. Then: Filter glass! 
    She stepped over the sill and the door swung closed behind. 
    "A wet-planet conservatory," she breathed:
    Potted plants and low-pruned trees stood all about. She recognized a mimosa, a flowering quince, a sondagi, green-blossomed pleniscenta, green and white striped akarso . . . roses . . . 
    Even roses!
    She bent to breathe the fragrance of a giant pink blossom, straightened to peer around the room. 
    Rhythmic noise invaded her senses.
    She parted a jungle overlapping of leaves, looked through to the center of the room. A low fountain stood there, small with fluted lips. The rhythmic noise was a peeling, spooling arc of water falling thud-a-gallop onto the metal bowl.
    Jessica sent herself through the quick sense-clearing regimen, began a methodical inspection of the room's perimeter. It appeared to be about ten meters square. From its placement above the end of the hall and from subtle differences in construction, she guessed it had been added onto the roof of this wing long after the original building's completion.
    She stopped at the south limits of the room in front of the wide reach of filter glass, stared around. Every available space in the room was crowded with exotic wet-climate plants. Something rustled in the greenery. She tensed, then glimpsed a simple clock-set servok with pipe and hose arms. An arm lifted, sent out a fine spray of dampness that misted her cheeks. The arm retracted and she looked at what it had watered: a fern tree.
    Water everywhere in this room--on a planet where water was the most precious juice of life. Water being wasted so conspicuously that it shocked her to inner stillness.
    She glanced out at the filter-yellowed sun. It hung low on a jagged horizon above cliffs that formed part of the immense rock uplifting known as the Shield Wall.
    Filter glass, she thought. To turn a white sun into something softer and more familiar. Who could have built such a place? Leto? It would be like him to surprise me with such a gift, but there hasn't been time. And he's been busy with more serious problems.
    She recalled the report that many Arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock doors and windows to conserve and reclaim interior moisture. Leto had said it was a deliberate statement of power and wealth for this house to ignore such precautions, its doors and windows being sealed only against the omnipresent dust.
    But this room embodied a statement far more significant than the lack of waterseals on outer doors. She estimated that this pleasure room used water enough to support a thousand persons on Arrakis--possibly more.
    Jessica moved along the window, continuing to stare into the room. The move brought into view a metallic surface at table height beside the fountain and she glimpsed a white notepad and stylus there partly concealed by an overhanging fan leaf. She crossed to the table, noted Hawat's daysigns on it, studied a message written on the pad:

 "TO THE LADY JESSICA--
May this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me. Please permit the room to convey a lesson we learned from the same teachers: the proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.
 My kindest wishes,
 MARGOT LADY FENRING"

    Jessica nodded, remembering that Leto had referred to the Emperor's former proxy here as Count Fenring. But the hidden message of the note demanded immediate attention, couched as it was in a way to inform her the writer was another Bene Gesserit. A bitter thought touched Jessica in passing: The Count married his Lady.
    Even as this thought flicked through her mind, she was bending to seek out the hidden message. It had to be there. The visible note contained the code phrase every Bene Gesserit not bound by a School Injunction was required to give another Bene Gesserit when conditions demanded it: "On that path lies danger." 
    Jessica felt the back of the note, rubbed the surface for coded dots. Nothing. The edge of the pad came under her seeking fingers. Nothing. She replaced the pad where she had found it, feeling a sense of urgency.
    Something in the position of the pad? she wondered.
    But Hawat had been over this room, doubtless had moved the pad. She looked at the leaf above the pad. The leaf! She brushed a finger along the under surface, along the edge, along the stem. It was there! Her fingers detected the subtle coded dots, scanned them in a single passage:
    "Your son and Duke are in immediate danger. A bedroom has been designed to attract your son. The H loaded it with death traps to be discovered, leaving one that may escape detection." Jessica put down the urge to run back to Paul; the full message had to be learned. Her fingers sped over the dots; "I do not know the exact nature of the menace, but it has something to do with a bed. The threat to your Duke involves defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant. The H plan to give you as gift to a minion. To the best of my knowledge, this conservatory is safe. Forgive that I cannot tell more. My sources are few as my Count is not in the pay of the H. In haste, MF."
    Jessica thrust the leaf aside, whirled to dash back to Paul. In that instant, the airlock door slammed open. Paul jumped through it, holding something in his right hand, slammed the door behind him. He saw his mother, pushed through the leaves to her, glanced at the fountain, thrust his hand and the thing it clutched under the falling water.
    "Paul!" She grabbed his shoulder, staring at the hand. "What is that?"
    He spoke casually, but she caught the effort behind the tone: "Hunter-seeker. Caught it in my room and smashed its nose, but I want to be sure. Water should short it out." 
    "Immerse it!" she commanded. 
    He obeyed.
    Presently, she said: "Withdraw your hand. Leave the thing in the water."
    He brought out his hand, shook water from it, staring at the quiescent metal in the fountain. Jessica broke off a plant stem, prodded the deadly sliver. 
    It was dead.
    She dropped the stem into the water, looked at Paul. His eyes studied the room with a searching intensity that she recognized--the B.G. Way.
    "This place could conceal anything," he said. 
    "I've reason to believe it's safe," she said. 
    "My room was supposed to be safe, too. Hawat said--" 
    "It was a hunter-seeker," she reminded him "That means someone inside the house to operate it. Seeker control beams have a limited range. The thing could've been spirited in here after Hawat's investigation."
    But she thought of the message of the leaf: " . . . defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant." Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.
    "Hawat's men are searching the house right now," he said. "That seeker almost got the old woman who came to wake me."
    "The Shadout Mapes," Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the stairs. "A summons from your father to--" 
    "That can wait," Paul said. "Why do you think this room's safe?" 
    She pointed to the note, explained about it. 
    He relaxed slightly.
    But Jessica remained inwardly tense, thinking: A hunter-seeker! Merciful Mother! It took all her training to prevent a fit of hysterical trembling.
    Paul spoke matter of factly: "It's the Harkonnens, of course. We shall have to destroy them."
    A rapping sounded at the airlock door--the code knock of one of Hawat's corps.
    "Come in," Paul called.
    The door swung wide and a tall man in Atreides uniform with a Hawat insignia on his cap leaned into the room. "There you are, sir," he said. "The housekeeper said you'd be here." He glanced around the room. "We found a cairn in the cellar and caught a man in it. He had a seeker console." 
    "I'll want to take part in the interrogation," Jessica said. 
    "Sorry, my Lady. We messed him up catching him. He died." 
    "Nothing to identify him?" she asked. 
    "We've found nothing yet, my Lady." 
    "Was he an Arrakeen native?" Paul asked. 
    Jessica nodded at the astuteness of the question.
    "He has the native look," the man said. "Put into that cairn more'n a month ago, by the look, and left there to await our coming. Stone and mortar where he came through into the cellar were untouched when we inspected the place yesterday. I'll stake my reputation on it." 
    "No one questions your thoroughness," Jessica said.
    "I question it, my Lady. We should've used sonic probes down there." 
    "I presume that's what you're doing now," Paul said. 
    "Yes, sir."
    "Send word to my father that we'll be delayed." 
    "At once, sir." He glanced at Jessica. "It's Hawat's order that under such circumstances as these the young master be guarded in a safe place." Again, his eyes swept the room. "What of this place?"
    "I've reason to believe it safe," she said. "Both Hawat and I have inspected it."
    "Then I'll mount guard outside here, m'Lady, until we've been over the house once more." He bowed, touched his cap to Paul, backed out and swung the door closed behind him.
    Paul broke the sudden silence, saying: "Had we better go over the house later ourselves? Your eyes might see things others would miss."
    "This wing was the only place I hadn't examined," she said. "I put if off to last because . . . " 
    "Because Hawat gave it his personal attention," he said. 
    She darted a quick look at his face, questioning. 
    "Do you distrust Hawat?" she asked.
    "No, but he's getting old . . . he's overworked. We could take some of the load from him."
    "That'd only shame him and impair his efficiency," she said. "A stray insect won't be able to wander into this wing after he hears about this. He'll be shamed that . . . " 
    "We must take our own measures," he said.
    "Hawat has served three generations of Atreides with honor," she said. "He deserves every respect and trust we can pay him . . . many times over."
    Paul said: "When my father is bothered by something you've done he says 'Bene Gesserit!' like a swear word." 
    "And what is it about me that bothers your father?" 
    "When you argue with him." 
    "You are not your father, Paul."
    And Paul thought: It'll worry her, but I must tell her what that Mapes woman said about a traitor among us.
    "What're you holding back?" Jessica asked. "This isn't like you, Paul." 
    He shrugged, recounted the exchange with Mapes.
    And Jessica thought of the message of the leaf. She came to sudden decision, showed Paul the leaf, told him its message.
    "My father must learn of this at once," he said. "I'll radiograph it in code and get if off."
    "No," she said. "You will wait until you can see him alone. As few as possible must learn about it."
    "Do you mean we should trust no one?"
    "There's another possibility," she said. "This message may have been meant to get to us. The people who gave it to us may believe it's true, but it may be that the only purpose was to get this message to us."
    Paul's face remained sturdily somber. "To sow distrust and suspicion in our ranks, to weaken us that way," he said.
    "You must tell your father privately and caution him about this aspect of it, " she said. 
    "I understand."
    She turned to the tall reach of filter glass, stared out to the southwest where the sun of Arrakis was sinking--a yellowed ball above the cliffs.
    Paul turned with her, said: "I don't think it's Hawat, either. Is it possible it's Yueh?"
    "He's not a lieutenant or companion," she said. "And I can assure you he hates the Harkonnens as bitterly as we do." 
    Paul directed his attention to the cliffs, thinking: And it couldn't be Gurney . . . or Duncan. Could it be one of the sub-lieutenants? Impossible. They're all from families that've been loyal to us for generations--for good reason.
    Jessica rubbed her forehead, sensing her own fatigue. So much peril here! She looked out at the filter-yellowed landscape, studying it. Beyond the ducal grounds stretched a high-fenced storage yard--lines of spice silos in it with stilt-legged watchtowers standing around it like so many startled spiders. She could see at least twenty storage yards of silos reaching out to the cliffs of the Shield Wall--silos repeated, stuttering across the basin.
    Slowly, the filtered sun buried itself beneath the horizon. Stars leaped out. She saw one bright star so low on the horizon that it twinkled with a clear, precise rhythm--a trembling of light: blink-blink-blink-blink-blink . . . 
    Paul stirred beside her in the dusky room.
    But Jessica concentrated on that single bright star, realizing that it was too low, that it must come from the Shield Wall cliffs. 
    Someone signaling!
    She tried to read the message, but it was in no code she had ever learned.
    Other lights had come on down on the plain beneath the cliffs: little yellows spaced out against blue darkness. And one light off to their left grew brighter, began to wink back at the cliff--very fast: blinksquirt, glimmer, blink!
    And it was gone.
    The false star in the cliff winked out immediately. 
    Signals . . . and they filled her with premonition.
    Why were lights used to signal across the basin? she asked herself. Why couldn't they use the communications network?
    The answer was obvious: the communinet was certain to be tapped now by agents of the Duke Leto. Light signals could only mean that messages were being sent between his enemies--between Harkonnen agents.
    There came a tapping at the door behind them and the voice of Hawat's man; "All clear, sir . . . m'Lady. Time to be getting the young master to his father."

= = = = = =

It is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of Arrakis, that he walked heedlessly into the pit. Would it not be more likely to suggest he had lived so long in the presence of extreme danger he misjudged a change in its intensity? Or is it possible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son might find a better life? All evidence indicates the Duke was a man not easily hoodwinked.
-from "Muad'Dib: Family Commentaries" by the Princess Irulan

    The Duke Leto Atreides leaned against a parapet of the landing control tower outside Arrakeen. The night's first moon, an oblate silver coin, hung well above the southern horizon. Beneath it, the jagged cliffs of the Shield Wall shone like parched icing through a dust haze. To his left, the lights of Arrakeen glowed in the haze--yellow . . . white . . . blue.
    He thought of the notices posted now above his signature all through the populous places of the planet: "Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute."
    The ritualistic formality of it touched him with a feeling of loneliness. Who was fooled by that fatuous legalism? Not the Fremen, certainly. Nor the Houses Minor who controlled the interior trade of Arrakis . . . and were Harkonnen creatures almost to a man.
    They have tried to take the life of my son!
    The rage was difficult to suppress.
    He saw lights of a moving vehicle coming toward the landing field from Arrakeen. He hoped it was the guard and troop carrier bringing Paul. The delay was galling even though he knew it was prompted by caution on the part of Hawat's lieutenant. 
    They have tried to take the life of my son!
    He shook his head to drive out the angry thoughts, glanced back at the field where five of his own frigates were posted around the rim like monolithic sentries.
    Better a cautious delay than . . . 
    The lieutenant was a good one, he reminded himself. A man marked for advancement, completely loyal.
    "Our Sublime Padishah Emperor . . . "
    If the people of this decadent garrison city could only see the Emperor's private note to his "Noble Duke"--the disdainful allusions to veiled men and women: " . . . but what else is one to expect of barbarians whose dearest dream is to live outside the ordered security of the faufreluches?"
    The Duke felt in this moment that his own dearest dream was to end all class distinctions and never again think of deadly order. He looked up and out of the dust at the unwinking stars, thought: Around one of those little lights circles Caladan . . . but I'll never again see my home. The longing for Caladan was a sudden pain in his breast. He felt that it did not come from within himself, but that it reached out to him from Caladan. He could not bring himself to call this dry wasteland of Arrakis his home, and he doubted he ever would.
    I must mask my feelings, he thought. For the boy's sake. If ever he's to have a home, this must be it. I may think of Arrakis as a hell I've reached before death, but he must find here that which will inspire him. There must be something.
    A wave of self-pity, immediately despised and rejected, swept through him, and for some reason he found himself recalling two lines from a poem Gurney Halleck often repeated--

"My lungs taste the air of Time 
Blown past falling sands . . . "

    Well, Gurney would find plenty of falling sands here, the Duke thought. The central wastelands beyond those moon-frosted cliffs were desert--barren rock, dunes, and blowing dust, an uncharted dry wilderness with here and there along its rim and perhaps scattered through it, knots of Fremen. If anything could buy a future for the Atreides line, the Fremen just might do it.
    Provided the Harkonnens hadn't managed to infect even the Fremen with their poisonous schemes. 
    They have tried to take the life of my son!
    A scraping metal racket vibrated through the tower, shook the parapet beneath his arms. Blast shutters dropped in front of him, blocking the view.
    Shuttle's coming in, he thought. Time to go down and get to work. He turned to the stairs behind him, headed down to the big assembly room, trying to remain calm as he descended, to prepare his face for the coming encounter. 
    They have tried to take the life of my son!
    The men were already boiling in from the field when he reached the yellow-domed room. They carried their spacebags over their shoulders, shouting and roistering like students returning from vacation.
    "Hey! Feel that under your dogs? That's gravity, man!" "How many G's does this place pull? Feels heavy." "Nine-tenths of a G by the book." 
    The crossfire of thrown words filled the big room.
    "Did you get a good look at this hole on the way down? Where's all the loot this place's supposed to have?" "The Harkonnens took it with 'em!" "Me for a hot shower and a soft bed!" "Haven't you heard, stupid? No showers down here. You scrub your ass with sand!" "Hey! Can it! The Duke!"
    The Duke stepped out of the stair entry into a suddenly silent room.
    Gurney Halleck strode along at the point of the crowd, bag over one shoulder, the neck of his nine-string baliset clutched in the other hand. They were long-fingered hands with big thumbs, full of tiny movements that drew such delicate music from the baliset.
    The Duke watched Halleck, admiring the ugly lump of a man, noting the glass-splinter eyes with their gleam of savage understanding. Here was a man who lived outside the faufreluches while obeying their every precept. What was it Paul had called him? 
    "Gurney, the valorous."
    Halleck's wispy blond hair trailed across barren spots on his head. His wide mouth was twisted into a pleasant sneer, and the scar of the inkvine whip slashed across his jawline seemed to move with a life of its own. His whole air was of casual, shoulder-set capability. He came up to the Duke, bowed. 
    "Gurney," Leto said.
    "My Lord." He gestured with the baliset toward the men in the room. "This is the last of them. I'd have preferred coming in with the first wave, but . . . "
    "There are still some Harkonnens for you," the Duke said. "Step aside with me, Gurney, where we may talk." 
    "Yours to command, my Lord."
    They moved into an alcove beside a coil-slot water machine while the men stirred restlessly in the big room. Halleck dropped his bag into a corner, kept his grip on the baliset.
    "How many men can you let Hawat have?" the Duke asked. 
    "Is Thufir in trouble. Sire?"
    "He's lost only two agents, but his advance men gave us an excellent line on the entire Harkonnen setup here. If we move fast we may gain a measure of security, the breathing space we require. He wants as many men as you can spare--men who won't balk at a little knife work."
    "I can let him have three hundred of my best," Halleck said. "Where shall I send them?"
    "To the main gate. Hawat has an agent there waiting to take them." 
    "Shall I get about it at once, Sire?"
    "In a moment. We have another problem. The field commandant will hold the shuttle here until dawn on a pretext. The Guild Heighliner that brought us is going on about its business, and the shuttle's supposed to make contact with a cargo ship taking up a load of spice." 
    "Our spice, m'Lord?"
    "Our spice. But the shuttle also will carry some of the spice hunters from the old regime. They've opted to leave with the change of fief and the Judge of the Change is allowing it. These are valuable workers, Gurney, about eight hundred of them. Before the shuttle leaves, you must persuade some of those men to enlist with us." 
    "How strong a persuasion, Sire?"
    "I want their willing cooperation, Gurney. Those men have experience and skills we need. The fact that they're leaving suggests they're not part of the Harkonnen machine. Hawat believes there could be some bad ones planted in the group, but he sees assassins in every shadow."
    "Thufir has found some very productive shadows in his time, m'Lord."
    "And there are some he hasn't found. But I think planting sleepers in this outgoing crowd would show too much imagination for the Harkonnens."
    "Possibly, Sire. Where are these men?"
    "Down on the lower level, in a waiting room. I suggest you go down and play a tune or two to soften their minds, then turn on the pressure. You may offer positions of authority to those who qualify. Offer twenty per cent higher wages than they received under the Harkonnens."
    "No more than that, Sire? I know the Harkonnen pay scales. And to men with their termination pay in their pockets and the wanderlust on them . . . well. Sire, twenty per cent would hardly seem proper inducement to stay."
    Leto spoke impatiently: "Then use your own discretion in particular cases. Just remember that the treasury isn't bottomless. Hold it to twenty per cent whenever you can. We particularly need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men--any with open sand experience."
    "I understand, Sire. 'They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity of the sand.' "
    "A very moving quotation," the Duke said. "Turn your crew over to a lieutenant. Have him give a short drill on water discipline, then bed the men down for the night in the barracks adjoining the field. Field personnel will direct them. And don't forget the men for Hawat."
    "Three hundred of the best, Sire." He took up his spacebag. "Where shall I report to you when I've completed my chores?" 
    "I've taken over a council room topside here. We'll hold staff there. I want to arrange a new planetary dispersal order with armored squads going out first."
    Halleck stopped in the act of turning away, caught Leto's eye. "Are you anticipating that kind of trouble, Sire? I thought there was a Judge of the Change here."
    "Both open battle and secret," the Duke said. "There'll be blood aplenty spilled here before we're through." 
    " 'And the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land,' " Halleck quoted. 
    The Duke sighed. "Hurry back, Gurney."
    "Very good, m'Lord." The whipscar rippled to his grin. " 'Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.' " He turned, strode to the center of the room, paused to relay his orders, hurried on through the men.
    Leto shook his head at the retreating back. Halleck was a continual amazement--a head full of songs, quotations, and flowery phrases . . . and the heart of an assassin when it came to dealing with the Harkonnens.
    Presently, Leto took a leisurely diagonal course across to the lift, acknowledging salutes with a casual hand wave. He recognized a propaganda corpsman, stopped to give him a message that could be relayed to the men through channels: those who had brought their women would want to know the women were safe and where they could be found. The others would wish to know that the population here appeared to boast more women than men.
    The Duke slapped the propaganda man on the arm, a signal that the message had top priority to be put out immediately, then continued across the room. He nodded to the men, smiled, traded pleasantries with a subaltern.
    Command must always look confident, he thought. All that faith riding on your shoulders while you sit in the critical seat and never show it.
    He breathed a sigh of relief when the lift swallowed him and he could turn and face the impersonal doors.
    They have tried to take the life of my son!

Over the exit of the Arrakeen landing field, crudely carved as though with a poor instrument, there was an inscription that Muad'Dib was to repeat many times. He saw it that first night on Arrakis, having been brought to the ducal command post to participate in his father's first full staff conference. The words of the inscription were a plea to those leaving Arrakis, but they fell with dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped a close brush with death. They said: "O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers. "
-from "Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    "The whole theory of warfare is calculated risk," the Duke said, "but when it comes to risking your own family, the element of calculation gets submerged in . . . other things." 
    He knew he wasn't holding in his anger as well as he should, and he turned, strode down the length of the long table and back.
    The Duke and Paul were alone in the conference room at the landing field. It was an empty-sounding room, furnished only with the long table, old-fashioned three-legged chairs around it, and a map board and projector at one end. Paul sat at the table near the map board. He had told his father the experience with the hunter-seeker and given the reports that a traitor threatened him.
    The Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: "Hawat told me that house was secure!"
    Paul spoke hesitantly: "I was angry, too--at first. And I blamed Hawat. But the threat came from outside the house. It was simple, clever, and direct. And it would've succeeded were it not for the training given me by you and many others--including Hawat." 
    "Are you defending him?" the Duke demanded. 
    "Yes." 
    "He's getting old. That's it. He should be--"
    "He's wise with much experience," Paul said. "How many of Hawat's mistakes can you recall?"
    "I should be the one defending him," the Duke said. "Not you." 
    Paul smiled.
    Leto sat down at the head of the table, put a hand over his son's. "You've . . . matured lately, Son." He lifted his hand. "It gladdens me." He matched his son's smile. "Hawat will punish himself. He'll direct more anger against himself over this than both of us together could pour on him."
    Paul glanced toward the darkened windows beyond the map board, looked at the night's blackness. Room lights reflected from a balcony railing out there. He saw movement and recognized the shape of a guard in Atreides uniform. Paul looked back at the white wall behind his father, then down to the shiny surface of the table, seeing his own hands clenched into fists there.
    The door opposite the Duke banged open. Thufir Hawat strode through it looking older and more leathery than ever. He paced down the length of the table, stopped at attention facing Leto.
    "My Lord," he said, speaking to a point over Leto's head, "I have just learned how I failed you. It becomes necessary that I tender my resig--"
    "Oh, sit down and stop acting the fool," the Duke said. He waved to the chair across from Paul. "If you made a mistake, it was in overestimating the Harkonnens. Their simple minds came up with a simple trick. We didn't count on simple tricks. And my son has been at great pains to point out to me that he came through this largely because of your training. You didn't fail there!" He tapped the back of the empty chair. "Sit down, I say!" 
    Hawat sank into the chair. "But--"
    "I'll hear no more of it," the Duke said. "The incident is past. We have more pressing business. Where are the others?" 
    "I asked them to wait outside while I--" 
    "Call them in." 
    Hawat looked into Leto's eyes. "Sire, I--"
    "I know who my true friends are, Thufir," the Duke said. "Call in the men."
    Hawat swallowed. "At once, my Lord." He swiveled in the chair, called to the open door: "Gurney, bring them in." 
    Halleck led the file of men into the room, the staff officers looking grimly serious followed by the younger aides and specialists, an air of eagerness among them. Brief scuffing sounds echoed around the room as the men took seats. A faint smell of rachag stimulant wafted down the table.
    "There's coffee for those who want it," the Duke said.
    He looked over his men, thinking: They're a good crew. A man could do far worse for this kind of war. He waited while coffee was brought in from the adjoining room and served, noting the tiredness in some of the faces.
    Presently, he put on his mask of quiet efficiency, stood up and commanded their attention with a knuckle rap against the table.
    "Well, gentlemen," he said, "our civilization appears to've fallen so deeply into the habit of invasion that we cannot even obey a simple order of the Imperium without the old ways cropping up." 
    Dry chuckles sounded around the table, and Paul realized that his father had said the precisely correct thing in precisely the correct tone to lift the mood here. Even the hint of fatigue in his voice was right.
    "I think first we'd better learn if Thufir has anything to add to his report on the Fremen," the Duke said. "Thufir?" 
    Hawat glanced up. "I've some economic matters to go into after my general report, Sire, but I can say now that the Fremen appear more and more to be the allies we need. They're waiting now to see if they can trust us, but they appear to be dealing openly. They've sent us a gift--stillsuits of their own manufacture . . . maps of certain desert areas surrounding strongpoints the Harkonnens left behind, . . ." He glanced down at the table. "Their intelligence reports have proved completely reliable and have helped us considerably in our dealings with the Judge of the Change. They've also sent some incidental things--jewelry for the Lady Jessica, spice liquor, candy, medicinals. My men are processing the lot right now. There appears to be no trickery." 
    "You like these people, Thufir?" asked a man down the table.
    Hawat turned to face his questioner. "Duncan Idaho says they're to be admired."
    Paul glanced at his father, back to Hawat, ventured a question: "Have you any new information on how many Fremen there are?" 
    Hawat looked at Paul. "From food processing and other evidence, Idaho estimates the cave complex he visited consisted of some ten thousand people, all told. Their leader said he ruled a sietch of two thousand hearths. We've reason to believe there are a great many such sietch communities. All seem to give their allegiance to someone called Liet." 
    "That's something new," Leto said.
    "It could be an error on my part, Sire. There are things to suggest this Liet may be a local deity."
    Another man down the table cleared his throat, asked: "Is it certain they deal with the smugglers?"
    "A smuggler caravan left this sietch while Idaho was there, carrying a heavy load of spice. They used pack beasts and indicated they faced an eighteen-day journey."
    "It appears," the Duke said, "that the smugglers have redoubled their operations during this period of unrest. This deserves some careful thought. We shouldn't worry too much about unlicensed frigates working off our planet--it's always done. But to have them completely outside our observation--that's not good." 
    "You have a plan. Sire," Hawat asked.
    The Duke looked at Halleck. "Gurney, I want you to head a delegation, an embassy if you will, to contact these romantic businessmen. Tell them I'll ignore their operations as long as they give me a ducal tithe. Hawat here estimates that graft and extra fighting men heretofore required in their operations have been costing them four times that amount."
    "What if the Emperor gets wind of this?" Halleck asked. "He's very jealous of his CHOAM profits, m'Lord."
    Leto smiled. "We'll bank the entire tithe openly in the name of Shaddam IV and deduct it legally from our levy support costs. Let the Harkonnens fight that! And we'll be ruining a few more of the locals who grew fat under the Harkonnen system. No more graft!" 
    A grin twisted Halleck's face. "Ahh, m'Lord, a beautiful low blow. Would that I could see the Baron's face when he learns of this."
    The Duke turned to Hawat. "Thufir, did you get those account books you said you could buy?"
    "Yes, my Lord. They're being examined in detail even now. I've skimmed them, though, and can give a first approximation." 
    "Give it, then."
    "The Harkonnens took ten billion Solaris out of here every three hundred and thirty Standard days."
    A muted gasp ran around the table. Even the younger aides, who had been betraying some boredom, sat up straighter and exchanged wide-eyed looks.
    Halleck murmured: " 'For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of the treasure hid in the sand.' "
    "You see, gentlemen," Leto said. "Is there anyone here so naive he believes the Harkonnens have quietly packed up and walked away from all this merely because the Emperor ordered it?" 
    There was a general shaking of heads, murmurous agreement.
    "We will have to take it at the point of the sword," Leto said. He turned to Hawat. "This'd be a good point to report on equipment. How many sandcrawlers, harvesters, spice factories, and supporting equipment have they left us?"
    "A full complement, as it says in the Imperial inventory audited by the Judge of the Change, my Lord," Hawat said. He gestured for an aide to pass him a folder, opened the folder on the table in front of him. "They neglect to mention that less than half the crawlers are operable, that only about a third have carryalls to fly them to spice sands--that everything the Harkonnens left us is ready to break down and fall apart. We'll be lucky to get half the equipment into operation and luckier yet if a fourth of it's still working six months from now."
    "Pretty much as we expected," Leto said. "What's the firm estimate on basic equipment?"
    Hawat glanced at his folder. "About nine hundred and thirty harvester-factories that can be sent out in a few days. About sixty-two hundred and fifty ornithopters for survey, scouting, and weather observation . . . carryalls, a little under a thousand." 
    Halleck said: "Wouldn't it be cheaper to reopen negotiations with the Guild for permission to orbit a frigate as a weather satellite?" 
    The Duke looked at Hawat. "Nothing new there, eh, Thufir?" 
    "We must pursue other avenues for now," Hawat said. "The Guild agent wasn't really negotiating with us. He was merely making it plain--one Mentat to another--that the price was out of our reach and would remain so no matter how long a reach we develop. Our task is to find out why before we approach him again."
    One of Halleck's aides down the table swiveled in his chair, snapped: "There's no justice in this!"
    "Justice?" The Duke looked at the man. "Who asks for justice? We make our own justice. We make it here on Arrakis--win or die, Do you regret casting your lot with us, sir?"
    The man stared at the Duke, then: "No, Sire. You couldn't turn and I could do nought but follow you. Forgive the outburst, but . . ." He shrugged. " . . . we must all feel bitter at times." 
    "Bitterness I understand," the Duke said. "But let us not rail about justice as long as we have arms and the freedom to use them. Do any of the rest of you harbor bitterness? If so, let it out. This is friendly council where any man may speak his mind." 
    Halleck stirred, said: "I think what rankles, Sire, is that we've had no volunteers from the other Great Houses. They address you as 'Leto the Just' and promise eternal friendship, but only as long as it doesn't cost them anything."
    "They don't know yet who's going to win this exchange," the Duke said. "Most of the Houses have grown fat by taking few risks. One cannot truly blame them for this; one can only despise them." He looked at Hawat. "We were discussing equipment. Would you care to project a few examples to familiarize the men with this machinery?" 
    Hawat nodded, gestured to an aide at the projector.
    A solido tri-D projection appeared on the table surface about a third of the way down from the Duke. Some of the men farther along the table stood up to get a better look at it. 
    Paul leaned forward, staring at the machine.
    Scaled against the tiny projected human figures around it, the thing was about one hundred and twenty meters long and about forty meters wide. It was basically a long, bug-like body moving on independent sets of wide tracks.
    "This is a harvester factory," Hawat said. "We chose one in good repair for this projection. There's one dragline outfit that came in with the first team of Imperial ecologists, though, and it's still running . . . although I don't know how . . . or why." 
    "If that's the one they call 'Old Maria,' it belongs in a museum," an aide said. "I think the Harkonnens kept it as a punishment job, a threat hanging over their workers' heads. Be good or you'll be assigned to 'Old Maria.' "
    Chuckles sounded around the table.
    Paul held himself apart from the humor, his attention focused on the projection and the question that filled his mind. He pointed to the image on the table, said: "Thufir, are there sandworms big enough to swallow that whole?"
    Quick silence settled on the table. The Duke cursed under his breath, then thought: No--they have to face the realities here.
    "There're worms in the deep desert could take this entire factory in one gulp," Hawat said. "Up here closer to the Shield Wall where most of the spicing's done there are plenty of worms that could cripple this factory and devour it at their leisure." 
    "Why don't we shield them?" Paul asked.
    "According to Idaho's report," Hawat said, "shields are dangerous in the desert. A body-size shield will call every worm for hundreds of meters around. It appears to drive them into a killing frenzy. We've the Fremen word on this and no reason to doubt it. Idaho saw no evidence of shield equipment at the sietch." 
    "None at all?" Paul asked.
    "It'd be pretty hard to conceal that kind of thing among several thousand people," Hawat said. "Idaho had free access to every part of the sietch. He saw no shields or any indication of their use." 
    "It's a puzzle," the Duke said.
    "The Harkonnens certainly used plenty of shields here," Hawat said. "They had repair depots in every garrison village, and their accounts show a heavy expenditure for shield replacements and parts."
    "Could the Fremen have a way of nullifying shields?" Paul asked.
    "It doesn't seem likely," Hawat said. "It's theoretically possible, of course--a shire-sized static counter charge is supposed to do the trick, but no one's ever been able to put it to the test." 
    "We'd have heard about it before now," Halleck said. "The smugglers have close contact with the Fremen and would've acquired such a device if it were available. And they'd have had no inhibitions against marketing it off planet."
    "I don't like an unanswered question of this importance," Leto said. "Thufir, I want you to give top priority to solution of this problem."
    "We're already working on it, my Lord." He cleared his throat. "Ah-h, Idaho did say one thing: he said you couldn't mistake the Fremen attitude toward shields. He said they were mostly amused by them."
    The Duke frowned, then: "The subject under discussion is spicing equipment."
    Hawat gestured to his aide at the projector.
    The solido-image of the harvester-factory was replaced by a projection of a winged device that dwarfed the images of human figures around it. "This is a carryall," Hawat said. "It's essentially a large 'thopter, whose sole function is to deliver a factory to spice-rich sands, then to rescue the factory when a sandworm appears. They always appear. Harvesting the spice is a process of getting in and getting out with as much as possible." 
    "Admirably suited to Harkonnen morality," the Duke said. 
    Laughter was abrupt and too loud.
    An ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus.
    "These 'thopters are fairly conventional," Hawat said. "Major modifications give them extended range. Extra care has been used in sealing essential areas against sand and dust. Only about one in thirty is shielded--possibly discarding the shield generator's weight for greater range."
    "I don't like this de-emphasis on shields," the Duke muttered. And he thought: Is this the Harkonnen secret? Does it mean we won't even be able to escape on shielded frigates if all goes against us? He shook his head sharply to drive out such thoughts, said: "Let's get to the working estimate. What'll our profit figure be?"
    Hawat turned two pages in his notebook. "After assessing the repairs and operable equipment, we've worked out a first estimate on operating costs. It's based naturally on a depreciated figure for a clear safety margin." He closed his eyes in Mentat semitrance, said: "Under the Harkonnens, maintenance and salaries were held to fourteen per cent. We'll be lucky to make it at thirty per cent at first. With reinvestment and growth factors accounted for, including the CHOAM percentage and military costs, our profit margin will be reduced to a very narrow six or seven per cent until we can replace worn-out equipment. We then should be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per cent where it belongs." He opened his eyes. "Unless my Lord wishes to adopt Harkonnen methods." 
    "We're working for a solid and permanent planetary base," the Duke said. "We have to keep a large percentage of the people happy--especially the Fremen." 
    "Most especially the Fremen," Hawat agreed.
    "Our supremacy on Caladan," the Duke said, "depended on sea and air power. Here, we must develop something I choose to call desert power. This may include air power, but it's possible it may not. I call your attention to the lack of 'thopter shields." He shook his head. "The Harkonnens relied on turnover from off planet for some of their key personnel. We don't dare. Each new lot would have its quota of provocateurs."
    "Then we'll have to be content with far less profit and a reduced harvest," Hawat said. "Our output the first two seasons should be down a third from the Harkonnen average."
    "There it is," the Duke said, "exactly as we expected. We'll have to move fast with the Fremen. I'd like five full battalions of Fremen troops before the first CHOAM audit." 
    "That's not much time, Sire," Hawat said.
    "We don't have much time, as you well know. They'll be here with Sardaukar disguised as Harkonnens at the first opportunity. How many do you think they'll ship in, Thufir?" 
    "Four or five battalions all told, Sire. No more. Guild troop-transport costs being what they are."
    "Then five battalions of Fremen plus our own forces ought to do it. Let us have a few captive Sardaukar to parade in front of the Landsraad Council and matters will be much different--profits or no profits." 
    "We'll do our best, Sire."
    Paul looked at his father, back to Hawat, suddenly conscious of the Mentat's great age, aware that the old man had served three generations of Atreides. Aged. It showed in the rheumy shine of the brown eyes, in the cheeks cracked and burned by exotic weathers, in the rounded curve of the shoulders and the thin set of his lips with the cranberry-colored stain of sapho juice.
    So much depends on one aged man, Paul thought.
    "We're presently in a war of assassins," the Duke said, "but it has not achieved full scale. Thufir, what's the condition of the Harkonnen machine here?"
    "We've eliminated two hundred and fifty-nine of their key people, my Lord. No more than three Harkonnen cells remain--perhaps a hundred people in all."
    "These Harkonnen creatures you eliminated," the Duke said, "were they propertied?" 
    "Most were well situated, my Lord--in the entrepreneur class." 
    "I want you to forge certificates of allegiance over the signatures of each of them," the Duke said. "File copies with the Judge of the Change. We'll take the legal position that they stayed under false allegiance. Confiscate their property, take everything, turn out their families, strip them. And make sure the Crown gets its ten per cent. It must be entirely legal."
    Thufir smiled, revealing red-stained teeth beneath the carmine lips. "A move worthy of your grandsire, my Lord. It shames me I didn't think of it first."
    Halleck frowned across the table, surprised a deep scowl on Paul's face. The others were smiling and nodding.
    It's wrong, Paul thought. This'll only make the others fight all the harder. They've nothing to gain by surrendering.
    He knew the actual no-holds-barred convention that ruled in kanly, but this was the sort of move that could destroy them even as it gave them victory.
    " 'I have been a stranger in a strange land,' " Halleck quoted.
    Paul stared at him, recognizing the quotation from the O.C. Bible, wondering: Does Gurney, too, wish an end to devious plots?
    The Duke glanced at the darkness out the windows, looked back at Halleck. "Gurney, how many of those sandworkers did you persuade to stay with us?"
    "Two hundred eighty-six in all, Sire. I think we should take them and consider ourselves lucky. They're all in useful categories." 
    "No more?" The Duke pursed his lips, then: "Well, pass the word along to--"
    A disturbance at the door interrupted him. Duncan Idaho came through the guard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Duke's ear.
    Leto waved him back, said: "Speak out, Duncan. You can see this is strategy staff."
    Paul studied Idaho, marking the feline movements, the swiftness of reflex that made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate. Idaho's dark round face turned toward Paul, the cave-sitter eyes giving no hint of recognition, but Paul recognized the mask of serenity over excitement.
    Idaho looked down the length of the table, said: "We've taken a force of Harkonnen mercenaries disguised as Fremen. The Fremen themselves sent us a courier to warn of the false band. In the attack, however, we found the Harkonnens had waylaid the Fremen courier--badly wounded him. We were bringing him here for treatment by our medics when he died. I'd seen how badly off the man was and stopped to do what I could. I surprised him in the attempt to throw something away." Idaho glanced down at Leto. "A knife, m'Lord, a knife the like of which you've never seen." 
    "Crysknife?" someone asked.
    "No doubt of it," Idaho said. "Milky white and glowing with a light of its own like." He reached into his tunic, brought out a sheath with a black-ridged handle protruding from it.
    "Keep that blade in its sheath!"
    The voice came from the open door at the end of the room, a vibrant and penetrating voice that brought them all up, staring.
    A tall, robed figure stood in the door, barred by the crossed swords of the guard. A light tan robe completely enveloped the man except for a gap in the hood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blue--no white in them at all. 
    "Let him enter," Idaho whispered. 
    "Pass that man," the Duke said.
    The guards hesitated, then lowered their swords. 
    The man swept into the room, stood across from the Duke.
    "This is Stilgar, chief of the sietch I visited, leader of those who warned us of the false band," Idaho said.
    "Welcome, sir," Leto said. "And why shouldn't we unsheath this blade?"
    Stilgar glanced at Idaho, said: "You observed the customs of cleanliness and honor among us. I would permit you to see the blade of the man you befriended." His gaze swept the others in the room. "But I do not know these others. Would you have them defile an honorable weapon?"
    "I am the Duke Leto," the Duke said. "Would you permit me to see this blade?"
    "I'll permit you to earn the right to unsheath it," Stilgar said, and, as a mutter of protest sounded around the table, he raised a thin, darkly veined hand. "I remind you this is the blade of one who befriended you."
    In the waiting silence, Paul studied the man, sensing the aura of power that radiated from him. He was a leader--a Fremen leader.
    A man near the center of the table across from Paul muttered: "Who's he to tell us what rights we have on Arrakis?" 
    "It is said that the Duke Leto Atreides rules with the consent of the governed," the Fremen said. "Thus I must tell you the way it is with us: a certain responsibility falls on those who have seen a crysknife." He passed a dark glance across Idaho. "They are ours. They may never leave Arrakis without our consent." 
    Halleck and several of the others started to rise, angry expressions on their faces. Halleck said: "The Duke Leto determines whether--"
    "One moment, please," Leto said, and the very mildness of his voice held them. This must not get out of hand, he thought. He addressed himself to the Fremen: "Sir, I honor and respect the personal dignity of any man who respects my dignity. I am indeed indebted to you. And I always pay my debts. If it is your custom that this knife remain sheathed here, then it is so ordered--by me. And if there is any other way we may honor the man who died in our service, you have but to name it."
    The Fremen stared at the Duke, then slowly pulled aside his veil, revealing a thin nose and full-lipped mouth in a glistening black beard. Deliberately he bent over the end of the table, spat on its polished surface.
    As the men around the table started to surge to their feet, Idaho's voice boomed across the room: "Hold!"
    Into the sudden charged stillness, Idaho said: "We thank you, Stilgar, for the gift of your body's moisture. We accept it in the spirit with which it is given." And Idaho spat on the table in front of the Duke.
    Aside to the Duke, he said; "Remember how precious water is here, Sire. That was a token of respect."
    Leto sank back into his own chair, caught Paul's eye, a rueful grin on his son's face, sensed the slow relaxation of tension around the table as understanding came to his men.
    The Fremen looked at Idaho, said: "You measured well in my sietch, Duncan Idaho. Is there a bond on your allegiance to your Duke?" 
    "He's asking me to enlist with him. Sire," Idaho said. 
    "Would he accept a dual allegiance?" Leto asked. 
    "You wish me to go with him, Sire?"
    "I wish you to make your own decision in the matter," Leto said, and he could not keep the urgency out of his voice.
    Idaho studied the Fremen. "Would you have me under these conditions, Stilgar? There'd be times when I'd have to return to serve my Duke."
    "You fight well and you did your best for our friend," Stilgar said. He looked at Leto. "Let it be thus: the man Idaho keeps the crysknife he holds as a mark of his allegiance to us. He must be cleansed, of course, and the rites observed, but this can be done. He will be Fremen and soldier of the Atreides. There is precedent for this: Liet serves two masters." 
    "Duncan?" Leto asked.
    "I understand, Sire," Idaho said. 
    "It is agreed, then," Leto said.
    "Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho." Stilgar said. "The body of our friend remains with your Duke. His water is Atreides water. It is a bond between us."
    Leto sighed, glanced at Hawat, catching the old Mentat's eye. Hawat nodded, his expression pleased.
    "I will await below," Stilgar said, "while Idaho makes farewell with his friends. Turok was the name of our dead friend. Remember that when it comes time to release his spirit. You are friends of Turok." 
    Stilgar started to turn away.
    "Will you not stay a while?" Leto asked.
    The Fremen turned back, whipping his veil into place with a casual gesture, adjusting something beneath it. Paul glimpsed what looked like a thin tube before the veil settled into place. 
    "Is there reason to stay?" the Fremen asked. 
    "We would honor you," the Duke said.
    "Honor requires that I be elsewhere soon," the Fremen said. He shot another glance at Idaho, whirled, and strode out past the door guards.
    "If the other Fremen match him, we'll serve each other well," Leto said.
    Idaho spoke in a dry voice: "He's a fair sample, Sire." 
    "You understand what you're to do, Duncan?" 
    "I'm your ambassador to the Fremen, Sire."
    "Much depends on you, Duncan. We're going to need at least five battalions of those people before the Sardaukar descend on us."
    "This is going to take some doing, Sire. The Fremen are a pretty independent bunch." Idaho hesitated, then: "And, Sire, there's one other thing. One of the mercenaries we knocked over was trying to get this blade from our dead Fremen friend. The mercenary says there's a Harkonnen reward of a million Solaris for anyone who'll bring in a single crysknife."
    Leto's chin came up in a movement of obvious surprise. "Why do they want one of those blades so badly?"
    "The knife is ground from a sandworm's tooth; it's the mark of the Fremen, Sire. With it, a blue-eyed man could penetrate any sietch in the land. They'd question me unless I were known. I don't look Fremen. But . . . " 
    "Piter de Vries," the Duke said.
    "A man of devilish cunning, my Lord," Hawat said. 
    Idaho slipped the sheathed knife beneath his tunic. 
    "Guard that knife," the Duke said.
    "I understand, m'Lord." He patted the transceiver on his belt kit. "I'll report soon as possible. Thufir has my call code. Use battle language." He saluted, spun about, and hurried after the Fremen.
    They heard his footsteps drumming down the corridor.
    A look of understanding passed between Leto and Hawat. They smiled.
    "We've much to do, Sire," Halleck said. 
    "And I keep you from your work," Leto said.
    "I have the report on the advance bases," Hawat said. "Shall I give it another time, Sire?" 
    "Will it take long?"
    "Not for a briefing. It's said among the Fremen that there were more than two hundred of these advance bases built here on Arrakis during the Desert Botanical Testing Station period. All supposedly have been abandoned, but there are reports they were sealed off before being abandoned." 
    "Equipment in them?" the Duke asked. 
    "According to the reports I have from Duncan." 
    "Where are they located?" Halleck asked.
    "The answer to that question," Hawat said, "is invariably: 'Liet knows.' " 
    "God knows," Leto muttered.
    "Perhaps not. Sire," Hawat said. "You heard this Stilgar use the name. Could he have been referring to a real person?" 
    "Serving two masters," Halleck said. "It sounds like a religious quotation." 
    "And you should know," the Duke said. 
    Halleck smiled.
    "This Judge of the Change," Leto said, "the Imperial ecologist--Kynes . . . Wouldn't he know where those bases are?" 
    "Sire," Hawat cautioned, "this Kynes is an Imperial servant." 
    "And he's a long way from the Emperor," Leto said. "I want those bases. They'd be loaded with materials we could salvage and use for repair of our working equipment."
    "Sire!" Hawat said. "Those bases are still legally His Majesty's fief."
    "The weather here's savage enough to destroy anything," the Duke said. "We can always blame the weather. Get this Kynes and at least find out if the bases exist."
    " 'Twere dangerous to commandeer them," Hawat said. "Duncan was clear on one thing: those bases or the idea of them hold some deep significance for the Fremen. We might alienate the Fremen if we took those bases."
    Paul looked at the faces of the men around them, saw the intensity of the way they followed every word. They appeared deeply disturbed by his father's attitude.
    "Listen to him, Father," Paul said in a low voice. "He speaks truth."
    "Sire," Hawat said, "those bases could give us material to repair every piece of equipment left us, yet be beyond reach for strategic reasons. It'd be rash to move without greater knowledge. This Kynes has arbiter authority from the Imperium. We mustn't forget that. And the Fremen defer to him."
    "Do it gently, then," the Duke said. "I wish to know only if those bases exist." 
    "As you will, Sire." Hawat sat back, lowered his eyes.
    "All right, then," the Duke said. "We know what we have ahead of us--work. We've been trained for it. We've some experience in it. We know what the rewards are and the alternatives are clear enough. You all have your assignments." He looked at Halleck. "Gurney, take care of that smuggler situation first." 
    " 'I shall go unto the rebellious that dwell in the dry land,' " Halleck intoned.
    "Someday I'll catch that man without a quotation and he'll look undressed," the Duke said.
    Chuckles echoed around the table, but Paul heard the effort in them.
    The Duke turned to Hawat. "Set up another command post for intelligence and communications on this floor, Thufir. When you have them ready, I'll want to see you."
    Hawat arose, glanced around the room as though seeking support. He turned away, led the procession out of the room. The others moved hurriedly, scraping their chairs on the floor, balling up in little knots of confusion.
    It ended up in confusion, Paul thought, staring at the backs of the last men to leave. Always before, Staff had ended on an incisive air. This meeting had just seemed to trickle out, worn down by its own inadequacies, and with an argument to top it off.
    For the first time, Paul allowed himself to think about the real possibility of defeat--not thinking about it out of fear or because of warnings such as that of the old Reverend Mother, but facing up to it because of his own assessment of the situation.
    My father is desperate, he thought. Things aren't going well for us at all.
    And Hawat--Paul recalled how the old Mentat had acted during the conference--subtle hesitations, signs of unrest. 
    Hawat was deeply troubled by something.
    "Best you remain here the rest of the night, Son," the Duke said. "It'll be dawn soon, anyway. I'll inform your mother." He got to his feet, slowly, stiffly. "Why don't you pull a few of these chairs together and stretch out on them for some rest." 
    "I'm not very tired, sir." 
    "As you will."
    The Duke folded his hands behind him, began pacing up and down the length of the table.
    Like a caged animal, Paul thought.
    "Are you going to discuss the traitor possibility with Hawat?" Paul asked.
    The Duke stopped across from his son, spoke to the dark windows. "We've discussed the possibility many times." 
    "The old woman seemed so sure of herself," Paul said. "And the message Mother--"
    "Precautions have been taken," the Duke said. He looked around the room, and Paul marked the hunted wildness in his father's eyes. "Remain here. There are some things about the command posts I want to discuss with Thufir." He turned, strode out of the room, nodding shortly to the door guards.
    Paul stared at the place where his father had stood. The space had been empty even before the Duke left the room. And he recalled the old woman's warning: " . . . for the father, nothing."

On that first day when Muad'Dib rode through the streets of Arrakeen with his family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: "Mahdi!" But their shout was more a question than a statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib.
-from "Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    The Duke found Thufir Hawat alone in the corner room to which a guard directed him. There was the sound of men setting up communications equipment in an adjoining room, but this place was fairly quiet. The Duke glanced around as Hawat arose from a paper-cluttered table. It was a green-walled enclosure with, in addition to the table, three suspensor chairs from which the Harkonnen "H" had been hastily removed, leaving an imperfect color patch.
    "The chairs are liberated but quite safe," Hawat said. "Where is Paul, Sire?"
    "I left him in the conference room. I'm hoping he'll get some rest without me there to distract him."
    Hawat nodded, crossed to the door to the adjoining room, closed it, shutting off the noise of static and electronic sparking.
    "Thufir," Leto said, "the Imperial and Harkonnen stockpiles of spice attract my attention." 
    "M'Lord?"
    The Duke pursed his lips. "Storehouses are susceptible to destruction." He raised a hand as Hawat started to speak. "Ignore the Emperor's hoard. He'd secretly enjoy it if the Harkonnens were embarrassed. And can the Baron object if something is destroyed which he cannot openly admit that he has?" 
    Hawat shook his head. "We've few men to spare. Sire." 
    "Use some of Idaho's men. And perhaps some of the Fremen would enjoy a trip off planet. A raid on Giedi Prime--there are tactical advantages to such a diversion, Thufir."
    "As you say, my Lord." Hawat turned away, and the Duke saw evidence of nervousness in the old man, thought: Perhaps he suspects I distrust him. He must know I've private reports of traitors. Well--best quiet his fears immediately.
    "Thufir," he said, "since you're one of the few I can trust completely, there's another matter bears discussion. We both know how constant a watch we must keep to prevent traitors from infiltrating our forces . . . but I have two new reports." 
    Hawat turned, stared at him.
    And Leto repeated the stories Paul had brought.
    Instead of bringing on the intense Mentat concentration, the reports only increased Hawat's agitation.
    Leto studied the old man and, presently, said: "You've been holding something back, old friend. I should've suspected when you were so nervous during Staff. What is it that was too hot to dump in front of the full conference?"
    Hawat's sapho-stained lips were pulled into a prim, straight line with tiny wrinkles radiating into them. They maintained their wrinkled stiffness as he said: "My Lord, I don't quite know how to broach this."
    "We've suffered many a scar for each other, Thufir," the Duke said. "You know you can broach any subject with me." 
    Hawat continued to stare at him, thinking: This is how I like him best. This is the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service. Why must I hurt him?
    "Well?" Leto demanded.
    Hawat shrugged. "It's a scrap of a note. We took it from a Harkonnen courier. The note was intended for an agent named Pardee. We've good reason to believe Pardee was top man in the Harkonnen underground here. The note--it's a thing that could have great consequence or no consequence. It's susceptible to various interpretations." 
    "What's the delicate content of this note?"
    "Scrap of a note, my Lord. Incomplete. It was on minimic film with the usual destruction capsule attached. We stopped the acid action just short of full erasure, leaving only a fragment. The fragment, however, is extremely suggestive." 
    "Yes?"
    Hawat rubbed at his lips. "It says: ' . . . eto will never suspect, and when the blow falls on him from a beloved hand, its source alone should be enough to destroy him.' The note was under the Baron's own seal and I've authenticated the seal." 
    "Your suspicion is obvious," the Duke said and his voice was suddenly cold.
    "I'd sooner cut off my arms than hurt you," Hawat said. "My Lord, what if . . ."
    "The Lady Jessica," Leto said, and he felt anger consuming him. "Couldn't you wring the facts out of this Pardee?" 
    "Unfortunately, Pardee no longer was among the living when we intercepted the courier. The courier, I'm certain, did not know what he carried." 
    "I see."
    Leto shook his head, thinking: What a slimy piece of business. There can't be anything in it. I know my woman. 
    "My Lord, if--" 
    "No!" the Duke barked. "There's a mistake here that--" 
    "We cannot ignore it, my Lord."
    "She's been with me for sixteen years! There've been countless opportunities for--You yourself investigated the school and the woman!" 
    Hawat spoke bitterly: "Things have been known to escape me." 
    "It's impossible, I tell you! The Harkonnens want to destroy the Atreides line--meaning Paul, too. They've already tried once. Could a woman conspire against her own son?"
    "Perhaps she doesn't conspire against her son. And yesterday's attempt could've been a clever sham." 
    "It couldn't have been a sham."
    "Sire, she isn't supposed to know her parentage, but what if she does know? What if she were an orphan, say, orphaned by an Atreides?"
    "She'd have moved long before now. Poison in my drink . . . a stiletto at night. Who has had better opportunity?" 
    "The Harkonnens mean to destroy you, my Lord. Their intent is not just to kill. There's a range of fine distinctions in kanly. This could be a work of art among vendettas."
    The Duke's shoulders slumped. He closed his eyes, looking old and tired. It cannot be, he thought. The woman has opened her heart to me.
    "What better way to destroy me than to sow suspicion of the woman I love?" he asked.
    "An interpretation I've considered," Hawat said. "Still . . . " 
    The Duke opened his eyes, stared at Hawat, thinking: Let him be suspicious. Suspicion is his trade, not mine. Perhaps if I appear to believe this, that will make another man careless. 
    "What do you suggest?" the Duke whispered.
    "For now, constant surveillance, my Lord. She should be watched at all times. I will see it's done unobtrusively. Idaho would be the ideal choice for the job. Perhaps in a week or so we can bring him back. There's a young man we've been training in Idaho's troop who might be ideal to send to the Fremen as a replacement. He's gifted in diplomacy." 
    "Don't jeopardize our foothold with the Fremen." 
    "Of course not, Sire." 
    "And what about Paul?" 
    "Perhaps we could alert Dr. Yueh." 
    Leto turned his back on Hawat. "I leave it in your hands." 
    "I shall use discretion, my Lord."
    At least I can count on that, Leto thought. And he said: "I will take a walk. If you need me, I'll be within the perimeter. The guard can--"
    "My Lord, before you go, I've a filmclip you should read. It's a first-approximation analysis on the Fremen religion. You'll recall you asked me to report on it." 
    The Duke paused, spoke without turning. "Will it not wait?" 
    "Of course, my Lord. You asked what they were shouting, though. It was 'Mahdi!' They directed the term at the young master. When they--" 
    "At Paul?"
    "Yes, my Lord. They've a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom. It follows the familiar messiah pattern." 
    "They think Paul is this . . . this . . . "
    "They only hope, my Lord." Hawat extended a filmclip capsule.
    The Duke accepted it, thrust it into a pocket. "I'll look at it later." 
    "Certainly, my Lord." 
    "Right now, I need time to . . . think." 
    "Yes, my Lord."
    The Duke took a deep sighing breath, strode out the door. He turned to his right down the hall, began walking, hands behind his back, paying little attention to where he was. There were corridors and stairs and balconies and halls . . . people who saluted and stood aside for him.
    In time he came back to the conference room, found it dark and Paul asleep on the table with a guard's robe thrown over him and a ditty pack for a pillow. The Duke walked softly down the length of the room and onto the balcony overlooking the landing field. A guard at the corner of the balcony, recognizing the Duke by the dim reflection of lights from the field, snapped to attention.
    "At ease," the Duke murmured. He leaned against the cold metal of the balcony rail.
    A predawn hush had come over the desert basin. He looked up. Straight overhead, the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blue-black. Low on the southern horizon, the night's second moon peered through a thin dust haze--an unbelieving moon that looked at him with a cynical light.
    As the Duke watched, the moon dipped beneath the Shield Wall cliffs, frosting them, and in the sudden intensity of darkness, he experienced a chill. He shivered. 
    Anger shot through him.
    The Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last time, he thought. They are dung heaps with village provost minds! Here I make my stand! And he thought with a touch of sadness: I must rule with eye and claw--as the hawk among lesser birds. Unconsciously, his hand brushed the hawk emblem on his tunic.
    To the east, the night grew a faggot of luminous gray, then seashell opalescence that dimmed the stars. There came the long, bell-tolling movement of dawn striking across a broken horizon. 
    It was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention. 
    Some things beggar likeness, he thought.
    He had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that shattered red horizon and the purple and ochre cliffs. Beyond the landing field where the night's faint dew had touched life into the hurried seeds of Arrakis, he saw great puddles of red blooms and, running through them, an articulate tread of violet . . . like giant footsteps.
    "It's a beautiful morning. Sire," the guard said. 
    "Yes, it is."
    The Duke nodded, thinking: Perhaps this planet could grow on one. Perhaps it could become a good home for my son.
    Then he saw the human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping them with strange scythe-like devices--dew gatherers. Water so precious, here that even the dew must be collected.
    And it could be a hideous place, the Duke thought.

-from "Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    The Duke said: "Paul, I'm doing a hateful thing, but I must." He stood beside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the conference room for their breakfast. The thing's sensor arms hung limply over the table, reminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead.
    The Duke's attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and its roiling of dust against the morning sky.
    Paul had a viewer in front of him containing a short filmclip on Fremen religious practices. The clip had been compiled by one of Hawat's experts and Paul found himself disturbed by the references to himself.
    "Mahdi!"
    "Lisan al-Gaib!"
    He could close his eyes and recall the shouts of the crowds. So that is what they hope, he thought. And he remembered what the old Reverend Mother had said: Kwisatz Haderach. The memories touched his feelings of terrible purpose, shading this strange world with sensations of familiarity that he could not understand. 
    "A hateful thing," the Duke said. 
    "What do you mean, sir?"
    Leto turned, looked down at his son. "Because the Harkonnens think to trick me by making me distrust your mother. They don't know that I'd sooner distrust myself." 
    "I don't understand, sir."
    Again, Leto looked out the windows. The white sun was well up into its morning quadrant. Milky light picked out a boiling of dust clouds that spilled over into the blind canyons interfingering the Shield Wall.
    Slowly, speaking in a slow voice to contain his anger, the Duke explained to Paul about the mysterious note. 
    "You might just as well mistrust me," Paul said.
    "They have to think they've succeeded," the Duke said. "They must think me this much of a fool. It must look real. Even your mother may not know the sham." 
    "But, sir! Why?"
    "Your mother's response must not be an act. Oh, she's capable of a supreme act . . . but too much rides on this. I hope to smoke out a traitor. It must seem that I've been completely cozened. She must be hurt this way that she does not suffer greater hurt." 
    "Why do you tell me, Father? Maybe I'll give it away." 
    "They'll not watch you in this thing," the Duke said. "You'll keep the secret. You must." He walked to the windows, spoke without turning. "This way, if anything should happen to me, you can tell her the truth--that I never doubted her, not for the smallest instant. I should want her to know this."
    Paul recognized the death thoughts in his father's words, spoke quickly: "Nothing's going to happen to you, sir. The--" 
    "Be silent, Son."
    Paul stared at his father's back, seeing the fatigue in the angle of the neck, in the line of the shoulders, in the slow movements. 
    "You're just tired, Father."
    "I am tired," the Duke agreed. "I'm morally tired. The melancholy degeneration of the Great Houses has afflicted me at last, perhaps. And we were such strong people once." 
    Paul spoke in quick anger: "Our House hasn't degenerated!"
    "Hasn't it?"
    The Duke turned, faced his son, revealing dark circles beneath hard eyes, a cynical twist of mouth. "I should wed your mother, make her my Duchess. Yet . . . my unwedded state gives some Houses hope they may yet ally with me through their marriageable daughters." He shrugged. "So, I . . . " 
    "Mother has explained this to me."
    "Nothing wins more loyalty for a leader than an air of bravura," the Duke said. "I, therefore, cultivate an air of bravura." 
    "You lead well," Paul protested. "You govern well. Men follow you willingly and love you."
    "My propaganda corps is one of the finest," the Duke said. Again, he turned to stare out at the basin. "There's greater possibility for us here on Arrakis than the Imperium could ever suspect. Yet sometimes I think it'd have been better if we'd run for it, gone renegade. Sometimes I wish we could sink back into anonymity among the people, become less exposed to . . . " 
    "Father!"
    "Yes, I am tired," the Duke said. "Did you know we're using spice residue as raw material and already have our own factory to manufacture filmbase?" 
    "Sir?"
    "We mustn't run short of filmbase," the Duke said. "Else, how could we flood village and city with our information? The people must learn how well I govern them. How would they know if we didn't tell them?" 
    "You should get some rest," Paul said.
    Again, the Duke faced his son. "Arrakis has another advantage I almost forgot to mention. Spice is in everything here. You breathe it and eat it in almost everything. And I find that this imparts a certain natural immunity to some of the most common poisons of the Assassins' Handbook. And the need to watch every drop of water puts all food production--yeast culture, hydroponics, chemavit, everything--under the strictest surveillance. We cannot kill off large segments of our population with poison--and we cannot be attacked this way, either. Arrakis makes us moral and ethical." 
    Paul started to speak, but the Duke cut him off, saying: "I have to have someone I can say these things to, Son." He sighed, glanced back at the dry landscape where even the flowers were gone now--trampled by the dew gatherers, wilted under the early sun.
    "On Caladan, we ruled with sea and air power," the Duke said. "Here, we must scrabble for desert power. This is your inheritance, Paul. What is to become of you if anything happens to me? You'll not be a renegade House, but a guerrilla House--running, hunted." 
    Paul groped for words, could find nothing to say. He had never seen his father this despondent.
    "To hold Arrakis," the Duke said, "one is faced with decisions that may cost one his self-respect." He pointed out the window to the Atreides green and black banner hanging limply from a staff at the edge of the landing field. "That honorable banner could come to mean many evil things."
    Paul swallowed in a dry throat. His father's words carried futility, a sense of fatalism that left the boy with an empty feeling in his chest.
    The Duke took an antifatigue tablet from a pocket, gulped it dry. "Power and fear," he said. "The tools of statecraft. I must order new emphasis on guerrilla training for you. That filmclip there--they call you 'Mahdi'--'Lisan al-Gaib'--as a last resort, you might capitalize on that."
    Paul stared at his father, watching the shoulders straighten as the tablet did its work, but remembering the words of fear and doubt.
    "What's keeping that ecologist?" the Duke muttered. "I told Thufir to have him here early."

My father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one day and I sensed in the ways my mother had taught me that he was disturbed. He led me down the Hall of Portraits to the ego-likeness of the Duke Leto Atreides. I marked the strong resemblance between them--my father and this man in the portrait--both with thin, elegant faces and sharp features dominated by cold eyes. "Princess-daughter," my father said, "I would that you'd been older when it came time for this man to choose a woman." My father was 71 at the time and looking no older than the man in the portrait, and I was but 14, yet I remember deducing in that instant that my father secretly wished the Duke had been his son, and disliked the political necessities that made them enemies.
-"In My Father's House" by the Princess Irulan

    His first encounter with the people he had been ordered to betray left Dr. Kynes shaken. He prided himself on being a scientist to whom legends were merely interesting clues, pointing toward cultural roots. Yet the boy fitted the ancient prophecy so precisely. He had "the questing eyes," and the air of "reserved candor." 
    Of course, the prophecy left certain latitude as to whether the Mother Goddess would bring the Messiah with her or produce Him on the scene. Still, there was this odd correspondence between prediction and persons.
    They met in midmorning outside the Arrakeen landing field's administration building. An unmarked ornithopter squatted nearby, humming softly on standby like a somnolent insect. An Atreides guard stood beside it with bared sword and the faint air-distortion of a shield around him.
    Kynes sneered at the shield pattern, thinking: Arrakis has a surprise for them there!
    The planetologist raised a hand, signaled for his Fremen guard to fall back. He strode on ahead toward the building's entrance--the dark hole in plastic-coated rock. So exposed, that monolithic building, he thought. So much less suitable than a cave.
    Movement within the entrance caught his attention. He stopped, taking the moment to adjust his robe and the set of his stillsuit at the left shoulder.
    The entrance doors swung wide. Atreides guards emerged swiftly, all of them heavily armed--slow-pellet stunners, swords and shields. Behind them came a tall man, hawk-faced, dark of skin and hair. He wore a jubba cloak with Atreides crest at the breast, and wore it in a way that betrayed his unfamiliarity with the garment. It clung to the legs of his stillsuit on one side. It lacked a free-swinging, striding rhythm.
    Beside the man walked a youth with the same dark hair, but rounder in the face. The youth seemed small for the fifteen years Kynes knew him to have. But the young body carried a sense of command, a poised assurance, as though he saw and knew things all around him that were not visible to others. And he wore the same style cloak as his father, yet with casual ease that made one think the boy had always worn such clothing.
    "The Mahdi will be aware of things others cannot see," went the prophecy.
    Kynes shook his head, telling himself: They're just people.
    With the two, garbed like them for the desert, came a man Kynes recognized--Gurney Halleck. Kynes took a deep breath to still his resentment against Halleck, who had briefed him on how to behave with the Duke and ducal heir.
    "You may call the Duke 'my Lord ' or 'Sire.' 'Noble Born' also is correct, but usually reserved for more formal occasions. The son may be addressed as 'young Master' or 'my Lord.' The Duke is a man of much leniency, but brooks little familiarity." 
    And Kynes thought as he watched the group approach: They'll learn soon enough who's master on Arrakis. Order me questioned half the night by that Mentat, will they? Expect me to guide them on an inspection of spice mining, do they?
    The import of Hawat's questions had not escaped Kynes. They wanted the Imperial bases. And it was obvious they'd learned of the bases from Idaho.
    I will have Stilgar send Idaho's head to this Duke, Kynes told himself.
    The ducal party was only a few paces away now, their feet in desert boots crunching the sand. 
    Kynes bowed. "My Lord, Duke."
    As he had approached the solitary figure standing near the ornithopter, Leto had studied him: tall, thin, dressed for the desert in loose robe, stillsuit, and low boots. The man's hood was thrown back, its veil hanging to one side, revealing long sandy hair, a sparse beard. The eyes were that fathomless blue-within-blue under thick brows. Remains of dark stains smudged his eye sockets. 
    "You're the ecologist," the Duke said.
    "We prefer the old title here, my Lord," Kynes said. "Planetologist."
    "As you wish," the Duke said. He glanced down at Paul. "Son, this is the Judge of the Change, the arbiter of dispute, the man set here to see that the forms are obeyed in our assumption of power over this fief." He glanced at Kynes. "And this is my son." 
    "My Lord," Kynes said.
    "Are you a Fremen?" Paul asked.
    Kynes smiled. "I am accepted in both sietch and village, young Master. But I am in His Majesty's service, the Imperial Planetologist."
    Paul nodded, impressed by the man's air of strength. Halleck had pointed Kynes out to Paul from an upper window of the administration building: "The man standing there with the Fremen escort--the one moving now toward the ornithopter."
    Paul had inspected Kynes briefly with binoculars, noting the prim, straight mouth, the high forehead. Halleck had spoken in Paul's ear: "Odd sort of fellow. Has a precise way of speaking--clipped off, no fuzzy edges--razor-apt."
    And the Duke, behind them, had said: "Scientist type."
    Now, only a few feet from the man, Paul sensed the power in Kynes, the impact of personality, as though he were blood royal, born to command.
    "I understand we have you to thank for our stillsuits and these cloaks," the Duke said.
    "I hope they fit well, my Lord," Kynes said. "They're of Fremen make and as near as possible the dimensions given me by your man Halleck here."
    "I was concerned that you said you couldn't take us into the desert unless we wore these garments," the Duke said. "We can carry plenty of water. We don't intend to be out long and we'll have air cover--the escort you see overhead right now. It isn't likely we'd be forced down."
    Kynes stared at him, seeing the water-fat flesh. He spoke coldly: "You never talk of likelihoods on Arrakis. You speak only of possibilities."
    Halleck stiffened. "The Duke is to be addressed as my Lord or Sire!"
    Leto gave Halleck their private handsignal to desist, said: "Our ways are new here, Gurney. We must make allowances." 
    "As you wish, Sire."
    "We are indebted to you, Dr. Kynes," Leto said. "These suits and the consideration for our welfare will be remembered." 
    On impulse, Paul called to mind a quotation from the O.C. Bible, said: " 'The gift is the blessing of the river.' "
    The words rang out overloud in the still air. The Fremen escort Kynes had left in the shade of the administration building leaped up from their squatting repose, muttering in open agitation. One cried out: "Lisan al-Gaib!"
    Kynes whirled, gave a curt, chopping signal with a hand, waved the guard away. They fell back, grumbling among themselves, trailed away around the building. 
    "Most interesting," Leto said.
    Kynes passed a hard glare over the Duke and Paul, said: "Most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot. Pay no attention to them. They mean no harm." But he thought of the words of the legend: "They will greet you with Holy Words and your gifts will be a blessing."
    Leto's assessment of Kynes--based partly on Hawat's brief verbal report (guarded and full of suspicions)--suddenly crystallized: the man was Fremen. Kynes had come with a Fremen escort, which could mean simply that the Fremen were testing their new freedom to enter urban areas--but it had seemed an honor guard. And by his manner, Kynes was a proud man, accustomed to freedom, his tongue and his manner guarded only by his own suspicions. Paul's question had been direct and pertinent. 
    Kynes had gone native.
    "Shouldn't we be going, Sire?" Halleck asked.
    The Duke nodded. "I'll fly my own 'thopter. Kynes can sit up front with me to direct me. You and Paul take the rear seats." 
    "One moment, please," Kynes said. "With your permission, Sire, I must check the security of your suits."
    The Duke started to speak, but Kynes pressed on: "I have concern for my own flesh as well as yours . . . my Lord. I'm well aware of whose throat would be slit should harm befall you two while you're in my care."
    The Duke frowned, thinking: How delicate this moment! If I refuse, it may offend him. And this could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure. Yet . . . to let him inside my shield, touching my person when I know so little about him?
    The thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels. "We're in your hands," the Duke said. He stepped forward, opening his robe, saw Halleck come up on the balls of his feet, poised and alert, but remaining where he was. "And, if you'd be so kind," the Duke said, "I'd appreciate an explanation of the suit from one who lives so intimately with it."
    "Certainly," Kynes said. He felt up under the robe for the shoulder seals, speaking as he examined the suit. "It's basically a micro-sandwich--a high-efficiency filter and heat-exchange system." He adjusted the shoulder seals. "The skin-contact layer's porous. Perspiration passes through it, having cooled the body . . . near-normal evaporation process. The next two layers . . . " Kynes tightened the chest fit. ". . . include heat exchange filaments and salt precipitators. Salt's reclaimed." 
    The Duke lifted his arms at a gesture, said: "Most interesting." 
    "Breathe deeply," Kynes said. 
    The Duke obeyed.
    Kynes studied the underarm seals, adjusted one. "Motions of the body, especially breathing," he said, "and some osmotic action provide the pumping force." He loosened the chest fit slightly. "Reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck."
    The Duke twisted his chin in and down to look at the end of the tube. "Efficient and convenient," he said. "Good engineering." 
    Kynes knelt, examined the leg seals. "Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads," he said, and stood up, felt the neck fitting, lifted a sectioned flap there. "In the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this tube in the nostrils with these plugs to insure a tight fit. Breathe in through the mouth filter, out through the nose tube. With a Fremen suit in good working order, you won't lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day--even if you're caught in the Great Erg." 
    "A thimbleful a day," the Duke said.
    Kynes pressed a finger against the suit's forehead pad, said: "This may rub a little. It if irritates you, please tell me. I could slit-patch it a bit tighter."
    "My thanks," the Duke said. He moved his shoulders in the suit as Kynes stepped back, realizing that it did feel better now--tighter and less irritating.
    Kynes turned to Paul. "Now, let's have a look at you, lad." 
    A good man but he'll have to learn to address us properly, the Duke thought.
    Paul stood passively as Kynes inspected the suit. It had been an odd sensation putting on the crinkling, slick-surfaced garment. In his foreconsciousness had been the absolute knowledge that he had never before worn a stillsuit. Yet, each motion of adjusting the adhesion tabs under Gurney's inexpert guidance had seemed natural, instinctive. When he had tightened the chest to gain maximum pumping action from the motion of breathing, he had known what he did and why. When he had fitted the neck and forehead tabs tightly, he had known it was to prevent friction blisters.
    Kynes straightened, stepped back with a puzzled expression. "You've worn a stillsuit before?" he asked. 
    "This is the first time." 
    "Then someone adjusted it for you?" 
    "No."
    "Your desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles. Who told you to do that?" 
    "It . . . seemed the right way." 
    "That it most certainly is."
    And Kynes rubbed his cheek, thinking of the legend: "He shall know your ways as though born to them."
    "We waste time," the Duke said. He gestured to the waiting 'thopter, led the way, accepting the guard's salute with a nod. He climbed in, fastened his safety harness, checked controls and instruments. The craft creaked as the others clambered aboard.
    Kynes fastened his harness, focused on the padded comfort of the aircraft--soft luxury of gray-green upholstery, gleaming instruments, the sensation of filtered and washed air in his lungs as doors slammed and vent fans whirred alive. 
    So soft! he thought.
    "All secure, Sire," Halleck said.
    Leto fed power to the wings, felt them cup and dip--once, twice. They were airborne in ten meters, wings feathered tightly and afterjets thrusting them upward in a steep, hissing climb.
    "Southeast over the Shield Wall," Kynes said. "That's where I told your sandmaster to concentrate his equipment." 
    "Right."
    The Duke banked into his air cover, the other craft taking up their guard positions as they headed southeast.
    "The design and manufacture of these stillsuits bespeaks a high degree of sophistication," the Duke said.
    "Someday I may show you a sietch factory," Kynes said.
    "I would find that interesting," the Duke said. "I note that suits are manufactured also in some of the garrison cities." 
    "Inferior copies," Kynes said. "Any Dune man who values his skin wears a Fremen suit." 
    "And it'll hold your water loss to a thimbleful a day?" 
    "Properly suited, your forehead cap tight, all seals in order, your major water loss is through the palms of your hands," Kynes said. "You can wear suit gloves if you're not using your hands for critical work, but most Fremen in the open desert rub their hands with juice from the leaves of the creosote bush. It inhibits perspiration." 
    The Duke glanced down to the left at the broken landscape of the Shield Wall--chasms of tortured rock, patches of yellow-brown crossed by black lines of fault shattering. It was as though someone had dropped this ground from space and left it where it smashed.
    They crossed a shallow basin with the clear outline of gray sand spreading across it from a canyon opening to the south. The sand fingers ran out into the basin--a dry delta outlined against darker rock.
    Kynes sat back, thinking about the water-fat flesh he had felt beneath the stillsuits. They wore shield belts over their robes, slow pellet stunners at the waist, coin-sized emergency transmitters on cords around their necks. Both the Duke and his son carried knives in wrist sheathes and the sheathes appeared well worn. The people struck Kynes as a strange combination of softness and armed strength. There was a poise to them totally unlike the Harkonnens.
    "When you report to the Emperor on the change of government here, will you say we observed the rules?" Leto asked. He glanced at Kynes, back to their course.
    "The Harkonnens left; you came," Kynes said.
    "And is everything as it should be?" Leto asked.
    Momentary tension showed in the tightening of a muscle along Kynes' jaw. "As Planetologist and Judge of the Change, I am a direct subject of the Imperium . . . my Lord." 
    The Duke smiled grimly. "But we both know the realities." 
    "I remind you that His Majesty supports my work." 
    "Indeed? And what is your work?"
    In the brief silence, Paul thought: He's pushing this Kynes too hard. Paul glanced at Halleck, but the minstrel-warrior was staring out at the barren landscape.
    Kynes spoke stiffly: "You, of course, refer to my duties as planetologist." 
    "Of course."
    "It is mostly dry land biology and botany . . . some geological work--core drilling and testing. You never really exhaust the possibilities of an entire planet." 
    "Do you also investigate the spice?"
    Kynes turned, and Paul noted the hard line of the man's cheek. "A curious question, my Lord."
    "Bear in mind, Kynes, that this is now my fief. My methods differ from those of the Harkonnens. I don't care if you study the spice as long as I share what you discover." He glanced at the planetologist. "The Harkonnens discouraged investigation of the spice, didn't they?" 
    Kynes stared back without answering.
    "You may speak plainly," the Duke said, "without fear for your skin."
    "The Imperial Court is, indeed, a long way off," Kynes muttered. And he thought: What does this water-soft invader expect? Does he think me fool enough to enlist with him?
    The Duke chuckled, keeping his attention on their course. "I detect a sour note in your voice, sir. We've waded in here with our mob of tame killers, eh? And we expect you to realize immediately that we're different from the Harkonnens?"
    "I've seen the propaganda you've flooded into sietch and village," Kynes said. " 'Love the good Duke!' Your corps of--" 
    "Here now!" Halleck barked. He snapped his attention away from the window, leaned forward. 
    Paul put a hand on Halleck's arm.
    "Gurney!" the Duke said. He glanced back. "This man's been long under the Harkonnens." 
    Halleck sat back. "Ayah."
    "Your man Hawat's subtle," Kynes said, "but his object's plain enough." 
    "Will you open those bases to us, then?" the Duke asked. 
    Kynes spoke curtly: "They're His Majesty's property." 
    "They're not being used." 
    "They could be used." 
    "Does His Majesty concur?"
    Kynes darted a hard stare at the Duke. "Arrakis could be an Eden if its rulers would look up from grubbing for spice!" 
    He didn't answer my question, the Duke thought. And he said: "How is a planet to become an Eden without money?" 
    "What is money," Kynes asked, "if it won't buy the services you need?"
    Ah, now! the Duke thought. And he said: "We'll discuss this another time. Right now, I believe we're coming to the edge of the Shield Wall. Do I hold the same course?" 
    "The same course," Kynes muttered.
    Paul looked out his window. Beneath them, the broken ground began to drop away in tumbled creases toward a barren rock plain and a knife-edged shelf. Beyond the shelf, fingernail crescents of dunes marched toward the horizon with here and there in the distance a dull smudge, a darker blotch to tell of something not sand. Rock outcroppings, perhaps. In the heat-addled air, Paul couldn't be sure.
    "Are there any plants down there?" Paul asked.
    "Some," Kynes said. "This latitude's life-zone has mostly what we call minor water stealers--adapted to raiding each other for moisture, gobbling up the trace-dew. Some parts of the desert teem with life. But all of it has learned how to survive under these rigors. If you get caught down there, you imitate that life or you die."
    "You mean steal water from each other?" Paul asked. The idea outraged him, and his voice betrayed his emotion.
    "It's done," Kynes said, "but that wasn't precisely my meaning. You see, my climate demands a special attitude toward water. You are aware of water at all times. You waste nothing that contains moisture." 
    And the Duke thought: " . . . my climate!"
    "Come around two degrees more southerly, my Lord," Kynes said. "There's a blow coming up from the west." 
    The Duke nodded. He had seen the billowing of tan dust there. He banked the 'thopter around, noting the way the escort's wings reflected milky orange from the dust-refracted light as they turned to keep pace with him.
    "This should clear the storm's edge," Kynes said.
    "That sand must be dangerous if you fly into it," Paul said. "Will it really cut the strongest metals?"
    "At this altitude, it's not sand but dust," Kynes said. "The danger is lack of visibility, turbulence, clogged intakes." 
    "We'll see actual spice mining today?" Paul asked. 
    "Very likely," Kynes said.
    Paul sat back. He had used the questions and hyperawareness to do what his mother called "registering" the person. He had Kynes now--tune of voice, each detail of face and gesture. An unnatural folding of the left sleeve on the man's robe told of a knife in an arm sheath. The waist bulged strangely. It was said that desert men wore a belted sash into which they tucked small necessities. Perhaps the bulges came from such a sash--certainly not from a concealed shield belt. A copper pin engraved with the likeness of a hare clasped the neck of Kynes' robe. Another smaller pin with similar likeness hung at the corner of the hood which was thrown back over his shoulders.
    Halleck twisted in the seat beside Paul, reached back into the rear compartment and brought out his baliset. Kynes looked around as Halleck tuned the instrument, then returned his attention to their course.
    "What would you like to hear, young Master?" Halleck asked. 
    "You choose, Gurney," Paul said.
    Halleck bent his ear close to the sounding board, strummed a chord and sang softly:

"Our fathers ate manna in the desert, 
In the burning places where whirlwinds came. 
Lord, save us from that horrible land! 
Save us . . . oh-h-h-h, save us 
From the dry and thirsty land."

    Kynes glanced at the Duke, said: "You do travel with a light complement of guards, my Lord. Are all of them such men of many talents?"
    "Gurney?" The Duke chuckled. "Gurney's one of a kind. I like him with me for his eyes. His eyes miss very little." 
    The planetologist frowned.
    Without missing a beat in his tune, Halleck interposed:

"For I am like an owl of the desert, o!
 Aiyah! am like an owl of the des-ert!"

    The Duke reached down, brought up a microphone from the instrument panel, thumbed it to life, said: "Leader to Escort Gemma. Flying object at nine o'clock, Sector B. Do you identify it?"
    "It's merely a bird," Kynes said, and added: "You have sharp eyes."
    The panel speaker crackled, then: "Escort Gemma. Object examined under full amplification. It's a large bird." 
    Paul looked in the indicated direction, saw the distant speck: a dot of intermittent motion, and realized how keyed up his father must be. Every sense was at full alert.
    "I'd not realized there were birds that large this far into the desert," the Duke said.
    "That's likely an eagle," Kynes said. "Many creatures have adapted to this place."
    The ornithopter swept over a bare rock plain. Paul looked down from their two thousand meters' altitude, saw the wrinkled shadow of their craft and escort. The land beneath seemed flat, but shadow wrinkles said otherwise.
    "Has anyone ever walked out of the desert?" the Duke asked. 
    Halleck's music stopped. He leaned forward to catch the answer.
    "Not from the deep desert," Kynes said. "Men have walked out of the second zone several times. They've survived by crossing the rock areas where worms seldom go."
    The timbre of Kynes' voice held Paul's attention. He felt his sense come alert the way they were trained to do.
    "Ah-h, the worms," the Duke said. "I must see one sometime." 
    "You may see one today," Kynes said. "Wherever there is spice, there are worms." 
    "Always?" Halleck asked. 
    "Always."
    "Is there relationship between worm and spice?" the Duke asked.
    Kynes turned and Paul saw the pursed lips as the man spoke. "They defend spice sands. Each worm has a--territory. As to the spice . . . who knows? Worm specimens we've examined lead us to suspect complicated chemical interchanges within them. We find traces of hydrochloric acid in the ducts, more complicated acid forms elsewhere. I'll give you my monograph on the subject."
    "And a shield's no defense?" the Duke asked.
    "Shields!" Kynes sneered. "Activate a shield within the worm zone and you seal your fate. Worms ignore territory lines, come from far around to attack a shield. No man wearing a shield has ever survived such attack." 
    "How are worms taken, then?"
    "High voltage electrical shock applied separately to each ring segment is the only known way of killing and preserving an entire worm," Kynes said. "They can be stunned and shattered by explosives, but each ring segment has a life of its own. Barring atomics, I know of no explosive powerful enough to destroy a large worm entirely. They're incredibly tough."
    "Why hasn't an effort been made to wipe them out?" Paul asked.
    "Too expensive," Kynes said. "Too much area to cover." 
    Paul leaned back in his corner. His truthsense, awareness of tone shadings, told him that Kynes was lying and telling half-truths. And he thought: If there's a relationship between spice and worms, killing the worms would destroy the spice.
    "No one will have to walk out of the desert soon," the Duke said. "Trip these little transmitters at our necks and rescue is on its way. All our workers will be wearing them before long. We're setting up a special rescue service." 
    "Very commendable," Kynes said.
    "Your tone says you don't agree," the Duke said.
    "Agree? Of course I agree, but it won't be much use. Static electricity from sandstorms masks out many signals. Transmitters short out. They've been tried here before, you know. Arrakis is tough on equipment. And if a worm's hunting you there's not much time. Frequently, you have no more than fifteen or twenty minutes." 
    "What would you advise?" the Duke asked. 
    "You ask my advice?" 
    "As planetologist, yes." 
    "You'd follow my advice?" 
    "If I found it sensible." 
    "Very well, my Lord. Never travel alone." 
    The Duke turned his attention from the controls. "That's all?" 
    "That's all. Never travel alone."
    "What if you're separated by a storm and forced down?" Halleck asked. "Isn't there anything you could do?" 
    "Any thing covers much territory," Kynes said. 
    "What would you do?" Paul asked.
    Kynes turned a hard stare at the boy, brought his attention back to the Duke. "I'd remember to protect the integrity of my stillsuit. If I were outside the worm zone or in rock, I'd stay with the ship. If I were down in open sand, I'd get away from the ship as fast as I could. About a thousand meters would be far enough. Then I'd hide beneath my robe. A worm would get the ship, but it might miss me." 
    "Then what?" Halleck asked.
    Kynes shrugged. "Wait for the worm to leave." 
    "That's all?" Paul asked.
    "When the worm has gone, one may try to walk out," Kynes said. "You must walk softly, avoid drum sands, tidal dust basins--head for the nearest rock zone. There are many such zones. You might make it." 
    "Drum sand?" Halleck asked.
    "A condition of sand compaction," Kynes said. "The slightest step sets it drumming. Worms always come to that." 
    "And a tidal dust basin?" the Duke asked.
    "Certain depressions in the desert have filled with dust over the centuries. Some are so vast they have currents and tides. All will swallow the unwary who step into them."
    Halleck sat back, resumed strumming the baliset. Presently, he sang:

"Wild beasts of the desert do hunt there, 
Waiting for the innocents to pass.
Oh-h-h, tempt not the gods of the desert, 
Lest you seek a lonely epitaph.
The perils of the--"

    He broke off, leaned forward. "Dust cloud ahead, Sire." 
    "I see it, Gurney." 
    "That's what we seek," Kynes said.
    Paul stretched up in the seat to peer ahead, saw a rolling yellow cloud low on the desert surface some thirty kilometers ahead.
    "One of your factory crawlers," Kynes said. "It's on the surface and that means it's on spice. The cloud is vented sand being expelled after the spice has been centrifugally removed. There's no other cloud quite like it." 
    "Aircraft over it," the Duke said.
    "I see two . . . three . . . four spotters," Kynes said. "They're watching for wormsign."
    "Wormsign?" the Duke asked.
    "A sandwave moving toward the crawler. They'll have seismic probes on the surface, too. Worms sometimes travel too deep for the wave to show." Kynes swung his gaze around the sky. "Should be a carryall wing around, but I don't see it." 
    "The worm always comes, eh?" Halleck asked. 
    "Always."
    Paul leaned forward, touched Kynes' shoulder. "How big an area does each worm stake out?" 
    Kynes frowned. The child kept asking adult questions. 
    "That depends on the size of the worm." 
    "What's the variation?" the Duke asked.
    "Big ones may control three or four hundred square kilometers. Small ones--" He broke off as the Duke kicked on the jet brakes. The ship bucked as its tail pods whispered to silence. Stub wings elongated, cupped the air. The craft became a full 'thopter as the Duke banked it, holding the wings to a gentle beat, pointing with his left hand off to the east beyond the factory crawler. 
    "Is that wormsign?" 
    Kynes leaned across the Duke to peer into the distance.
    Paul and Halleck were crowded together, looking in the same direction, and Paul noted that their escort, caught by the sudden maneuver, had surged ahead, but now was curving back. The factory crawler lay ahead of them, still some three kilometers away.
    Where the Duke pointed, crescent dune tracks spread shadow ripples toward the horizon and, running through them as a level line stretching into the distance, came an elongated mount-in-motion--a cresting of sand. It reminded Paul of the way a big fish disturbed the water when swimming just under the surface.
    "Worm," Kynes said. "Big one." He leaned back, grabbed the microphone from the panel, punched out a new frequency selection. Glancing at the grid chart on rollers over their heads, he spoke into the microphone: "Calling crawler at Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Crawler at Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Acknowledge, please." He waited.
    The panel speaker emitted static crackles, then a voice: "Who calls Delta Ajax niner? Over." 
    "They seem pretty calm about it," Halleck said.
    Kynes spoke into the microphone: "Unlisted flight--north and east of you about three kilometers. Wormsign is on intercept course, your position, estimated contact twenty-five minutes." 
    Another voice rumbled from the speaker: "This is Spotter Control. Sighting confirmed. Stand by for contact fix." There was a pause, then: "Contact in twenty-six minutes minus. That was a sharp estimate. Who's on that unlisted flight? Over." 
    Halleck had his harness off and surged forward between Kynes and the Duke. "Is this the regular working frequency, Kynes?" 
    "Yes. Why?" 
    "Who'd be listening?" 
    "Just the work crews in this area. Cuts down interference." 
    Again, the speaker crackled, then: "This is Delta Ajax niner. Who gets bonus credit for that spot? Over." 
    Halleck glanced at the Duke.
    Kynes said: "There's a bonus based on spice load for whoever gives first worm warning. They want to know--" 
    "Tell them who had first sight of that worm," Halleck said. 
    The Duke nodded.
    Kynes hesitated, then lifted the microphone; "Spotter credit to the Duke Leto Atreides. The Duke Leto Atreides. Over." 
    The voice from the speaker was flat and partly distorted by a burst of static: "We read and thank you."
    "Now, tell them to divide the bonus among themselves," Halleck ordered. "Tell them it's the Duke's wish." 
    Kynes took a deep breath, then: "It's the Duke's wish that you divide the bonus among your crew. Do you read? Over." 
    "Acknowledged and thank you," the speaker said.
    The Duke said: "I forgot to mention that Gurney is also very talented in public relations." 
    Kynes turned a puzzled frown on Halleck.
    "This lets the men know their Duke is concerned for their safety," Halleck said. "Word will get around. It was on an area working frequency--not likely Harkonnen agents heard." He glanced out at their air cover. "And we're a pretty strong force. It was a good risk."
    The Duke banked their craft toward the sandcloud erupting from the factory crawler. "What happens now?"
    "There's a carryall wing somewhere close," Kynes said. "It'll come in and lift off the crawler." 
    "What if the carryall's wrecked?" Halleck asked.
    "Some equipment is lost," Kynes said. "Get in close over the crawler, my Lord; you'll find this interesting."
    The Duke scowled, busied himself with the controls as they came into turbulent air over the crawler.
    Paul looked down, saw sand still spewing out of the metal and plastic monster beneath them. It looked like a great tan and blue beetle with many wide tracks extending on arms around it. He saw a giant inverted funnel snout poked into dark sand in front of it.
    "Rich spice bed by the color," Kynes said. "They'll continue working until the last minute."
    The Duke fed more power to the wings, stiffened them for a steeper descent as he settled lower in a circling glide above the crawler. A glance left and right showed his cover holding altitude and circling overhead.
    Paul studied the yellow cloud belching from the crawler's pipe vents, looked out over the desert at the approaching worm track.
    "Shouldn't we be hearing them call in the carryall?" Halleck asked.
    "They usually have the wing on a different frequency," Kynes said.
    "Shouldn't they have two carryalls standing by for every crawler?" the Duke asked. "There should be twenty-six men on that machine down there, not to mention cost of equipment." 
    Kynes said: "You don't have enough ex--"
    He broke off as the speaker erupted with an angry voice: "Any of you see the wing? He isn't answering."
    A garble of noise crackled from the speaker, drowned in an abrupt override signal, then silence and the first voice: "Report by the numbers! Over."
    "This is Spotter Control. Last I saw, the wing was pretty high and circling off northwest. I don't see him now. Over." 
    "Spotter one: negative. Over." 
    "Spotter two: negative. Over." 
    "Spotter three: negative. Over." 
    Silence.
    The Duke looked down. His own craft's shadow was just passing over the crawler. "Only four spotters, is that right?" 
    "Correct," Kynes said.
    "There are five in our party," the Duke said. "Our ships are larger. We can crowd in three extra each. Their spotters ought to be able to lift off two each." 
    Paul did the mental arithmetic, said: "That's three short." 
    "Why don't they have two carryalls to each crawler?" barked the Duke.
    "You don't have enough extra equipment," Kynes said. 
    "All the more reason we should protect what we have!" 
    "Where could that carryall go?" Halleck asked.
    "Could've been forced down somewhere out of sight," Kynes said.
    The Duke grabbed the microphone, hesitated with thumb poised over its switch. "How could they lose sight of a carryall?" 
    "They keep their attention on the ground looking for wormsign," Kynes said.
    The Duke thumbed the switch, spoke into the microphone. "This is your Duke. We are coming down to take off Delta Ajax niner's crew. All spotters are ordered to comply. Spotters will land on the east side. We will take the west. Over." He reached down, punched out his own command frequency, repeated the order for his own air cover, handed the microphone back to Kynes.
    Kynes returned to the working frequency and a voice blasted from the speaker: " . . . almost a full load of spice! We have almost a full load! We can't leave that for a damned worm! Over." 
    "Damn the spice!" the Duke barked. He grabbed back the microphone, said: "We can always get more spice. There are seats in our ships for all but three of you. Draw straws or decide any way you like who's to go. But you're going, and that's an order!" He slammed the microphone back into Kynes' hands, muttered: "Sorry," as Kynes shook an injured finger. 
    "How much time?" Paul asked. 
    "Nine minutes," Kynes said.
    The Duke said: "This ship has more power than the others. If we took off under jet with three-quarter wings, we could crowd in an additional man." 
    "That sand's soft," Kynes said.
    "With four extra men aboard on a jet takeoff, we could snap the wings, Sire," Halleck said.
    "Not on this ship," the Duke said. He hauled back on the controls as the 'thopter glided in beside the crawler. The wings tipped up, braked the 'thopter to a skidding stop within twenty meters of the factory.
    The crawler was silent now, no sand spouting from its vents. Only a faint mechanical rumble issued from it, becoming more audible as the Duke opened his door.
    Immediately, their nostrils were assailed by the odor of cinnamon--heavy and pungent.
    With a loud flapping, the spotter aircraft glided down to the sand on the other side of the crawler. The Duke's own escort swooped in to land in line with him.
    Paul, looking out at the factory, saw how all the 'thopters were dwarfed by it--gnats beside a warrior beetle.
    "Gurney, you and Paul toss out that rear seat," the Duke said. He manually cranked the wings out to three-quarters, set their angle, checked the jet pod controls. "Why the devil aren't they coming out of that machine?"
    "They're hoping the carryall will show up," Kynes said. "They still have a few minutes." He glanced off to the east.
    All turned to look the same direction, seeing no sign of the worm, but there was a heavy, charged feeling of anxiety in the air.
    The Duke took the microphone, punched for his command frequency, said: "Two of you toss out your shield generators. By the numbers. You can carry one more man that way. We're not leaving any men for that monster." He keyed back to the working frequency, barked: "All right, you in Delta Ajax niner! Out! Now! This is a command from your Duke! On the double or I'll cut that crawler apart with a lasgun!"
    A hatch snapped open near the front of the factory, another at the rear, another at the top. Men came tumbling out, sliding and scrambling down to the sand. A tall man in a patched working robe was the last to emerge. He jumped down to a track and then to the sand.
    The Duke hung the microphone on the panel, swung out onto the wing step, shouted: "Two men each into your spotters." 
    The man in the patched robe began lolling off pairs of his crew, pushing them toward the craft waiting on the other side.
    "Four over here!" the Duke shouted. "Four into that ship back there!" He jabbed a finger at an escort 'thopter directly behind him. The guards were just wrestling the shield generator out of it. "And four into that ship over there!" He pointed to the other escort that had shed its shield generator. "Three each into the others! Run, you sand dogs!"
    The tall man finished counting off his crew, came slogging across the sand followed by three of his companions. 
    "I hear the worm, but I can't see it," Kynes said.
    The others heard it then--an abrasive slithering, distant and growing louder.
    "Damn sloppy way to operate," the Duke muttered.
    Aircraft began flapping off the sand around them. It reminded the Duke of a time in his home planet's jungles, a sudden emergence into a clearing, and carrion birds lifting away from the carcass of a wild ox.
    The spice workers slogged up to the side of the 'thopter, started climbing in behind the Duke. Halleck helped, dragging them into the rear.
    "In you go, boys!" he snapped. "On the double!"
    Paul, crowded into a corner by sweating men, smelled the perspiration of fear, saw that two of the men had poor neck adjustments on their stillsuits. He filed the information in his memory for future action. His father would have to order tighter stillsuit discipline. Men tended to become sloppy if you didn't watch such things.
    The last man came gasping into the rear, said. "The worm! It's almost on us! Blast off!"
    The Duke slid into his seat, frowning, said: "We still have almost three minutes on the original contact estimate. Is that right, Kynes?" He shut his door, checked it.
    "Almost exactly, my Lord," Kynes said, and he thought: A cool one, this duke.
    "All secure here, Sire," Halleck said.
    The Duke nodded, watched the last of his escort take off. He adjusted the igniter, glanced once more at wings and instruments, punched the jet sequence.
    The take-off pressed the Duke and Kynes deep into their seats, compressed the people in the rear. Kynes watched the way the Duke handled the controls--gently, surely. The 'thopter was fully airborne now, and the Duke studied his instruments, glanced left and right at his wings.
    "She's very heavy, Sire," Halleck said.
    "Well within the tolerances of this ship," the Duke said. "You didn't really think I'd risk this cargo, did you, Gurney?" 
    Halleck grinned, said: "Not a bit of it, Sire."
    The Duke banked his craft in a long easy curve--climbing over the crawler.
    Paul, crushed into a corner beside a window, stared down at the silent machine on the sand. The wormsign had broken off about four hundred meters from the crawler. And now, there appeared to be turbulence in the sand around the factory.
    "The worm is now beneath the crawler," Kynes said. "You are about to witness a thing few have seen."
    Flecks of dust shadowed the sand around the crawler now. The big machine began to tip down to the right. A gigantic sand whirlpool began forming there to the right of the crawler. It moved faster and faster. Sand and dust filled the air now for hundreds of meters around.
    Then they saw it!
    A wide hole emerged from the sand. Sunlight flashed from glistening white spokes within it. The hole's diameter was at least twice the length of the crawler, Paul estimated. He watched as the machine slid into that opening in a billow of dust and sand. The hole pulled back.
    "Gods, what a monster!" muttered a man beside Paul. 
    "Got all our floggin' spice!" growled another.
    "Someone is going to pay for this," the Duke said. "I promise you that."
    By the very flatness of his father's voice, Paul sensed the deep anger. He found that he shared it. This was criminal waste! 
    In the silence that followed, they heard Kynes.
    "Bless the Maker and His water," Kynes murmured. "Bless the coming and going of Him. May His passage cleanse the world. May He keep the world for His people." 
    "What's that you're saying?" the Duke asked. 
    But Kynes remained silent.
    Paul glanced at the men crowded around him. They were staring fearfully at the back of Kynes' head. One of them whispered: "Liet." 
    Kynes turned, scowling. The man sank back, abashed.
    Another of the rescued men began coughing--dry and rasping. Presently, he gasped: "Curse this hell hole!"
    The tall Dune man who had come last out of the crawler said; "Be you still, Coss. You but worsen your cough." He stirred among the men until he could look through them at the back of the Duke's head. "You be the Duke Leto, I warrant," he said. "It's to you we give thanks for our lives. We were ready to end it there until you came along." 
    "Quiet, man, and let the Duke fly his ship," Halleck muttered.
    Paul glanced at Halleck. He, too, had seen the tension wrinkles at the corner of his father's jaw. One walked softly when the Duke was in a rage.
    Leto began easing his 'thopter out of its great banking circle, stopped at a new sign of movement on the sand. The worm had withdrawn into the depths and now, near where the crawler had been, two figures could be seen moving north away from the sand depression. They appeared to glide over the surface with hardly a lifting of dust to mark their passage.
    "Who's that down there?" the Duke barked.
    "Two Johnnies who came along for the ride, Soor," said the tall Dune man.
    "Why wasn't something said about them?" 
    "It was the chance they took, Soor," the Dune man said. 
    "My Lord," said Kynes, "these men know it's of little use to do anything about men trapped on the desert in worm country." 
    "We'll send a ship from base for them!" the Duke snapped.
    "As you wish, my Lord," Kynes said. "But likely when the ship gets here there'll be no one to rescue." 
    "We'll send a ship, anyway," the Duke said.
    "They were right beside where the worm came up," Paul said. "How'd they escape?"
    "The sides of the hole cave in and make the distances deceptive," Kynes said.
    "You waste fuel here, Sire," Halleck ventured. 
    "Aye, Gurney."
    The Duke brought his craft around toward the Shield Wall. His escort came down from circling stations, took up positions above and on both sides.
    Paul thought about what the Dune man and Kynes had said. He sensed half-truths, outright lies. The men on the sand had glided across the surface so surely, moving in a way obviously calculated to keep from luring the worm back out of its depths.
    Fremen! Paul thought. Who else would be so sure on the sand? Who else might be left out of your worries as a matter of course--because they are in no danger? They know how to live here! They know how to outwit the worm!
    "What were Fremen doing on that crawler?" Paul asked. 
    Kynes whirled.
    The tall Dune man turned wide eyes on Paul--blue within blue within blue. "Who be this lad?" he asked.
    Halleck moved to place himself between the man and Paul, said: "This is Paul Atreides, the ducal heir."
    "Why says he there were Fremen on our rumbler?" the man asked.
    "They fit the description," Paul said.
    Kynes snorted. "You can't tell Fremen just by looking at them!" He looked at the Dune man. "You. Who were those men?" 
    "Friends of one of the others," the Dune man said. "Just friends from a village who wanted to see the spice sands." 
    Kynes turned away. "Fremen!"
    But he was remembering the words of the legend: "The Lisan al-Gaib shall see through all subterfuge."
    "They be dead now, most likely, young Soor," the Dune man said. "We should not speak unkindly on them."
    But Paul heard the falsehood in their voices, felt the menace that had brought Halleck instinctively into guarding position.
    Paul spoke dryly: "A terrible place for them to die."
    Without turning, Kynes said; "When God hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place. He causeth that creature's wants to direct him to that place." 
    Leto turned a hard stare at Kynes.
    And Kynes, returning the stare, found himself troubled by a fact he had observed here: This Duke was concerned more over the men that he was over the spice. He risked his own life and that of his son to save the men. He passed off the loss of a spice crawler with a gesture. The threat to men's lives had him in a rage. A leader such as that would command fanatic loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat.
    Against his own will and all previous judgments, Kynes admitted to himself: I like this Duke.

= = = = = =

Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.
-from "Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    In the dining hall of the Arrakeen great house, suspensor lamps had been lighted against the early dark. They cast their yellow glows upward onto the black bull's head with its bloody horns, and onto the darkly glistening oil painting of the Old Duke.
    Beneath these talismans, white linen shone around the burnished reflections of the Atreides silver, which had been placed in precise arrangements along the great table--little archipelagos of service waiting beside crystal glasses, each setting squared off before a heavy wooden chair. The classic central chandelier remained unlighted, and its chain twisted upward into shadows where the mechanism of the poison-snooper had been concealed.
    Pausing in the doorway to inspect the arrangements, the Duke thought about the poison-snooper and what it signified in his society.
    All of a pattern, he thought. You can plumb us by our language--the precise and delicate delineations for ways to administer treacherous death. Will someone try chaumurky tonight--poison in the drink? Or will it be chaumas--poison in the food?
    He shook his head.
    Beside each plate on the long table stood a flagon of water. There was enough water along the table, the Duke estimated, to keep a poor Arrakeen family for more than a year.
    Flanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of ornate yellow and green tile. Each basin had its rack of towels. It was the custom, the housekeeper had explained, for guests as they entered to dip their hands ceremoniously into a basin, slop several cups of water onto the floor, dry their hands on a towel and fling the towel into the growing puddle at the door. After the dinner, beggars gathered outside to get the water squeezings from the towels.
    How typical of a Harkonnen fief, the Duke thought. Every degradation of the spirit that can be conceived. He took a deep breath, feeling rage tighten his stomach. 
    "The custom stops here!" he muttered.
    He saw a serving woman--one of the old and gnarled ones the housekeeper had recommended--hovering at the doorway from the kitchen across from him. The Duke signaled with upraised hand. She moved out of the shadows, scurried around the table toward him, and he noted the leathery face, the blue-within-blue eyes. 
    "My Lord wishes?" She kept her head bowed, eyes shielded. 
    He gestured. "Have these basins and towels removed." 
    "But . . . Noble Born . . ." She looked up, mouth gaping.
    "I know the custom!" he barked. "Take these basins to the front door. While we're eating and until we've finished, each beggar who calls may have a full cup of water. Understood?" 
    Her leathery face displayed a twisting of emotions: dismay, anger . . .
    With sudden insight, Leto realized that she must have planned to sell the water squeezings from the foot-trampled towels, wringing a few coppers from the wretches who came to the door. Perhaps that also was a custom.
    His face clouded, and he growled: "I'm posting a guard to see that my orders are carried out to the letter."
    He whirled, strode back down the passage to the Great Hall. Memories rolled in his mind like the toothless mutterings of old women. He remembered open water and waves--days of grass instead of sand--dazed summers that had whipped past him like windstorm leaves. 
    All gone.
    I'm getting old, he thought. I've felt the cold hand of my mortality. And in what? An old woman's greed.
    In the Great Hall, the Lady Jessica was the center of a mixed group standing in front of the fireplace. An open blaze crackled there, casting flickers of orange light onto jewels and laces and costly fabrics. He recognized in the group a stillsuit manufacturer down from Carthag, an electronics equipment importer, a water-shipper whose summer mansion was near his polar-cap factory, a representative of the Guild Bank (lean and remote, that one), a dealer in replacement parts for spice mining equipment, a thin and hard-faced woman whose escort service for off-planet visitors reputedly operated as cover for various smuggling, spying, and blackmail operations.
    Most of the women in the hall seemed cast from a specific type--decorative, precisely turned out, an odd mingling of untouchable sensuousness.
    Even without her position as hostess, Jessica would have dominated the group, he thought. She wore no jewelry and had chosen warm colors--a long dress almost the shade of the open blaze, and an earth-brown band around her bronzed hair.
    He realized she had done this to taunt him subtly, a reproof against his recent pose of coldness. She was well aware that he liked her best in these shades--that he saw her as a rustling of warm colors.
    Nearby, more an outflanker than a member of the group, stood Duncan Idaho in glittering dress uniform, flat face unreadable, the curling black hair neatly combed. He had been summoned back from the Fremen and had his orders from Hawat--"Under pretext of guarding her, you will keep the Lady Jessica under constant surveillance." 
    The Duke glanced around the room.
    There was Paul in the corner surrounded by a fawning group of the younger Arrakeen richece, and, aloof among them, three officers of the House Troop. The Duke took particular note of the young women. What a catch a ducal heir would make. But Paul was treating all equally with an air of reserved nobility.
    He'll wear the title well, the Duke thought, and realized with a sudden chill that this was another death thought.
    Paul saw his father in the doorway, avoided his eyes. He looked around at the clusterings of guests, the jeweled hands clutching drinks (and the unobtrusive inspections with tiny remote-cast snoopers). Seeing all the chattering faces, Paul was suddenly repelled by them. They were cheap masks locked on festering thoughts--voices gabbling to drown out the loud silence in every breast.
    I'm in a sour mood, he thought, and wondered what Gurney would say to that.
    He knew his mood's source. He hadn't wanted to attend this function, but his father had been firm. "You have a place--a position to uphold. You're old enough to do this. You're almost a man."
    Paul saw his father emerge from the doorway, inspect the room, then cross to the group around the Lady Jessica.
    As Leto approached Jessica's group, the water-shipper was asking: "Is it true the Duke will put in weather control?" 
    From behind the man, the Duke said: "We haven't gone that far in our thinking, sir."
    The man turned, exposing a bland round face, darkly tanned. "Ah-h, the Duke," he said. "We missed you."
    Leto glanced at Jessica. "A thing needed doing." He returned his attention to the water-shipper, explained what he had ordered for the laving basins, adding: "As far as I'm concerned, the old custom ends now." 
    "Is this a ducal order, m'Lord?" the man asked.
    "I leave that to your own . . . ah . . . conscience," the Duke said. He turned, noting Kynes come up to the group.
    One of the women said: "I think it's a very generous gesture--giving water to the--" Someone shushed her.
    The Duke looked at Kynes, noting that the planetologist wore an old-style dark brown uniform with epaulets of the Imperial Civil Servant and a tiny gold teardrop of rank at his collar.
    The water-shipper asked in an angry voice: "Does the Duke imply criticism of our custom?"
    "This custom has been changed," Leto said. He nodded to Kynes, marked the frown on Jessica's face, thought: A frown does not become her, but it'll increase rumors of friction between us.
    "With the Duke's permission," the water-shipper said, "I'd like to inquire further about customs."
    Leto heard the sudden oily tone in the man's voice, noted the watchful silence in this group, the way heads were beginning to turn toward them around the room.
    "Isn't it almost time for dinner?" Jessica asked.
    "But our guest has some questions," Leto said. And he looked at the water-shipper, seeing a round-faced man with large eyes and thick lips, recalling Hawat's memorandum: ". . . and this water-shipper is a man to watch--Lingar Bewt, remember the name. The Harkonnens used him but never fully controlled him." 
    "Water customs are so interesting," Bewt said, and there was a smile on his face. "I'm curious what you intend about the conservatory attached to this house. Do you intend to continue flaunting it in the people's faces . . . m'Lord?"
    Leto held anger in check, staring at the man. Thoughts raced through his mind. It had taken bravery to challenge him in his own ducal castle, especially since they now had Bewt's signature over a contract of allegiance. The action had taken, also, a knowledge of personal power. Water was, indeed, power here. If water facilities were mined, for instance, ready to be destroyed at a signal . . . The man looked capable of such a thing. Destruction of water facilities might well destroy Arrakis. That could well have been the club this Bewt held over the Harkonnens.
    "My Lord, the Duke, and I have other plans for our conservatory," Jessica said. She smiled at Leto. "We intend to keep it, certainly, but only to hold it in trust for the people of Arrakis. It is our dream that someday the climate of Arrakis may be changed sufficiently to grow such plants anywhere in the open." 
    Bless her! Leto thought. Let our water-shipper chew on that.
    "Your interest in water and weather control is obvious," the Duke said. "I'd advise you to diversify your holdings. One day, water will not be a precious commodity on Arrakis." 
    And he thought: Hawat must redouble his efforts at infiltrating this Bewt's organization. And we must start on stand-by water facilities at once. No man is going to hold a club over my head!
    Bewt nodded, the smile still on his face. "A commendable dream, my Lord." He withdrew a pace.
    Leto's attention was caught by the expression on Kynes' face. The man was staring at Jessica. He appeared transfigured--like a man in love . . . or caught in a religious trance.
    Kynes' thoughts were overwhelmed at last by the words of prophecy: "And they shall share your most precious dream. "He spoke directly to Jessica: "Do you bring the shortening of the way?"
    "Ah, Dr. Kynes," the water-shipper said. "You've come in from tramping around with your mobs of Fremen. How gracious of you."
    Kynes passed an unreadable glance across Bewt, said: "It is said in the desert that possession of water in great amount can inflict a man with fatal carelessness."
    "They have many strange sayings in the desert," Bewt said, but his voice betrayed uneasiness.
    Jessica crossed to Leto, slipped her hand under his arm to gain a moment in which to calm herself. Kynes had said: " . . . the shortening of the way." In the old tongue, the phrase translated as "Kwisatz Haderach." The planetologist's odd question seemed to have gone unnoticed by the others, and now Kynes was bending over one of the consort women, listening to a low-voiced coquetry.
    Kwisatz Haderach, Jessica thought. Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that legend here, too? The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul. He could be the Kwisatz Haderach. He could be.
    The Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the water-shipper, and Bewt's voice lifted above the renewed hum of conversations: "Many people have sought to change Arrakis." 
    The Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the planetologist upright and away from the flirting woman.
    Into the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared his throat behind Leto, said: "Dinner is served, my Lord." 
    The Duke directed a questioning glance down at Jessica.
    "The custom here is for host and hostess to follow their guests to table," She said, and smiled; "Shall we change that one, too, my Lord?"
    He spoke coldly: "That seems a goodly custom. We shall let it stand for now."
    The illusion that I suspect her of treachery must be maintained, he thought. He glanced at the guests filing past them. Who among you believes this lie?
    Jessica, sensing his remoteness, wondered at it as she had done frequently the past week. He acts like a man struggling with himself, she thought. Is it because I moved so swiftly setting up this dinner party? Yet, he knows how important it is that we begin to mix our officers and men with the locals on a social plane. We are father and mother surrogate to them all. Nothing impresses that fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing.
    Leto, watching the guests file past, recalled what Thufir Hawat had said when informed of the affair: "Sire! I forbid it!" 
    A grim smile touched the Duke's mouth. What a scene that had been. And when the Duke had remained adamant about attending the dinner. Hawat had shaken his head. "I have bad feelings about this, my Lord," he'd said. "Things move too swiftly on Arrakis. That's not like the Harkonnens. Not like them at all." 
    Paul passed his father escorting a young woman half a head taller than himself. He shot a sour glance at his father, nodded at something the young woman said.
    "Her father manufactures stillsuits," Jessica said. "I'm told that only a fool would be caught in the deep desert wearing one of the man's suits."
    "Who's the man with the scarred face ahead of Paul?" the Duke asked. "I don't place him."
    "A late addition to the list," she whispered. "Gurney arranged the invitation. Smuggler." 
    "Gurney arranged?"
    "At my request. It was cleared with Hawat, although I thought Hawat was a little stiff about it. The smuggler's called Tuek, Esmar Tuek. He's a power among his kind. They all know him here. He's dined at many of the houses." 
    "Why is he here?"
    "Everyone here will ask that question," she said. "Tuek will sow doubt and suspicion just by his presence. He'll also serve notice that you're prepared to back up your orders against graft--by enforcement from the smugglers' end as well. This was the point Hawat appeared to like."
    "I'm not sure I like it." He nodded to a passing couple, saw only a few of their guests remained to precede them. "Why didn't you invite some Fremen?" 
    "There's Kynes," she said.
    "Yes, there's Kynes," he said. "Have you arranged any other little surprises for me?" He led her into step behind the procession. 
    "All else is most conventional," she said.
    And she thought: My darling, can't you see that this smuggler controls fast ships, that he can be bribed? We must have a way out, a door of escape from Arrakis if all else fails us here.
    As they emerged into the dining hall, she disengaged her arm, allowed Leto to seat her. He strode to his end of the table. A footman held his chair for him. The others settled with a swishing of fabrics, a scraping of chairs, but the Duke remained standing. He gave a hand signal, and the house troopers in footman uniform around the table stepped back, standing at attention. 
    Uneasy silence settled over the room.
    Jessica, looking down the length of the table, saw a faint trembling at the corners of Leto's mouth, noted the dark flush of anger on his cheeks. What has angered him? she asked herself. Surely not my invitation to the smuggler.
    "Some question my changing of the laving basin custom," Leto said. "This is my way of telling you that many things will change." 
    Embarrassed silence settled over the table. 
    They think him drunk, Jessica thought.
    Leto lifted his water flagon, held it aloft where the suspensor, lights shot beams of reflection off it. "As a Chevalier of the Imperium, then," he said, "I give you a toast."
    The others grasped their flagons, all eyes focused on the Duke. In the sudden stillness, a suspensor light drifted slightly in an errant breeze from the serving kitchen hallway. Shadows played across the Duke's hawk features.
    "Here I am and here I remain!" he barked.
    There was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths--stopped as the Duke remained with arm upraised. "My toast is one of those maxims so dear to our hearts: 'Business makes progress! Fortune passes everywhere!' " 
    He sipped his water.
    The others joined him. Questioning glances passed among them. 
    "Gurney!" the Duke called.
    From an alcove at Leto's end of the room came Halleck's voice. "Here, my Lord." 
    "Give us a tune, Gurney."
    A minor chord from the baliset floated out of the alcove. Servants began putting plates of food on the table at the Duke's gesture releasing them--roast desert hare in sauce cepeda, aplomage sirian, chukka under glass, coffee with melange (a rich cinnamon odor from the spice wafted across the table), a true pot-a-oie served with sparkling Caladan wine.
    Still, the Duke remained standing.
    As the guests waited, their attention torn between the dishes placed before them and the standing Duke, Leto said: "In olden times, it was the duty of the host to entertain his guests with his own talents." His knuckles turned white, so fiercely did he grip his water flagon. "I cannot sing, but I give you the words of Gurney's song. Consider it another toast--a toast to all who've died bringing us to this station." 
    An uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table.
    Jessica lowered her gaze, glanced at the people seated nearest her--there was the round-faced water-shipper and his woman, the pale and austere Guild Bank representative (he seemed a whistle-faced scarecrow with his eyes fixed on Leto), the rugged and scar-faced Tuck, his blue-within-blue eyes downcast.
    "Review, friends--troops long past review," the Duke intoned. "All to fate a weight of pains and dollars. Their spirits wear our silver collars. Review, friends--troops long past review: Each a dot of time without pretense or guile. With them passes the lure of fortune. Review, friends--troops long past review. When our time ends on its rictus smile, we'll pass the lure of fortune." 
    The Duke allowed his voice to trail off on the last line, took a deep drink from his water flagon, slammed it back onto the table. Water slopped over the brim onto the linen. 
    The others drank in embarrassed silence.
    Again, the Duke lifted his water flagon, and this time emptied its remaining half onto the floor, knowing that the others around the table must do the same.
    Jessica was first to follow his example.
    There was a frozen moment before the others began emptying their flagons. Jessica saw how Paul, seated near his father, was studying the reactions around him. She found herself also fascinated by what her guests' actions revealed--especially among the women. This was clean, potable water, not something already cast away in a sopping towel. Reluctance to just discard it exposed itself in trembling hands, delayed reactions' nervous laughter . . . and violent obedience to the necessity. One woman dropped her flagon, looked the other way as her male companion recovered it.
    Kynes, though, caught her attention most sharply. The planetotogist hesitated, then emptied his flagon into a container beneath his jacket. He smiled at Jessica as he caught her watching him, raised the empty flagon to her in a silent toast. He appeared completely unembarrassed by his action.
    Halleck's music still wafted over the room, but it had come out of its minor key, lilting and lively now as though he were trying to lift the mood.
    "Let the dinner commence," the Duke said, and sank into his chair.
    He's angry and uncertain, Jessica thought. The loss of that factory crawler hit him more deeply than it should have. It must be something more than that loss. He acts like a desperate man. She lifted her fork, hoping in the motion to hide her own sudden bitterness. Why not? He is desperate.
    Slowly at first, then with increasing animation, the dinner got under way. The stillsuit manufacturer complimented Jessica on her chef and wine.
    "We brought both from Caladan," she said.
    "Superb!" he said, tasting the chukka. "Simply superb! And not a hint of melange in it. One gets so tired of the spice in everything." 
    The Guild Bank representative looked across at Kynes. "I understand, Doctor Kynes, that another factory crawler has been lost to a worm." 
    "News' travels fast," the Duke said.
    "Then it's true?" the banker asked, shifting his attention to Leto.
    "Of course, it's true!" the Duke snapped. "The blasted carry-all disappeared. It shouldn't be possible for anything that big to disappear!"
    "When the worm came, there was nothing to recover the crawler," Kynes said.
    "It should not be possible!" the Duke repeated. 
    "No one saw the carryall leave?" the banker asked.
    "Spotters customarily keep their eyes on the sand," Kynes said. "They're primarily interested in wormsign. A carryall's complement usually is four men--two pilots and two journeymen attachers. If one--or even two of this crew were in the pay of the Duke's foes--"
    "Ah-h-h, I see," the banker said. "And you, as Judge of the Change, do you challenge this?"
    "I shall have to consider my position carefully," Kynes said, "and I certainly will not discuss it at table." And he thought: That pale skeleton of a man! He knows this is the kind of infraction I was instructed to ignore.
    The banker smiled, returned his attention to his food.
    Jessica sat remembering a lecture from her Bene Gesserit school days. The subject had been espionage and counter-espionage. A plump, happy-faced Reverend Mother had been the lecturer, her jolly voice contrasting weirdly with the subject matter.
    A thing to note about any espionage and/or counter-espionage school is the similar basic reaction pattern of all its graduates. Any enclosed discipline sets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students. That pattern is susceptible to analysis and prediction.
    "Now, motivational patterns are going to be similar among all espionage agents. That is to say: there will be certain types of motivation that are similar despite differing schools or opposed aims. You will study first how to separate this element for your analysis--in the beginning, through interrogation patterns that betray the inner orientation of the interrogators; secondly, by close observation of language-thought orientation of those under analysis. You will find it fairly simple to determine the root languages of your subjects, of course, both through voice inflection and speech pattern."
    Now, sitting at table with her son and her Duke and their guests, hearing that Guild Bank representative, Jessica felt a chill of realization: the man was a Harkonnen agent. He had the Giedi Prime speech pattern--subtly masked, but exposed to her trained awareness as though he had announced himself.
    Does this mean the Guild itself has taken sides against House Atreides? she asked herself. The thought shocked her, and she masked her emotion by calling for a new dish, all the while listening for the man to betray his purpose. He will shift the conversation next to something seemingly innocent, but with ominous overtones, she told herself. It's his pattern.
    The banker swallowed, took a sip of wine, smiled at something said to him by the woman on his right. He seemed to listen for a moment to a man down the table who was explaining to the Duke that native Arrakeen plants had no thorns.
    "I enjoy watching the flights of birds on Arrakis," the banker said, directing his words at Jessica. "All of our birds, of course, are carrion-eaters, and many exist without water, having become blood-drinkers."
    The stillsuit manufacturer's daughter, seated between Paul and his father at the other end of the table, twisted her pretty face into a frown, said: "Oh, Soo-Soo, you say the most disgusting things." 
    The banker smiled. "They call me Soo-Soo because I'm financial adviser to the Water Peddlers Union." And, as Jessica continued to look at him without comment, he added: "Because of the water-sellers' cry--'Soo-Soo Sook!' " And he imitated the call with such accuracy that many around the table laughed.
    Jessica heard the boastful tone of voice, but noted most that the young woman had spoken on cue--a set piece. She had produced the excuse for the banker to say what he had said. She glanced at Lingar Bewt. The water magnate was scowling, concentrating on his dinner. It came to Jessica that the banker had said: "I, too, control that ultimate source of power on Arrakis--water." 
    Paul had marked the falseness in his dinner companion's voice, saw that his mother was following the conversation with Bene Gesserit intensity. On impulse, he decided to play the foil, draw the exchange out. He addressed himself to the banker. 
    "Do you mean, sir, that these birds are cannibals?" 
    "That's an odd question, young Master," the banker said. "I merely said the birds drink blood. It doesn't have to be the blood of their own kind, does it?"
    "It was not an odd question," Paul said, and Jessica noted the brittle riposte quality of her training exposed in his voice. "Most educated people know that the worst potential competition for any young organism can come from its own kind." He deliberately forked a bite of food from his companion's plate, ate it. "They are eating from the same bowl. They have the same basic requirements." 
    The banker stiffened, scowled at the Duke.
    "Do not make the error of considering my son a child," the Duke said. And he smiled.
    Jessica glanced around the table, noted that Bewt had brightened, that both Kynes and the smuggler, Tuek, were grinning.
    "It's a rule of ecology," Kynes said, "that the young Master appears to understand quite well. The struggle between life elements is the struggle for the free energy of a system. Blood's an efficient energy source."
    The banker put down his fork, spoke in an angry voice: "It's said that the Fremen scum drink the blood of their dead." 
    Kynes shook his head, spoke in a lecturing tone: "Not the blood, sir. But all of a man's water, ultimately, belongs to his people--to his tribe. It's a necessity when you live near the Great Flat. All water's precious there, and the human body is composed of some seventy per cent water by weight. A dead man, surely, no longer requires that water."
    The banker put both hands against the table beside his plate, and Jessica thought he was going to push himself back, leave in a rage.
    Kynes looked at Jessica. "Forgive me, my Lady, for elaborating on such an ugly subject at table, but you were being told falsehood and it needed clarifying."
    "You've associated so long with Fremen that you've lost all sensibilities," the banker rasped.
    Kynes looked at him calmly, studied the pale, trembling face. "Are you challenging me, sir?"
    The banker froze. He swallowed, spoke stiffly: "Of course not. I'd not so insult our host and hostess."
    Jessica heard the fear in the man's voice, saw it in his face, in his breathing, in the pulse of a vein at his temple. The man was terrified of Kynes!
    "Our host and hostess are quite capable of deciding for themselves when they've been insulted," Kynes said. "They're brave people who understand defense of honor. We all may attest to their courage by the fact that they are here . . . now . . . on Arrakis."
    Jessica saw that Leto was enjoying this. Most of the others were not. People all around the table sat poised for flight, hands out of sight under the table. Two notable exceptions were Bewt, who was openly smiling at the banker's discomfiture, and the smuggler, Tuek, who appeared to be watching Kynes for a cue. Jessica saw that Paul was looking at Kynes in admiration. 
    "Well?" Kynes said.
    "I meant no offense," the banker muttered. "If offense was taken, please accept my apologies."
    "Freely given, freely accepted," Kynes said. He smiled at Jessica, resumed eating as though nothing had happened.
    Jessica saw that the smuggler, too, had relaxed. She marked this: the man had shown every aspect of an aide ready to leap to Kynes' assistance. There existed an accord of some sort between Kynes and Tuek.
    Leto toyed with a fork, looked speculatively at Kynes. The Geologist's manner indicated a change in attitude toward the House of Atreides. Kynes had seemed colder on their trip over the desert.
    Jessica signaled for another course of food and drink. Servants appeared with langues de lapins de garenne--red wine and a sauce of mushroom-yeast on the side.
    Slowly, the dinner conversation resumed, but Jessica heard the agitation in it, the brittle quality, saw that the banker ate in sullen silence. Kynes would have killed him without hesitating, she thought. And she realized that there was an offhand attitude toward killing in Kynes' manner. He was a casual killer, and she guessed that this was a Fremen quality.
    Jessica turned to the stillsuit manufacturer on her left, said: "I find myself continually amazed by the importance of water on Arrakis."
    "Very important," he agreed. "What is this dish? It's delicious."
    "Tongues of wild rabbit in a special sauce," she said. "A very old recipe." 
    "I must have that recipe," the man said. 
    She nodded. "I'll see that you get it."
    Kynes looked at Jessica, said: "The newcomer to Arrakis frequently underestimates the importance of water here. You are dealing, you see, with the Law of the Minimum." 
    She heard the testing quality in his voice, said, "Growth is limited by that necessity which is present in the least amount. And, naturally, the least favorable condition controls the growth rate." 
    "It's rare to find members of a Great House aware of planetological problems," Kynes said. "Water is the least favorable condition for life on Arrakis. And remember that growth itself can produce unfavorable conditions unless treated with extreme care."
    Jessica sensed a hidden message in Kynes' words, but knew she was missing it. "Growth," she said. "Do you mean Arrakis can have an orderly cycle of water to sustain human life under more favorable conditions?" 
    "Impossible!" the water magnate barked. 
    Jessica turned her attention to Bewt. "Impossible?" 
    "Impossible on Arrakis," he said. "Don't listen to this dreamer. All the laboratory evidence is against him."
    Kynes looked at Bewt, and Jessica noted that the other conversations around the table had stopped while people concentrated on this new interchange.
    "Laboratory evidence tends to blind us to a very simple fact," Kynes said. "That fact is this: we are dealing here with matters that originated and exist out-of-doors where plants and animals carry on their normal existence." 
    "Normal!" Bewt snorted. "Nothing about Arrakis is normal!" 
    "Quite the contrary," Kynes said. "Certain harmonies could be set up here along self-sustaining lines. You merely have to understand the limits of the planet and the pressures upon it." 
    "It'll never be done," Bewt said.
    The Duke came to a sudden realization, placing the point where Kynes' attitude had changed--it had been when Jessica had spoken of holding the conservatory plants in trust for Arrakis.
    "What would it take to set up the self-sustaining system, Doctor Kynes?" Leto asked.
    "If we can get three per cent of the green plant element on Arrakis involved in forming carbon compounds as foodstuffs, we've started the cyclic system," Kynes said.
    "Water's the only problem?" the Duke asked. He sensed Kynes' excitement, felt himself caught up in it.
    "Water overshadows the other problems," Kynes said. "This planet has much oxygen without its usual concomitants--widespread plant life and large sources of free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as volcanoes. There are unusual chemical interchanges over large surf ace areas here." 
    "Do you have pilot projects?" the Duke asked.
    "We've had a long time in which to build up the Tansley Effect--small-unit experiments on an amateur basis from which my science may now draw its working facts." Kynes said.
    "There isn't enough water," Bewt said. "There just isn't enough water."
    "Master Bewt is an expert on water," Kynes said. He smiled, turned back to his dinner.
    The Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: "No! I want an answer! Is there enough water, Doctor Kynes?" 
    Kynes stared at his plate.
    Jessica watched the play of emotion on his face. He masks himself well, she thought, but she had him registered now and read that he regretted his words.
    "Is there enough water?" the Duke demanded. 
    "There . . . maybe," Kynes said. 
    He's faking uncertainty! Jessica thought.
    With his deeper truthsense, Paul caught the underlying motive, had to use every ounce of his training to mask his excitement. There is enough water! But Kynes doesn't wish it to be known.
    "Our planetologist has many interesting dreams," Bewt said. "He dreams with the Fremen--of prophecies and messiahs." 
    Chuckles sounded at odd places around the table Jessica marked them--the smuggler, the stillsuit manufacturer's daughter, Duncan Idaho, the woman with the mysterious escort service.
    Tensions are oddly distributed here tonight, Jessica thought. There's too much going on of which I'm not aware. I'll have to develop new information sources.
    The Duke passed his gaze from Kynes to Bewt to Jessica. He felt oddly let down, as though something vital had passed him here. "May be," he muttered.
    Kynes spoke quickly: "Perhaps we should discuss this another time, my Lord. There are so many--"
    The planetologist broke off as an uniformed Atreides trooper hurried in through the service door, was passed by the guard and rushed to the Duke's side. The man bent, whispering into Leto's ear.
    Jessica recognized the capsign of Hawat's corps, fought down uneasiness. She addressed herself to the stillsuit manufacturer's feminine companion--a tiny, dark-haired woman with a doll face, a touch of epicanthic fold to the eyes.
    "You've hardly touched your dinner, my dear," Jessica said. "May I order you something?"
    The woman looked at the stillsuit manufacturer before answering, then: "I'm not very hungry."
    Abruptly, the Duke stood up beside his trooper, spoke in a harsh tone of command: "Stay seated, everyone. You will have to forgive me, but a matter has arisen that requires my personal attention." He stepped aside. "Paul, take over as host for me, if you please." 
    Paul stood, wanting to ask why his father had to leave, knowing he had to play this with the grand manner. He moved around to his father's chair, sat down in it.
    The Duke turned to the alcove where Halleck sat, said: "Gurney, please take Paul's place at table. We mustn't have an odd number here. When the dinner's over, I may want you to bring Paul to the field C.P. Wait for my call."
    Halleck emerged from the alcove in dress uniform, his lumpy ugliness seeming out of place in the glittering finery. He leaned his baliset against the wall, crossed to the chair Paul had occupied, sat down.
    "There's no need for alarm," the Duke said, "but I must ask that no one leave until our house guard says it's safe. You will be perfectly secure as long as you remain here, and we'll have this little trouble cleared up very shortly."
    Paul caught the code words in his father's message--guard-safe-secure-shortly. The problem was security, not violence. He saw that his mother had read the same message. They both relaxed.
    The Duke gave a short nod, wheeled and strode through the service door followed by his trooper.
    Paul said: "Please go on with your dinner. I believe Doctor Kynes was discussing water." 
    "May we discuss it another time?" Kynes asked. 
    "By all means," Paul said.
    And Jessica noted with pride her son's dignity, the mature sense of assurance.
    The banker picked up his water flagon, gestured with it at Bewt. "None of us here can surpass Master Lingar Bewt in flowery phrases. One might almost assume he aspired to Great House status. Come, Master Bewt, lead us in a toast. Perhaps you've a dollop of wisdom for the boy who must be treated like a man." 
    Jessica clenched her right hand into a fist beneath the table. She saw a handsignal pass from Halleck to Idaho, saw the house troopers along the walls move into positions of maximum guard. 
    Bewt cast a venomous glare at the banker.
    Paul glanced at Halleck, took in the defensive positions of his guards, looked at the banker until the man lowered the water flagon. He said: "Once, on Caladan, I saw the body of a drowned fisherman recovered. He--"
    "Drowned?" It was the stillsuit manufacturer's daughter.
    Paul hesitated, then: "Yes. Immersed in water until dead. Drowned." 
    "What an interesting way to die," she murmured.
    Paul's smile became brittle. He returned his attention to the banker. "The interesting thing about this man was the wounds on his shoulders--made by another fisherman's claw-boots. This fisherman was one of several in a boat--a craft for traveling on water--that foundered . . . sank beneath the water. Another fisherman helping recover the body said he'd seen marks like this man's wounds several times. They meant another drowning fisherman had tried to stand on this poor fellow's shoulders in the attempt to reach up to the surface--to reach air." 
    "Why is this interesting?" the banker asked.
    "Because of an observation made by my father at the time. He said the drowning man who climbs on your shoulders to save himself is understandable--except when you see it happen in the drawing room." Paul hesitated just long enough for the banker to see the point coming, then: "And, I should add, except when you see it at the dinner table." 
    A sudden stillness enfolded the room.
    That was rash, Jessica thought. This banker might have enough rank to call my son out. She saw that Idaho was poised for instant action. The House troopers were alert. Gurney Halleck had his eyes on the men opposite him.
    "Ho-ho-ho-o-o-o!" It was the smuggler, Tuek, head thrown back laughing with complete abandon. 
    Nervous smiles appeared around the table. 
    Bewt was grinning.
    The banker had pushed his chair back, was glaring at Paul. 
    Kynes said: "One baits an Atreides at his own risk." 
    "Is it Atreides custom to insult their guests?" the banker demanded.
    Before Paul could answer, Jessica leaned forward, said: "Sir!" And she thought: We must learn this Harkonnen creature's game. Is he here to try for Paul? Does he have help?
    "My son displays a general garment and you claim it's cut to your fit?" Jessica asked. "What a fascinating revelation." She slid a hand down to her leg to the crysknife she had fastened in a calf-sheath.
    The banker turned his glare on Jessica. Eyes shifted away from Paul and she saw him ease himself back from the table, freeing himself for action. He had focused on the code word: garment. "Prepare for violence. "
    Kynes directed a speculative look at Jessica, gave a subtle hand signal to Tuek.
    The smuggler lurched to his feet, lifted his flagon. "I'll give you a toast," he said. "To young Paul Atreides, still a lad by his looks, but a man by his actions." 
    Why do they intrude? Jessica asked herself.
    The banker stared now at Kynes, and Jessica saw terror return to the agent's face.
    People began responding all around the table.
    Where Kynes leads, people follow, Jessica thought. He has told us he sides with Paul. What's the secret of his power? It can't be because he's Judge of the Change. That's temporary. And certainly not because he's a civil servant.
    She removed her hand from the crysknife hilt, lifted her flagon to Kynes, who responded in kind.
    Only Paul and the banker-- (Soo-Soo! What an idiotic nickname! Jessica thought.)--remained empty-handed. The banker's attention stayed fixed on Kynes. Paul stared at his plate.
    I was handling it correctly, Paul thought. Why do they interfere? He glanced covertly at the male guests nearest him. Prepare for violence? From whom? Certainly not from that banker fellow.
    Halleck stirred, spoke as though to no one in particular, directing his words over the heads of the guests across from him: "In our society, people shouldn't be quick to take offense. It's frequently suicidal." He looked at the stillsuit manufacturer's daughter beside him. "Don't you think so, miss?"
    "Oh, yes. Yes. Indeed I do," She said. "There's too much violence. It makes me sick. And lots of times no offense is meant, but people die anyway. It doesn't make sense." 
    "Indeed it doesn't," Halleck said.
    Jessica saw the near perfection of the girl's act, realized: That empty-headed little female is not an empty-headed little female. She saw then the pattern of the threat and understood that Halleck, too, had detected it. They had planned to lure Paul with sex. Jessica relaxed. Her son had probably been the first to see it--his training hadn't overlooked that obvious gambit.
    Kynes spoke to the banker: "Isn't another apology in order?" 
    The banker turned a sickly grin toward Jessica, said: "My Lady, I fear I've overindulged in your wines. You serve potent drink at table, and I'm not accustomed to it."
    Jessica heard the venom beneath his tone, spoke sweetly: "When strangers meet, great allowance should be made for differences of custom and training." 
    "Thank you, my Lady," he said.
    The dark-haired companion of the stillsuit manufacturer leaned toward Jessica, said: "The Duke spoke of our being secure here. I do hope that doesn't mean more fighting."
    She was directed to lead the conversation this way, Jessica thought.
    "Likely this will prove unimportant," Jessica said. "But there's so much detail requiring the Duke's personal attention in these times. As long as enmity continues between Atreides and Harkonnen we cannot be too careful. The Duke has sworn kanly. He will leave no Harkonnen agent alive on Arrakis, of course." She glanced at the Guild Bank agent. "And the Conventions, naturally, support him in this." She shifted her attention to Kynes." Is this not so, Dr. Kynes?" 
    "Indeed it is," Kynes said.
    The stillsuit manufacturer pulled his companion gently back. She looked at him, said: "I do believe I'll eat something now. I'd like some of that bird dish you served earlier."
    Jessica signaled a servant, turned to the banker: "And you, sir, were speaking of birds earlier and of their habits. I find so many interesting things about Arrakis. Tell me, where is the spice found? Do the hunters go deep into the desert?"
    "Oh, no, my Lady," he said. "Very little's known of the deep desert. And almost nothing of the southern regions." 
    "There's a tale that a great Mother Lode of spice is to be found in the southern reaches," Kynes said, "but I suspect it was an imaginative invention made solely for purposes of a song. Some daring spice hunters do, on occasion, penetrate into the edge of the central belt, but that's extremely dangerous--navigation is uncertain, storms are frequent. Casualties increase dramatically the farther you operate from Shield Wall bases. It hasn't been found profitable to venture too far south. Perhaps if we had a weather satellite . . ."
    Bewt looked up, spoke around a mouthful of food: "It's said the Fremen travel there, that they go anywhere and have hunted out soaks and sip-wells even in the southern latitudes." 
    "Soaks and sip-wells?" Jessica asked.
    Kynes spoke quickly: "Wild rumors, my Lady. These are known on other planets, not on Arrakis. A soak is a place where water seeps to the surface or near enough to the surface to be found by digging according to certain signs. A sip-well is a form of soak where a person draws water through a straw . . . so it is said." 
    There's deception in his words, Jessica thought. 
    Why is he lying? Paul wondered.
    "How very interesting," Jessica said. And she thought. "It is said . . ." What a curious speech mannerism they have here. If they only knew what it reveals about their dependence on superstitions.
    "I've heard you have a saying," Paul said, "that polish comes from the cities, wisdom from the desert." 
    "There are many sayings on Arrakis," Kynes said.
    Before Jessica could frame a new question, a servant bent over her with a note. She opened it, saw the Duke's handwriting and code signs, scanned it.
    "You'll all be delighted to know," she said, "that our Duke sends his reassurances. The matter which called him away has been settled. The missing carryall has been found. A Harkonnen agent in the crew overpowered the others and flew the machine to a smugglers' base, hoping to sell it there. Both man and machine were turned over to our forces." She nodded to Tuek. 
    The smuggler nodded back.
    Jessica refolded the note, tucked it into her sleeve.
    "I'm glad it didn't come to open battle," the banker said. "The people have such hopes the Atreides will bring peace and prosperity." 
    "Especially prosperity," Bewt said.
    "Shall we have our dessert now?" Jessica asked. "I've had our chef prepare a Caladan sweet: pongi rice in sauce dolsa." 
    "It sounds wonderful," the stillsuit manufacturer said. "Would it be possible to get the recipe?"
    "Any recipe you desire," Jessica said, registering the man for later mention to Hawat. The stillsuit manufacturer was a fearful little climber and could be bought.
    Small talk resumed around her: "Such a lovely fabric . . ." "He is having a setting made to match the jewel . . ." "We might try for a production increase next quarter . . ."
    Jessica stared down at her plate, thinking of the coded part of Leto's message: "The Harkonnens tried to get in a shipment of lasguns. We captured them. This may mean they've succeeded with other shipments. It certainly means they don't place much store in shields. Take appropriate precautions."
    Jessica focused her mind on lasguns, wondering. The white-hot beams of disruptive light could cut through any known substance, provided that substance was not shielded. The fact that feedback from a shield would explode both lasgun and shield did not bother the Harkonnens. Why? A lasgun-shield explosion was a dangerous variable, could be more powerful than atomics, could kill only the gunner and his shielded target.
    The unknowns here filled her with uneasiness.
    Paul said: "I never doubted we'd find the carryall. Once my father moves to solve a problem, he solves it. This is a fact the Harkonnens are beginning to discover."
    He's boasting, Jessica thought. He shouldn't boast. No person who'll be sleeping far below ground level this night as a precaution against lasguns has the right to boast.

    Jessica heard the disturbance in the great hall, turned on the light beside her bed. The clock there had not been properly adjusted to local time, and she had to subtract twenty-one minutes to determine that it was about 2 A.M. 
    The disturbance was loud and incoherent. 
    Is this the Harkonnen attack? she wondered.
    She slipped out of bed, checked the screen monitors to see where her family was. The screen showed Paul asleep in the deep cellar room they'd hastily converted to a bedroom for him. The noise obviously wasn't penetrating to his quarters. There was no one in the Duke's room, his bed was unrumpled. Was he still at the field C.P.?
    There were no screens yet to the front of the house. 
    Jessica stood in the middle of her room, listening.
    There was one shouting, incoherent voice. She heard someone call for Dr. Yueh. Jessica found a robe, pulled it over her shoulders, pushed her feet into slippers, strapped the crysknife to her leg. 
    Again, a voice called out for Yueh.
    Jessica belted the robe around her, stepped into the hallway. Then the thought struck her: What if Leto's hurt?
    The hall seemed to stretch out forever under her running feet. She turned through the arch at the end, dashed past the dining hall and down the passage to the Great Hall, finding the place brightly lighted, all the wall suspensors glowing at maximum.
    To her right near the front entry, she saw two house guards holding Duncan Idaho between them. His head lolled forward, and there was an abrupt, panting silence to the scene.
    One of the house guards spoke accusingly to Idaho: "You see what you did? You woke the Lady Jessica."
    The great draperies billowed behind the men, showing that the front door remained open. There was no sign of the Duke or Yueh. Mapes stood to one side staring coldly at Idaho. She wore a long brown robe with serpentine design at the hem. Her feet were pushed into unlaced desert boots.
    "So I woke the Lady Jessica," Idaho muttered. He lifted his face toward the ceiling, bellowed: "My sword was firs' blooded on Grumman!" 
    Great Mother! He's drunk! Jessica thought.
    Idaho's dark, round face was drawn into a frown. His hair, curling like the fur of a black goat, was plastered with dirt. A jagged rent in his tunic exposed an expanse of the dress shirt he had worn at the dinner party earlier. 
    Jessica crossed to him.
    One of the guards nodded to her without releasing his hold on Idaho. "We didn't know what to do with him, my Lady. He was creating a disturbance out front, refusing to come inside. We were afraid locals might come along and see him. That wouldn't do at all. Give us a bad name here." 
    "Where has he been?" Jessica asked.
    "He escorted one of the young ladies home from the dinner, my Lady. Hawat's orders." 
    "Which young lady?"
    "One of the escort wenches. You understand, my Lady?" He glanced at Mapes, lowered his voice. "They're always calling on Idaho for special surveillance of the ladies." 
    And Jessica thought: So they are. But why is he drunk?
    She frowned, turned to Mapes. "Mapes, bring a stimulant. I'd suggest caffeine. Perhaps there's some of the spice coffee left." 
    Mapes shrugged, headed for the kitchen. Her unlaced desert boots slap-slapped against the stone floor.
    Idaho swung his unsteady head around to peer at an angle toward Jessica. "Killed more'n three hunner' men f'r the Duke," he muttered. "Whadduh wanna know is why'm mere? Can't live unner th' groun' here. Can't live onna groun' here. Wha' kinna place is 'iss, huh?"
    A sound from the side hall entry caught Jessica's attention. She turned, saw Yueh crossing to them, his medical kit swinging in his left hand. He was fully dressed, looked pale, exhausted. The diamond tattoo stood out sharply on his forehead.
    "Th' good docker!" Idaho shouted. "Whad're you, Doc? Splint 'n' pill man?" He turned blearily toward Jessica. "Makin' uh damn fool uh m'self, huh?"
    Jessica frowned, remained silent, wondering: Why would Idaho get drunk? Was he drugged?
    "Too much spice beer," Idaho said, attempting to straighten.
    Mapes returned with a steaming cup in her hands, stopped uncertainly behind Yueh. She looked at Jessica, who shook her head.
    Yueh put his kit on the floor, nodded greeting to Jessica, said: "Spice beer, eh?"
    "Bes' damn stuff ever tas'ed," Idaho said. He tried to pull himself to attention. "My sword was firs' blooded on Grumman! Killed a Harkon . . . Harkon . . . killed 'im f'r th' Duke." 
    Yueh turned, looked at the cup in Mapes' hand. 
    "What is that?" 
    "Caffeine," Jessica said.
    Yueh took the cup, held it toward Idaho. "Drink this, lad." 
    "Don't wan' any more f drink." 
    "Drink it, I say!"
    Idaho's head wobbled toward Yueh, and he stumbled one step ahead, dragging the guards with him. "I'm almighdy fed up with pleasin' th' 'Mperial Universe, Doc. Jus' once, we're gonna do th' thing my way." 
    "After you drink this," Yueh said. "It's just caffeine." 
    " 'Sprolly like all res' uh this place! Damn' sun 'stoo brighd. Nothin' has uh righd color. Ever'thing's wrong or . . . " 
    "Well, it's nighttime now," Yueh said. He spoke reasonably. "Drink this like a good lad. It'll make you feel better." 
    "Don' wanna feel bedder!"
    "We can't argue with him all night," Jessica said. And she thought: This calls for shock treatment.
    "There's no reason for you to stay, my Lady," Yueh said. "I can take care of this."
    Jessica shook her head. She stepped forward, slapped Idaho sharply across the cheek.
    He stumbled back with his guards, glaring at her.
    "This is no way to act in your Duke's home," she said. She snatched the cup from Yueh's hands, spilling part of it, thrust the cup toward Idaho. "Now drink this! That's an order!" 
    Idaho jerked himself upright, scowling down at her. He spoke slowly, with careful and precise enunciation: "I do not take orders from a damn' Harkonnen spy." 
    Yueh stiffened, whirled to face Jessica.
    Her face had gone pale, but she was nodding. It all became clear to her--the broken stems of meaning she had seen in words and actions around her these past few days could now be translated. She found herself in the grip of anger almost too great to contain. It took the most profound of her Bene Gesserit training to quiet her pulse and smooth her breathing. Even then she could feel the blaze flickering.
    They were always calling on Idaho for surveillance of the ladies! 
    She shot a glance at Yueh. The doctor lowered his eyes. 
    "You knew this?" she demanded.
    "I . . . heard rumors, my Lady. But I didn't want to add to your burdens."
    "Hawat!" she snapped. "I want Thufir Hawat brought to me immediately!" 
    "But, my Lady . . . " 
    "Immediately!"
    It has to be Hawat, she thought. Suspicion such as this could come from no other source without being discarded immediately.
    Idaho shook his head, mumbled. "Chuck th' whole damn thing."
    Jessica looked down at the cup in her hand, abruptly dashed its contents across Idaho's face. "Lock him in one of the guest rooms of the east wing," she ordered. "Let him sleep it off." 
    The two guards stared at her unhappily. One ventured: "Perhaps we should take him someplace else, m'Lady. We could . . . " 
    "He's supposed to be here!" Jessica snapped. "He has a job to do here." Her voice dripped bitterness. "He's so good at watching the ladies." 
    The guard swallowed.
    "Do you know where the Duke is?" she demanded. 
    "He's at the command post, my Lady." 
    "Is Hawat with him?" 
    "Hawat's in the city, my Lady."
    "You will bring Hawat to me at once," Jessica said. "I will be in my sitting room when he arrives." 
    "But, my Lady . . . "
    "If necessary, I will call the Duke," she said. "I hope it will not be necessary. I would not want to disturb him with this."
    "Yes, my Lady."
    Jessica thrust the empty cup into Mapes' hands, met the questioning stare of the blue-within-blue eyes. "You may return to bed, Mapes." 
    "You're sure you'll not need me?" 
    Jessica smiled grimly. "I'm sure."
    "Perhaps this could wait until tomorrow," Yueh said. "I could give you a sedative and . . . "
    "You will return to your quarters and leave me to handle this my way," she said. She patted his arm to take the sting out of her command. "This is the only way."
    Abruptly, head high, she turned and stalked off through the house to her rooms. Cold walls . . . passages . . . a familiar door . . . She jerked the door open, strode in, and slammed it behind her. Jessica stood there glaring at the shield-blanked windows of her sitting room. Hawat! Could he be the one the Harkonnens bought? We shall see.
    Jessica crossed to the deep, old-fashioned armchair with an embroidered cover of schlag skin, moved the chair into position to command the door. She was suddenly very conscious of the crysknife in its sheath on her leg. She removed the sheath and strapped it to her arm, tested the drop of it. Once more, she glanced around the room, placing everything precisely in her mind against any emergency: the chaise near the corner, the straight chairs along the wall, the two low tables, her stand-mounted zither beside the door to her bedroom.
    Pale rose light glowed from the suspensor lamps. She dimmed them, sat down in the armchair, patting the upholstery, appreciating the chair's regal heaviness for this occasion.
    Now, let him come, she thought. We shall see what we shall see. And she prepared herself in the Bene Gesserit fashion for the wait, accumulating patience, saving her strength.
    Sooner than she had expected, a rap sounded at the door and Hawat entered at her command.
    She watched him without moving from the chair, seeing the crackling sense of drug-induced energy in his movements, seeing the fatigue beneath. Hawat's rheumy old eyes glittered. His leathery skin appeared faintly yellow in the room's light, and there was a wide, wet stain on the sleeve of his knife arm. 
    She smelled blood there.
    Jessica gestured to one of the straight-backed chairs, said: "Bring that chair and sit facing me."
    Hawat bowed, obeyed. That drunken fool of an Idaho! he thought. He studied Jessica's face, wondering how he could save this situation.
    "It's long past time to clear the air between us," Jessica said. 
    "What troubles my Lady?" He sat down, placed hands on knees.
    "Don't play coy with me!" she snapped. "If Yueh didn't tell you why I summoned you, then one of your spies in my household did. Shall we be at least that honest with each other?" 
    "As you wish, my Lady."
    "First, you will answer me one question," she said. "Are you now a Harkonnen agent?"
    Hawat surged half out of his chair, his face dark with fury, demanding: "You dare insult me so?" 
    "Sit down," she said. "You insulted me so." 
    Slowly, he sank back into the chair.
    And Jessica, reading the signs of this face that she knew so well, allowed herself a deep breath. It isn't Hawat.
    "Now I know you remain loyal to my Duke," she said. "I'm prepared, therefore, to forgive your affront to me." 
    "Is there something to forgive?"
    Jessica scowled, wondering: Shall I play my trump? Shall I tell him of the Duke's daughter I've carried within me these few weeks? No . . . Leto himself doesn't know. This would only complicate his life, divert him in a time when he must concentrate on our survival. There is yet time to use this.
    "A Truthsayer would solve this," she said, "but we have no Truthsayer qualified by the High Board." 
    "As you say. We've no Truthsayer."
    "Is there a traitor among us?" she asked. "I've studied our people with great care. Who could it be? Not Gurney. Certainly not Duncan. Their lieutenants are not strategically enough placed to consider. It's not you, Thufir. It cannot be Paul. I know it's not me. Dr. Yueh, then? Shall I call him in and put him to the test?" 
    "You know that's an empty gesture," Hawat said. "He's conditioned by the High College. That I know for certain." 
    "Not to mention that his wife was a Bene Gesserit slain by the Harkonnens," Jessica said.
    "So that's what happened to her," Hawat said.
    "Haven't you heard the hate in his voice when he speaks the Harkonnen name?" 
    "You know I don't have the ear," Hawat said. 
    "What brought this base suspicion on me?" she asked.
    Hawat frowned. "My Lady puts her servant in an impossible position. My first loyalty is to the Duke."
    "I'm prepared to forgive much because of that loyalty," she said.
    "And again I must ask: Is there something to forgive?" 
    "Stalemate?" she asked. 
    He shrugged.
    "Let us discuss something else for a minute, then," she said. "Duncan Idaho, the admirable fighting man whose abilities at guarding and surveillance are so esteemed. Tonight, he overindulged in something called spice beer. I hear reports that others among our people have been stupefied by this concoction. Is that true?" 
    "You have your reports, my Lady." 
    "So I do. Don't you see this drinking as a symptom, Thufir?" 
    "My Lady speaks riddles."
    "Apply your Mentat abilities to it!" she snapped. "What's the problem with Duncan and the others? I can tell you in four words--they have no home." 
    He jabbed a finger at the floor. "Arrakis, that's their home." 
    "Arrakis is an unknown! Caladan was their home, but we've uprooted them. They have no home. And they fear the Duke's failing them."
    He stiffened. "Such talk from one of the men would be cause for--"
    "Oh, stop that, Thufir. Is it defeatist or treacherous for a doctor to diagnose a disease correctly? My only intention is to cure the disease." 
    "The Duke gives me charge over such matters." 
    "But you understand I have a certain natural concern over the progress of this disease," she said. "And perhaps you'll grant I have certain abilities along these lines."
    Will I have to shock him severely? she wondered. He needs shaking up--something to break him from routine.
    "There could be many interpretations for your concern," Hawat said. He shrugged.
    "Then you've already convicted me?"
    "Of course not, my Lady. But I cannot afford to take any chances, the situation being what it is."
    "A threat to my son got past you right here in this house," she said. "Who took that chance?" 
    His face darkened. "I offered my resignation to the Duke." 
    "Did you offer your resignation to me . . . or to Paul?" 
    Now he was openly angry, betraying it in quickness of breathing, in dilation of nostrils, a steady stare. She saw a pulse beating at his temple.
    "I'm the Duke's man," he said, biting off the words.
    "There is no traitor," she said. "The threat's something else. Perhaps it has to do with the lasguns. Perhaps they'll risk secreting a few lasguns with timing mechanisms aimed at house shields. Perhaps they'll . . . "
    "And who could tell after the blast if the explosion wasn't atomic?" he asked. "No, my Lady. They'll not risk anything that illegal. Radiation lingers. The evidence is hard to erase. No. They'll observe most of the forms. It has to be a traitor." 
    "You're the Duke's man," she sneered. "Would you destroy him in the effort to save him?"
    He took a deep breath, then: "If you're innocent, you'll have my most abject apologies."
    "Look at you now, Thufir," she said. "Humans live best when each has his own place, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things. Destroy the place and destroy the person. You and I, Thufir, of all those who love the Duke, are most ideally situated to destroy the other's place. Could I not whisper suspicions about you into the Duke's ear at night? When would he be most susceptible to such whispering, Thufir? Must I draw it for you more clearly?" 
    "You threaten me?" he growled.
    "Indeed not. I merely point out to you that someone is attacking us through the basic arrangement of our lives. It's clever, diabolical. I propose to negate this attack by so ordering our lives that there'll be no chinks for such barbs to enter." 
    "You accuse me of whispering baseless suspicions?" 
    "Baseless, yes." 
    "You'd meet this with your own whispers?" 
    "Your life is compounded of whispers, not mine, Thufir." 
    "Then you question my abilities?"
    She sighed. "Thufir, I want you to examine your own emotional involvement in this. The natural human's an animal without logic. Your projections of logic onto all affairs is unnatural, but suffered to continue for its usefulness. You're the embodiment of logic--a Mentat. Yet, your problem solutions are concepts that, in a very real sense, are projected outside yourself, there to be studied and rolled around, examined from all sides."
    "You think now to teach me my trade?" he asked, and he did not try to hide the disdain in his voice.
    "Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to it," she said. "But it's a human trait that when we encounter personal problems, those things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our logic to scan. We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual, deep-seated thing that's really chewing on us."
    "You're deliberately attempting to undermine my faith in my abilities as a Mentat," he rasped. "Were I to find one of our people attempting thus to sabotage any other weapon in our arsenal, I should not hesitate to denounce and destroy him." 
    "The finest Mentats have a healthy respect for the error factor in their computations," she said. 
    "I've never said otherwise!"
    "Then apply yourself to these symptoms we've both seen: drunkenness among the men, quarrels--they gossip and exchange wild rumors about Arrakis; they ignore the most simple--" 
    "Idleness, no more," he said. "Don't try to divert my attention by trying to make a simple matter appear mysterious." 
    She stared at him, thinking of the Duke's men rubbing their woes together in the barracks until you could almost smell the charge there, like burnt insulation. They're becoming like the men of the pre-Guild legend, she thought: Like the men of the lost star-searcher, Ampoliros--sick at their guns--forever seeking, forever prepared and forever unready.
    "Why have you never made full use of my abilities in your service to the Duke?" she asked. "Do you fear a rival for your position?"
    He glared at her, the old eyes blazing. "I know some of the training they give you Bene Gesserit . . . " He broke off, scowling.
    "Go ahead, say it," she said. "Bene Gesserit witches." 
    "I know something of the real training they give you," he said. "I've seen it come out in Paul. I'm not fooled by what your schools tell the public: you exist only to serve."
    The shock must be severe and he's almost ready for it, she thought.
    "You listen respectfully to me in Council," she said, "yet you seldom heed my advice. Why?"
    "I don't trust your Bene Gesserit motives," he said. "You may think you can look through a man; you may think you can make a man do exactly what you--" 
    "You poor fool, Thufir!" she raged. 
    He scowled, pushing himself back in the chair.
    "Whatever rumors you've heard about our schools," she said, "the truth is far greater. If I wished to destroy the Duke . . . or you, or any other person within my reach, you could not stop me." 
    And she thought: Why do I let pride drive such words out of me? This is not the way I was trained. This is not how I must shock him.
    Hawat slipped a hand beneath his tunic where he kept a tiny projector of poison darts. She wears no shield, he thought. Is this just a brag she makes? I could slay her now . . . but, ah-h-h-h, the consequences if I'm wrong.
    Jessica saw the gesture toward his pocket, said: "Let us pray violence shall never be necessary between us." 
    "A worthy prayer," he agreed.
    "Meanwhile, the sickness spreads among us," she said. "I must ask you again: Isn't it more reasonable to suppose the Harkonnens have planted this suspicion to pit the two of us against each other?" 
    "We appear to've returned to stalemate," he said. 
    She sighed, thinking: He's almost ready for it.
    "The Duke and I are father and mother surrogates to our people," she said. "The position--" 
    "He hasn't married you," Hawat said.
    She forced herself to calmness, thinking: A good riposte, that.
    "But he'll not marry anyone else," she said. "Not as long as I live. And we are surrogates, as I've said. To break up this natural order in our affairs, to disturb, disrupt, and confuse us--which target offers itself most enticingly to the Harkonnens?"
    He sensed the direction she was taking, and his brows drew down in a lowering scowl.
    "The Duke?" she asked. "Attractive target, yes, but no one with the possible exception of Paul is better guarded. Me? I tempt them, surely, but they must know the Bene Gesserit make difficult targets. And there's a better target, one whose duties create, necessarily, a monstrous blind spot. One to whom suspicion is as natural as breathing. One who builds his entire life on innuendo and mystery." She darted her right hand toward him. "You!" 
    Hawat started to leap from his chair. 
    "I have not dismissed you, Thufir!" she flared.
    The old Mentat almost fell back into the chair, so quickly did his muscles betray him.
    She smiled without mirth.
    "Now you know something of the real training they give us," she said.
    Hawat tried to swallow in a dry throat. Her command had been regal, preemptory--uttered in a tone and manner he had found completely irresistible. His body had obeyed her before he could think about it. Nothing could have prevented his response--not logic, not passionate anger . . . nothing. To do what she had done spoke of a sensitive, intimate knowledge of the person thus commanded, a depth of control he had not dreamed possible.
    "I have said to you before that we should understand each other," she said. "I meant you should understand me. I already understand you. And I tell you now that your loyalty to the Duke is all that guarantees your safety with me." 
    He stared at her, wet his lips with his tongue.
    "If I desired a puppet, the Duke would marry me," she said. "He might even think he did it of his own free will." 
    Hawat lowered his head, looked upward through his sparse lashes. Only the most rigid control kept him from calling the guard. Control . . . and the suspicion now that woman might not permit it. His skin crawled with the memory of how she had controlled him. In the moment of hesitation, she could have drawn a weapon and killed him!
    Does every human have this blind spot? he wondered. Can any of us be ordered into action before he can resist? The idea staggered him. Who could stop a person with such power?
    "You've glimpsed the fist within the Bene Gesserit glove," she said. "Few glimpse it and live. And what I did was a relatively simple thing for us. You've not seen my entire arsenal. Think on that," 
    "Why aren't you out destroying the Duke's enemies?" he asked.
    "What would you have me destroy?" she asked. "Would you have me make a weakling of our Duke, have him forever leaning on me?" 
    "But, with such power . . . "
    "Power's a two-edged sword, Thufir," she said; "You think: 'How easy for her to shape a human tool to thrust into an enemy's vitals.' True, Thufir; even into your vitals. Yet, what would I accomplish? If enough of us Bene Gesserit did this, wouldn't it make all Bene Gesserit suspect? We don't want that, Thufir. We do not wish to destroy ourselves." She nodded. "We truly exist only to serve." 
    "I cannot answer you," he said. "You know I cannot answer." 
    "You'll say nothing about what has happened here to anyone," she said. "I know you, Thufir."
    "My Lady . . . " Again the old man tried to swallow in a dry throat.
    And he thought: She has great powers, yes. But would these not make her an even more formidable tool for the Harkonnens?
    "The Duke could be destroyed as quickly by his friends as by his enemies," she said. "I trust now you'll get to the bottom of this suspicion and remove it." 
    "If it proves baseless," he said. 
    "If," she sneered. 
    "If," he said.
    "You are tenacious," she said.
    "Cautious," he said, "and aware of the error factor." 
    "Then I'll pose another question for you: What does it mean to you that you stand before another human, that you are bound and helpless and the other human holds a knife at your throat--yet this other human refrains from killing you, frees you from your bonds and gives you the knife to use as you will?"
    She lifted herself out of the chair, turned her back on him. "You may go now, Thufir."
    The old Mentat arose, hesitated, hand creeping toward the deadly weapon beneath his tunic. He was reminded of the bull ring and of the Duke's father (who'd been brave, no matter what his other failings) and one day of the corrida long ago: The fierce black beast had stood there, head bowed, immobilized and confused. The Old Duke had turned his back on the horns, cape thrown flamboyantly over one arm, while cheers rained down from the stands.
    I am the bull and she the matador, Hawat thought. He withdrew his hand from the weapon, glanced at the sweat glistening in his empty palm.
    And he knew that whatever the facts proved to be in the end, he would never forget this moment nor lose this sense of supreme admiration for the Lady Jessica. 
    Quietly, he turned and left the room.
    Jessica lowered her gaze from the reflection in the windows, turned, and stared at the closed door.
    "Now we'll see some proper action," she whispered.

    Leto stood in the foyer of his house, studying a note by the light of a single suspensor lamp. Dawn was yet a few hours away, and he felt his tiredness. A Fremen messenger had brought the note to the outer guard just now as the Duke arrived from his command post.
    The note read: "A column of smoke by day, a pillar of fire by night." 
    There was no signature.
    What does it mean? he wondered.
    The messenger had gone without waiting for an answer and before he could be questioned. He had slipped into the night like some smoky shadow.
    Leto pushed the paper into a tunic pocket, thinking to show it to Hawat later. He brushed a lock of hair from his forehead, took a sighing breath. The anti-fatigue pills were beginning to wear thin. It had been a long two days since the dinner party and longer than that since he had slept.
    On top of all the military problems, there'd been the disquieting session with Hawat, the report on his meeting with Jessica.
    Should I waken Jessica? he wondered. There's no reason to play the secrecy game with her any longer. Or is there? 
    Blast and damn that Duncan Idaho!
    He shook his head. No, not Duncan. I was wrong not to take Jessica into my confidence from the first. I must do it now, before more damage is done.
    The decision made him feel better, and he hurried from the foyer through the Great Hall and down the passages toward the family wing.
    At the turn where the passages split to the service area, he paused. A strange mewling came from somewhere down the service passage. Leto put his left hand to the switch on his shield belt, slipped his kindjal into his right hand. The knife conveyed a sense of reassurance. That strange sound had sent a chill through him.
    Softly, the Duke moved down the service passage, cursing the inadequate illumination. The smallest of suspensors had been spaced about eight meters apart along here and tuned to their dimmest level. The dark stone walls swallowed the light.
    A dull blob stretching across the floor appeared out of the gloom ahead.
    Leto hesitated, almost activated his shield, but refrained because that would limit his movements, his hearing . . . and because the captured shipment of lasguns had left him filled with doubts.
    Silently, he moved toward the grey blob, saw that it was a human figure, a man face down on the stone. Leto turned him over with a foot, knife poised, bent close in the dim light to see the face. It was the smuggler, Tuek, a wet stain down his chest. The dead eyes stared with empty darkness. Leto touched the stain--warm.
    How could this man be dead here? Leto asked himself. Who killed him?
    The mewling sound was louder here. It came from ahead and down the side passage to the central room where they had installed the main shield generator for the house.
    Hand on belt switch, kindjal poised, the Duke skirted the body, slipped down the passage and peered around the corner toward the shield generator room.
    Another grey blob lay stretched on the floor a few paces away, and he saw at once this was the source of the noise. The shape crawled toward him with painful slowness, gasping, mumbling.
    Leto stilled his sudden constriction of fear, darted down the passage, crouched beside the crawling figure. It was Mapes, the Fremen housekeeper, her hair tumbled around her face, clothing disarrayed. A dull shininess of dark stain spread from her back along her side. He touched her shoulder and she lifted herself on her elbows, head tipped up to peer at him, the eyes black-shadowed emptiness.
    "S'you," she gasped. "Killed . . . guard . . . sent . . . get . . . Tuek . . . escape . . . m'Lady . . . you . . . you . . . here . . . no . . . " She flopped forward, her head thumping against the stone.
    Leto felt for pulse at the temples. There was none. He looked at the stain: she'd been stabbed in the back. Who? His mind raced. Did she mean someone had killed a guard? And Tuek--had Jessica sent for him? Why?
    He started to stand up. A sixth sense warned him. He flashed a hand toward the shield switch--too late. A numbing shock slammed his arm aside. He felt pain there, saw a dart protruding from the sleeve, sensed paralysis spreading from it up his arm. It took an agonizing effort to lift his head and look down the passage.
    Yueh stood in the open door of the generator room. His face reflected yellow from the light of a single, brighter suspensor above the door. There was stillness from the room behind him--no sound of generators.
    Yueh! Leto thought. He's sabotaged the house generators! We 're wide open!
    Yueh began walking toward him, pocketing a dartgun.
    Leto found he could still speak, gasped: "Yueh! How?" Then the paralysis reached his legs and he slid to the floor with his back propped against the stone wall.
    Yueh's face carried a look of sadness as he bent over, touched Leto's forehead. The Duke found he could feel the touch, but it was remote . . . dull.
    "The drug on the dart is selective," Yueh said "You can speak, but I'd advise against it." He glanced down the hall, and again bent over Leto, pulled out the dart, tossed it aside. The sound of the dart clattering on the stones was faint and distant to the Duke's ears. 
    It can't be Yueh, Leto thought. He's conditioned. 
    "How?" Leto whispered.
    "I'm sorry, my dear Duke, but there are things which will make greater demands than this." He touched the diamond tattoo on his forehead. "I find it very strange, myself--an override on my pyretic conscience--but I wish to kill a man. Yes, I actually wish it. I will stop at nothing to do it."
    He looked down at the Duke. "Oh, not you, my dear Duke. The Baron Harkonnen. I wish to kill the Baron." 
    "Bar . . . on Har . . . "
    "Be quiet, please, my poor Duke. You haven't much time. That peg tooth I put in your mouth after the tumble at Narcal--that tooth must be replaced, in a moment, I'll render you unconscious and replace that tooth." He opened his hand, stared at something in it. "An exact duplicate, its core shaped most exquisitely like a nerve. It'll escape the usual detectors, even a fast scanning. But if you bite down hard on it, the cover crushes. Then, when you expel your breath sharply, you fill the air around you with a poison gas--most deadly."
    Leto stared up at Yueh, seeing madness in the man's eyes, the perspiration along brown and chin.
    "You were dead anyway, my poor Duke," Yueh said. "But you will get close to the Baron before you die. He'll believe you're stupefied by drugs beyond any dying effort to attack him. And you will be drugged--and tied. But attack can take strange forms. And you will remember the tooth. The tooth, Duke Leto Atreides. You will remember the tooth."
    The old doctor leaned closer and closer until his face and drooping mustache dominated Leto's narrowing vision. 
    "The tooth," Yueh muttered. 
    "Why?" Leto whispered.
    Yueh lowered himself to one knee beside the Duke. "I made a shaitan's bargain with the Baron. And I must be certain he has fulfilled his half of it. When I see him, I'll know. When I look at the Baron, then I will know. But I'll never enter his presence without the price. You're the price, my poor Duke. And I'll know when I see him. My poor Wanna taught me many things, and one is to see certainty of truth when the stress is great. I cannot do it always, but when I see the Baron--then, I will know."
    Leto tried to look down at the tooth in Yueh's hand. He felt this was happening in a nightmare--it could not be.
    Yueh's purple lips turned up in a grimace. "I'll not get close enough to the Baron, or I'd do this myself. No. I'll be detained at a safe distance. But you . . . ah, now! You, my lovely weapon! He'll want you close to him--to gloat over you, to boast a little." 
    Leto found himself almost hypnotized by a muscle on the left side of Yueh's jaw. The muscle twisted when the man spoke.
    Yueh leaned closer. "And you, my good Duke, my precious Duke, you must remember this tooth." He held it up between thumb and forefinger. "It will be all that remains to you." 
    Leto's mouth moved without sound, then: "Refuse." 
    "Ah-h, no! You mustn't refuse. Because, in return for this small service. I'm doing a thing for you. I will save your son and your woman. No other can do it. They can be removed to a place where no Harkonnen can reach them." 
    "How . . . save . . . them?" Leto whispered.
    "By making it appear they're dead, by secreting them among people who draw knife at hearing the Harkonnen name, who hate the Harkonnens so much they'll burn a chair in which a Harkonnen has sat, salt the ground over which a Harkonnen has walked." He touched Leto's jaw. "Can you feel anything in your jaw?" 
    The Duke found that he could not answer. He sensed distant tugging, saw Yueh's hand come up with the ducal signet ring.
    "For Paul," Yueh said. "You'll be unconscious presently. Good-by, my poor Duke. When next we meet we'll have no time for conversation."
    Cool remoteness spread upward from Leto's jaw, across his cheeks. The shadowy, hall narrowed to a pinpoint with Yueh's purple lips centered in it.
    "Remember the tooth!" Yueh hissed. "The tooth!"

    Jessica awoke in the dark, feeling premonition in the stillness around her. She could not understand why her mind and body felt so sluggish. Skin raspings of fear ran along her nerves. She thought of sitting up and turning on a light, but something stayed the decision. Her mouth felt . . . strange. 
    Lump-lump-lump-lump!
    It was a dull sound, directionless in the dark. Somewhere.
    The waiting moment was packed with time, with rustling needle-stick movements.
    She began to feel her body, grew aware of bindings on wrists and ankles, a gag in her mouth. She was on her side, hands tied behind her. She tested the bindings, realized they were krimskell fiber, would only claw tighter as she pulled. 
    And now, she remembered.
    There had been movement in the darkness of her bedroom, something wet and pungent slapped against her face, filling her mouth, hands grasping for her. She had gasped--one indrawn breath--sensing the narcotic in the wetness. Consciousness had receded, sinking her into a black bin of terror.
    It has come, she thought. How simple it was to subdue the Bene Gesserit. All it took was treachery. Hawat was right. 
    She forced herself not to pull on her bindings.
    This is not my bedroom, she thought. They've taken me someplace else.
    Slowly, she marshaled the inner calmness.
    She grew aware of the smell of her own stale sweat with its chemical infusion of fear.
    Where is Paul? she asked herself. My son--what have they done to him?
    Calmness.
    She forced herself to it, using the ancient routines. 
    But terror remained so near. 
    Leto? Where are you, Leto?
    She sensed a diminishing in the dark. It began with shadows. Dimensions separated, became new thorns of awareness. White. A line under a door. 
    I'm on the floor.
    People walking. She sensed it through the floor.
    Jessica squeezed back the memory of terror. I must remain calm, alert, and prepared. I may get only one chance. Again, she forced the inner calmness.
    The ungainly thumping of her heartbeats evened, shaping out time. She counted back. I was unconscious about an hour. She closed her eyes, focused her awareness onto the approaching footsteps.
    Four people.
    She counted the differences in their steps.
    I must pretend I'm still unconscious. She relaxed against the cold floor, testing her body's readiness, heard a door open, sensed increased light through her eyelids.
    Feet approached: someone standing over her.
    "You are awake," rumbled a basso voice. "Do not pretend." 
    She opened her eyes.
    The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood over her. Around them, she recognized the cellar room where Paul had slept, saw his cot at one side--empty. Suspensor lamps were brought in by guards, distributed near the open door. There was a glare of light in the hallway beyond that hurt her eyes.
    She looked up at the Baron. He wore a yellow cape that bulged over his portable suspensors. The fat cheeks were two cherubic mounds beneath spider-black eyes.
    "The drug was timed," he rumbled. "We knew to the minute when you'd be coming out of it."
    How could that be? she wondered. They 'd have to know my exact weight, my metabolism, my . . . Yueh!
    "Such a pity you must remain gagged," the Baron said. "We could have such an interesting conversation." 
    Yueh's the only one it could be, she thought. How? 
    The Baron glanced behind him at the door. "Come in, Piter."
    She had never before seen the man who entered to stand beside the Baron, but the face was known--and the man: Piter de Vries, the Mentat-Assassin. She studied him--hawk features, blue-ink eyes that suggested he was a native of Arrakis, but subtleties of movement and stance told her he was not. And his flesh was too well firmed with water. He was tall, though slender, and something about him suggested effeminacy.
    "Such a pity we cannot have our conversation, my dear Lady Jessica." the Baron said. "However, I'm aware of your abilities." He glanced at the Mentat. "Isn't that true, Piter?" 
    "As you say, Baron," the man said.
    The voice was tenor. It touched her spine with a wash of coldness. She had never heard such a chill voice. To one with the Bene Gesserit training, the voice screamed: Killer!
    "I have a surprise for Piter," the Baron said. "He thinks he has come here to collect his reward--you, Lady Jessica. But I wish to demonstrate a thing: that he does not really want you." 
    "You play with me, Baron?" Piter asked, and he smiled.
    Seeing that smile, Jessica wondered that the Baron did not leap to defend himself from this Piter. Then she corrected herself. The Baron could not read that smile. He did not have the Training.
    "In many ways, Piter is quite naive," the Baron said. "He doesn't admit to himself what a deadly creature you are, Lady Jessica. I'd show him, but it'd be a foolish risk." The Baron smiled at Piter, whose face had become a waiting mask. "I know what Piter really wants. Piter wants power."
    "You promised I could have her," Piter said. The tenor voice had lost some of its cold reserve.
    Jessica heard the clue-tones in the man's voice, allowed herself an inward shudder. How could the Baron have made such an animal out of a Mentat?
    "I give you a choice, Piter," the Baron said. 
    "What choice?"
    The Baron snapped fat fingers. "This woman and exile from the Imperium, or the Duchy of Atreides on Arrakis to rule as you see fit in my name." 
    Jessica watched the Baron's spider eyes study Piter. 
    "You could be Duke here in all but name," the Baron said.
    Is my Leto dead, then? Jessica asked herself. She felt a silent wail begin somewhere in her mind.
    The Baron kept his attention on the Mentat. "Understand yourself, Piter. You want her because she was a Duke's woman, a symbol of his power--beautiful, useful, exquisitely trained for her role. But an entire duchy, Piter! That's more than a symbol; that's the reality. With it you could have many women . . . and more." 
    "You do not joke with Piter?"
    The Baron turned with that dancing lightness the suspensors gave him. "Joke? I? Remember--I am giving up the boy. You heard what the traitor said about the lad's training. They are alike, this mother and son--deadly." The Baron smiled. "I must go now. I will send in the guard I've reserved for this moment. He's stone deaf. His orders will be to convey you on the first leg of your journey into exile. He will subdue this woman if he sees her gain control of you. He'll not permit you to untie her gag until you're off Arrakis. If you choose not to leave . . . he has other orders." 
    "You don't have to leave," Piter said. "I've chosen." 
    "Ah, hah!" the Baron chortled. "Such quick decision can mean only one thing." 
    "I will take the duchy," Piter said.
    And Jessica thought: Doesn't Piter know the Baron's lying to him? But--how could he know? He's a twisted Mentat.
    The Baron glanced down at Jessica. "Is it not wonderful that I know Piter so well? I wagered with my Master at Arms that this would be Piter's choice. Hah! Well, I leave now. This is much better. Ah-h, much better. You understand, Lady Jessica? I hold no rancor toward you. It's a necessity. Much better this way. Yes. And I've not actually ordered you destroyed. When it's asked of me what happened to you, I can shrug it off in all truth." 
    "You leave it to me then?" Piter asked.
    "The guard I send you will take your orders," the Baron said. "Whatever's done I leave to you." He stared at Piter. "Yes. There will be no blood on my hands here. It's your decision. Yes. I know nothing of it. You will wait until I've gone before doing whatever you must do. Yes. Well . . . ah, yes. Yes. Good." 
    He fears the questioning of a Truthsayer, Jessica thought. Who? Ah-h-h, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen, of course! If he knows he must face her questions, then the Emperor is in on this for sure. Ah-h-h-h, my poor Leto.
    With one last glance at Jessica, the Baron turned, went out the door. She followed him with her eyes, thinking: It's as the Reverend Mother warned--too potent an adversary.
    Two Harkonnen troopers entered. Another, his face a scarred mask, followed and stood in the doorway with drawn lasgun.
    The deaf one, Jessica thought, studying the scarred face. The Baron knows I could use the Voice on any other man.
    Scarface looked at Piter. "We've the boy on a litter outside. What are your orders?"
    Piter spoke to Jessica. "I'd thought of binding you by a threat held over your son, but I begin to see that would not have worked, I let emotion cloud reason. Bad policy for a Mentat." He looked at the first pair of troopers, turning so the deaf one could read his lips: "Take them into the desert as the traitor suggested for the boy. His plan is a good one. The worms will destroy all evidence. Their bodies must never be found." 
    "You don't wish to dispatch them yourself?" Scarface asked. 
    He reads lips, Jessica thought.
    "I follow my Baron's example," Piter said. "Take them where the traitor said."
    Jessica heard the harsh Mentat control in Piter's voice, thought: He, too, fears the Truthsayer.
    Piter shrugged, turned, and went through the doorway. He hesitated there, and Jessica thought he might turn back for a last look at her, but he went out without turning.
    "Me, I wouldn't like the thought of facing that Truthsayer after this night's work," Scarface said.
    "You ain't likely ever to run into that old witch," one of the other troopers said. He went around to Jessica's head, bent over her. "It ain't getting our work done standing around here chattering. Take her feet and--" 
    "Why'n't we kill 'em here?" Scarface asked.
    "Too messy," the first one said. "Unless you wants to strangle'em. Me, I likes a nice straightforward job. Drop 'em on the desert like that traitor said, cut 'em once or twice, leave 'the evidence for the worms. Nothing to clean up afterwards." 
    "Yeah . . . well, I guess you're right," Scarface said.
    Jessica listened to them, watching, registering. But the gag blocked her Voice, and there was the deaf one to consider.
    Scarface holstered his lasgun, took her feet. They lifted her like a sack of grain, maneuvered her through the door and dumped her onto a suspensor-buoyed litter with another bound figure. As they turned her, fitting her to the litter, she saw her companion's face--Paul! He was bound, but not gagged. His face was no more than ten centimeters from hers, eyes closed, his breathing even. 
    Is he drugged? she wondered.
    The troopers lifted the litter, and Paul's eyes opened the smallest fraction--dark slits staring at her.
    He mustn't try the Voice! she prayed. The deaf guard!
    Paul's eyes closed.
    He had been practicing the awareness-breathing, calming his mind, listening to their captors. The deaf one posed a problem, but Paul contained his despair. The mind-calming Bene Gesserit regimen his mother had taught him kept him poised, ready to expand any opportunity.
    Paul allowed himself another slit-eyed inspection of his mother's face. She appeared unharmed. Gagged, though.
    He wondered who could've captured her. His own captivity was plain enough--to bed with a capsule prescribed by Yueh, awaking to find himself bound to this litter. Perhaps a similar thing had befallen her. Logic said the traitor was Yueh, but he held final decision in abeyance. There was no understanding it--a Suk doctor a traitor.
    The litter tipped slightly as the Harkonnen troopers maneuvered it through a doorway into starlit night. A suspensor-buoy rasped against the doorway. Then they were on sand, feet grating in it. A 'thopter wing loomed overhead, blotting the stars. The litter settled to the ground.
    Paul's eyes adjusted to the faint light. He recognized the deaf trooper as the man who opened the 'thopter door, peered inside at the green gloom illuminated by the instrument panel.
    "This the 'thopter we're supposed to use?" he asked, and turned to watch his companion's lips.
    "It's the one the traitor said was fixed for desert work," the other said.
    Scarface nodded. "But it's one of them little liaison jobs. Ain't room in there for more'n them an' two of us."
    "Two's enough," said the litter-bearer, moving up close and presenting his lips for reading. "We can take care of it from here on, Kinet."
    "The Baron he told me to make sure what happened to them two," Scarface said.
    "What you so worried about?" asked another trooper from behind the litter-bearer.
    "She is a Bene Gesserit witch," the deaf one said. "They have powers."
    "Ah-h-h . . . "The litter-bearer made the sign of the fist at his ear. "One of them, eh? Know whatcha mean."
    The trooper behind him grunted. "She'll be worm meat soon enough. Don't suppose even a Bene Gesserit witch has powers over one of them big worms. Eh, Czigo?" He nudged the litter-bearer.
    "Yee-up," the litter-bearer said. He returned to the litter, took Jessica's shoulders. "C'mon, Kinet. You can go along if you wants to make sure what happens." 
    "It is nice of you to invite me, Czigo," Scarface said.
    Jessica felt herself lifted, the wing shadow spinning--stars. She was pushed into the rear of the 'thopter, her krimskell fiber bindings examined, and she was strapped down. Paul was jammed in beside her, strapped securely, and she noted his bonds were simple rope.
    Scarface, the deaf one they called Kinet, took his place in front. The litter-bearer, the one they called Czigo, came around and took the other front seat.
    Kinet closed his door, bent to the controls. The 'thopter took off in a wing-tucked surge, headed south over the Shield Wall. Czigo tapped his companion's shoulder, said: "Whyn't you turn around and keep an eye on them two?" 
    "Sure you know the way to go?" Kinet watched Czigo's lips. 
    "I listened to the traitor same's you."
    Kinet swiveled his seat. Jessica saw the glint of starlight on a lasgun in his hand. The 'thopter's light-walled interior seemed to collect illumination as her eyes adjusted, but the guard's scarred face remained dim. Jessica tested her seat belt, found it loose. She felt roughness in the strap against her left arm, realized the strap had been almost severed, would snap at a sudden jerk.
    Has someone been at this 'thopter, preparing it for us? she wondered. Who? Slowly, she twisted her bound feet clear of Paul's.
    "Sure do seem a shame to waste a good-looking woman like this," Scarface said. "You ever have any highborn types?" He turned to look at the pilot.
    "Bene Gesserit ain't all highborn," the pilot said. 
    "But they all looks heighty."
    He can see me plain enough, Jessica thought. She brought her bound legs up onto the seat, curled into a sinuous ball, staring at Scarface.
    "Real pretty, she is," Kinet said. He wet his lips with his tongue. "Sure do seem a shame." He looked at Czigo.
    "You thinking what I think you're thinking?" the pilot asked.
    "Who'd be to know?" the guard asked. "Afterwards . . . " He shrugged. "I just never had me no highborns. Might never get a chance like this one again."
    "You lay a hand on my mother . . . " Paul grated. He glared at Scarface.
    "Hey!" the pilot laughed. "Cub's got a bark. Ain't got no bite, though."
    And Jessica thought; Paul's pitching his voice too high. It may work, though.
    They flew on in silence.
    These poor fools, Jessica thought, studying her guards and reviewing the Baron's words. They'll be killed as soon as they report success on their mission. The Baron wants no witnesses.
    The 'thopter banked over the southern rim of the Shield Wall, and Jessica saw a moonshadowed expanse of sand beneath them.
    "This oughta be far enough," the pilot said. "The traitor said to put'em on the sand anywhere near the Shield Wall." He dipped the craft toward the dunes in a long, falling stoop, brought it up stiffly over the desert surface.
    Jessica saw Paul begin taking the rhythmic breaths of the calming exercise. He closed his eyes, opened them. Jessica stared, helpless to aid him. He hasn't mastered the Voice yet, she thought, if he fails . . . 
    The 'thopter touched sand with a soft lurch, and Jessica, looking north back across the Shield Wall, saw a shadow of wings settle out of sight up there.
    Someone's following us! she thought. Who? Then: The ones the Baron set to watch this pair. And there'll be watchers for the watchers, too.
    Czigo shut off his wing rotors. Silence flooded in upon them.
    Jessica turned her head. She could see out the window beyond Scarface a dim glow of light from a rising moon, a frosted rim of rock rising from the desert. Sandblast ridges streaked its sides.
    Paul cleared his throat.
    The pilot said: "Now, Kinet?" 
    "I dunno, Czigo."
    Czigo turned, said: "Ah-h-h, look." He reached out for Jessica's skirt.
    "Remove her gag," Paul commanded.
    Jessica felt the words rolling in the air. The tone, the timbre excellent--imperative, very sharp. A slightly lower pitch would have been better, but it could still fall within this man's spectrum.
    Czigo shifted his hand up to the band around Jessica's mouth, slipped the knot on the gag. 
    "Stop that!" Kinet ordered.
    "Ah, shut your trap," Czigo said. "Her hands're tied." He freed the knot and the binding dropped. His eyes glittered as he studied Jessica.
    Kinet put a hand on the pilot's arm. "Look, Czigo, no need to . . . "
    Jessica twisted her neck, spat out the gag. She pitched her voice in low, intimate tones. "Gentlemen! No need to fight over me." At the same time, she writhed sinuously for Kinet's benefit.
    She saw them grow tense, knowing that in this instant they were convinced of the need to fight over her. Their disagreement required no other reason. In their minds, they were fighting over her.
    She held her face high in the instrument glow to be sure Kinet would read her lips, said: "You mustn't disagree." They drew farther apart, glanced warily at each other. "Is any woman worth fighting over?" she asked.
    By uttering the words, by being there, she made herself infinitely worth their fighting.
    Paul clamped his lips tightly closed, forced himself to be silent. There had been the one chance for him to succeed with the Voice. Now--everything depended on his mother whose experience went so far beyond his own.
    "Yeah," Scarface said. "No need to fight over . . . " 
    His hand flashed toward the pilot's neck. The blow was met by a splash of metal that caught the arm and in the same motion slammed into Kinet's chest.
    Scarface groaned, sagged backward against his door.
    "Thought I was some dummy didn't know that trick," Czigo said. He brought back his hand, revealing the knife. It glittered in reflected moonlight.
    "Now for the cub," he said and leaned toward Paul. 
    "No need for that," Jessica murmured. 
    Czigo hesitated.
    "Wouldn't you rather have me cooperative?" Jessica asked. "Give the boy a chance." Her lip curled in a sneer. "Little enough chance he'd have out there in that sand. Give him that and . . . " She smiled. "You could find yourself well rewarded." 
    Czigo glanced left, right, returned his attention to Jessica. "I've heard me what can happen to a man in this desert," he said. "Boy might find the knife a kindness."
    "Is it so much I ask?" Jessica pleaded. 
    "You're trying to trick me," Czigo muttered.
    "I don't want to see my son die," Jessica said. "Is that a trick?" 
    Czigo moved back, elbowed the door latch. He grabbed Paul, dragged him across the seat, pushed him half out the door and held the knife posed. "What'll y' do, cub, if I cut y'r bonds?" 
    "He'll leave here immediately and head for those rocks," Jessica said.
    "Is that what y'll do, cub?" Czigo asked. 
    Paul's voice was properly surly. "Yes."
    The knife moved down, slashed the bindings of his legs. Paul felt the hand on his back to hurl him down onto the sand, feigned a lurch against the doorframe for purchase, turned as though to catch himself, lashed out with his right foot.
    The toe was aimed with a precision that did credit to his long years of training, as though all of that training focused on this instant. Almost every muscle of his body cooperated in the placement of it. The tip struck the soft part of Czigo's abdomen just below the sternum, slammed upward with terrible force over the liver and through the diaphragm to crush the right ventricle of the man's heart.
    With one gurgling scream, the guard jerked backward across the seats. Paul, unable to use his hands, continued his tumble onto the sand, landing with a roll that took up the force and brought him back to his feet in one motion. He dove back into the cabin, found the knife and held it in his teeth while his mother sawed her bonds. She took the blade and freed his hands.
    "I could've handled him," she said. "He'd have had to cut my bindings. That was a foolish risk." 
    "I saw the opening and used it," he said.
    She heard the harsh control in his voice, said: "Yueh's house sign is scrawled on the ceiling of this cabin." 
    He looked up, saw the curling symbol.
    "Get out and let us study this craft," she said. "There's a bundle under the pilot's seat. I felt it when we got in." 
    "Bomb?" 
    "Doubt it. There's something peculiar here."
    Paul leaped out to the sand and Jessica followed. She turned, reached under the seat for the strange bundle, seeing Czigo's feet close to her face, feeling dampness on the bundle as she removed it, realizing the dampness was the pilot's blood.
    Waste of moisture, she thought, knowing that this was Arrakeen thinking.
    Paul stared around them, saw the rock scarp lifting out of the desert like a beach rising from the sea, wind-carved palisades beyond. He turned back as his mother lifted the bundle from the 'thopter, saw her stare across the dunes toward the Shield Wall. He looked to see what drew her attention, saw another 'thopter swooping toward them, realized they'd not have time to clear the bodies out of this 'thopter and escape.
    "Run, Paul!" Jessica shouted. "It's Harkonnens!"

-from "Collected Sayings of, Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    A man in Harkonnen uniform skidded to a stop at the end of the hall, stared in at Yueh, taking in at a single glance Mapes' body, the sprawled form of the Duke, Yueh standing there. The man held a lasgun in his right hand. There was a casual air of brutality about him, a sense of toughness and poise that sent a shiver through Yueh.
    Sardaukar, Yueh thought. A Bashar by the look of him. Probably one of the Emperor's own sent here to keep an eye on things. No matter what the uniform, there's no disguising them.
    "You're Yueh," the man said. He looked speculatively at the Suk School ring on the Doctor's hair, stared once at the diamond tattoo and then met Yueh's eyes. 
    "I am Yueh," the Doctor said.
    "You can relax, Yueh," the man said. "When you dropped the house shields we came right in. Everything's under control here. Is this the Duke?" 
    "This is the Duke." 
    "Dead?" 
    "Merely unconscious. I suggest you tie him."
    "Did you do for these others?" He glanced back down the hall where Mapes' body lay.
    "More's the pity," Yueh muttered.
    "Pity!" the Sardaukar sneered. He advanced, looked down at Leto. "So that's the great Red Duke."
    If I had doubts about what this man is, that would end them, Yueh thought. Only the Emperor calls the Atreides the Red Duke.
    The Sardaukar reached down, cut the red hawk insignia from Leto's uniform. "Little souvenir," he said. "Where's the ducal signet ring?" 
    "He doesn't have it on him," Yueh said. 
    "I can see that!" the Sardaukar snapped.
    Yueh stiffened, swallowed, if they press me, bring in a Truthsayer, they'll find out about the ring, about the 'thopter I prepared--all will fail.
    "Sometimes the Duke sent the ring with a messenger as surety that an order came directly from him," Yueh said. 
    "Must be damned trusted messengers," the Sardaukar muttered. 
    "Aren't you going to tie him?" Yueh ventured. 
    "How long'll he be unconscious?"
    "Two hours or so. I wasn't as precise with his dosage as I was for the woman and boy."
    The Sardaukar spurned the Duke with his toe. "This was nothing to fear even when awake. When will the woman and boy awaken?" 
    "About ten minutes." 
    "So soon?"
    "I was told the Baron would arrive immediately behind his men."
    "So he will. You'll wait outside, Yueh." He shot a hard glance at Yueh. "Now!" 
    Yueh glanced at Leto. "What about . . . "
    "He'll be delivered to the Baron all properly trussed like a roast for the oven." Again, the Sardaukar looked at the diamond tattoo on Yueh's forehead. "You're known; you'll be safe enough in the halls. We've no more time for chit-chat, traitor. I hear the others coming."
    Traitor, Yueh thought. He lowered his gaze, pressed past the Sardaukar, knowing this as a foretaste of how history would remember him: Yueh the traitor.
    He passed more bodies on his way to the front entrance and glanced at them, fearful that one might be Paul or Jessica. All were house troopers or wore Harkonnen uniform.
    Harkonnen guards came alert, staring at him as he emerged from the front entrance into flame-lighted night. The palms along the road had been fired to illuminate the house. Black smoke from the flammables used to ignite the trees poured upward through orange flames.
    "It's the traitor," someone said.
    "The Baron will want to see you soon," another said.
    I must get to the 'thopter, Yueh thought. I must put the ducal signet where Paul will find it. And fear struck him: If Idaho suspects me or grows impatient--if he doesn't wait and go exactly where I told him--Jessica and Paul will not be saved from the carnage. I'll be denied even the smallest relief from my act.
    The Harkonnen guard released his arm, said "Wait over there out of the way."
    Abruptly, Yueh saw himself as cast away in this place of destruction, spared nothing, given not the smallest pity. Idaho must not fail!
    Another guard bumped into him, barked: "Stay out of the way, you!"
    Even when they've profited by me they despise me. Yueh thought. He straightened himself as he was pushed aside, regained some of his dignity.
    "Wait for the Baron!" a guard officer snarled.
    Yueh nodded, walked with controlled casualness along the front of the house, turned the corner into shadows out of sight of the burning palms. Quickly, every step betraying his anxiety, Yueh made for the rear yard beneath the conservatory where the 'thopter waited--the craft they had placed there to carry away Paul and his mother.
    A guard stood at the open rear door of the house, his attention focused on the lighted hall and men banging through there, searching from room to room. 
    How confident they were!
    Yueh hugged the shadows, worked his way around the 'thopter, eased open the door on the side away from the guard. He felt under the front seats for the Fremkit he had hidden there, lifted a flap and slipped in the ducal signet. He felt the crinkling of the spice paper there, the note he had written, pressed the ring into the paper. He removed his hand, resealed the pack.
    Softly, Yueh closed the 'thopter door, worked his way back to the corner of the house and around toward the flaming trees. 
    Now, it is done, he thought.
    Once more, he emerged into the light of the blazing palms. He pulled his cloak around him, stared at the flames. Soon I will know. Soon I will see the Baron and I will know. And the Baron--he will encounter a small tooth.

There is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked across the skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan.
-the Princess Irulan: "Introduction to A Child's History of Muad'Dib"

    The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood at a viewport of the grounded lighter he was using as a command post. Out the port he saw the flame-lighted night of Arrakeen. His attention focused on the distant Shield Wall where his secret weapon was doing its work. 
    Explosive artillery.
    The guns nibbled at the caves where the Duke's fighting men had retreated for a last-ditch stand. Slowly measured bites of orange glare, showers of rock and dust in the brief illumination--and the Duke's men were being sealed off to die by starvation, caught like animals in their burrows.
    The Baron could feel the distant chomping--a drumbeat carried to him through the ship's metal: broomp . . . broomp. Then: BROOMP-broomp!
    Who would think of reviving artillery in this day of shields? The thought was a chuckle in his mind. But it was predictable the Duke's men would run for those caves. And the Emperor will appreciate my cleverness in preserving the lives of our mutual force.
    He adjusted one of the little suspensors that guarded his fat body against the pull of gravity. A smile creased his mouth, pulled at the lines of his jowls.
    A pity to waste such fighting men as the Duke's, he thought. He smiled more broadly, laughing at himself. Pity should be cruel! He nodded. Failure was, by definition, expendable. The whole universe sat there, open to the man who could make the right decisions. The uncertain rabbits had to be exposed, made to run for their burrows. Else how could you control them and breed them? He pictured his fighting men as bees routing the rabbits. And he thought: The day hums sweetly when you have enough bees working for you.
    A door opened behind him. The Baron studied the reflection in the night-blackened viewport before turning.
    Piter de Vries advanced into the chamber followed by Umman Kudu, the captain of the Baron's personal guard. There was a motion of men just outside the door, the mutton faces of his guard, their expressions carefully sheep-like in his presence.
    The Baron turned.
    Piter touched finger to forelock in his mocking salute. "Good news, m'Lord. The Sardaukar have brought in the Duke." 
    "Of course they have," the Baron rumbled.
    He studied the somber mask of villainy on Piter's effeminate face. And the eyes: those shaded slits of bluest blue-in-blue.
    Soon I mast remove him, the Baron thought. He has almost outlasted his usefulness, almost reached the point of positive danger to my person. First, though, he must make the people of Arrakis hate him. Then--they will welcome my darling Feyd-Rautha as a savior.
    The Baron shifted his attention to the guard captain--Umman Kudu: scissors-line of jaw muscles, chin like a boot toe--a man to be trusted because the captain's vices were known.
    "First, where is the traitor who gave me the Duke?" the Baron asked. "I must give the traitor his reward." 
    Piter turned on one toe, motioned to the guard outside.
    A bit of black movement there and Yueh walked through. His motions were stiff and stringy. The mustache drooped beside his purple lips. Only the old eyes seemed alive. Yueh came to a stop three paces into the room, obeying a motion from Piter, and stood there staring across the open space at the Baron. 
    "Ah-h-h, Dr. Yueh." 
    "M'Lord Harkonnen." 
    "You've given us the Duke, I hear." 
    "My half of the bargain, m'Lord." 
    The Baron looked at Piter. 
    Piter nodded.
    The Baron looked back at Yueh. "The letter of the bargain, eh? And I . . ." He spat the words out: "What was I to do in return?" 
    "You remember quite well, m'Lord Harkonnen." 
    And Yueh allowed himself to think now, hearing the loud silence of clocks in his mind. He had seen the subtle betrayals in the Baron's manner. Wanna was indeed dead--gone far beyond their reach. Otherwise, there'd still be a hold on the weak doctor. The Baron's manner showed there was no hold; it was ended. 
    "Do I?" the Baron asked. 
    "You promised to deliver my Wanna from her agony." 
    The Baron nodded. "Oh, yes. Now, I remember. So I did. That was my promise. That was how we bent the Imperial Conditioning. You couldn't endure seeing your Bene Gesserit witch grovel in Piter's pain amplifiers. Well, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen always keeps his promises. I told you I'd free her from the agony and permit you to join her. So be it." He waved a hand at Piter.
    Piter's blue eyes took a glazed look. His movement was catlike in its sudden fluidity. The knife in his hand glistened like a claw as it flashed into Yueh's back.
    The old man stiffened, never taking his attention from the Baron. 
    "So join her!" the Baron spat.
    Yueh stood, swaying, His lips moved with careful precision, and his voice came in oddly measured cadence: "You . . . think . . . you . . . de . . . feated . . . me. You . . . think . . . I . . . did . . . not . . . know . . . what . . . I . . . bought . . . for . . . my . . . Wanna." 
    He toppled. No bending or softening. It was like a tree falling. 
    "So join her," the Baron repeated. But his words were like a weak echo.
    Yueh had filled him with a sense of foreboding. He whipped his attention to Piter, watched the man wipe the blade on a scrap of cloth, watched the creamy look of satisfaction in the blue eyes.
    So that's how he kills by his own hand, the Baron thought. It's well to know.
    "He did give us the Duke?" the Baron asked. 
    "Of a certainty, my Lord," Piter said. 
    "Then get him in here!" 
    Piter glanced at the guard captain, who whirled to obey.
    The Baron looked down at Yueh. From the way the man had fallen, you could suspect oak in him instead of bones.
    "I never could bring myself to trust a traitor," the Baron said. "Not even a traitor I created."
    He glanced at the night-shrouded viewport. That black bag of stillness out there was his, the Baron knew. There was no more crump of artillery against the Shield Wall caves; the burrow traps were sealed off. Quite suddenly, the Baron's mind could conceive of nothing more beautiful than that utter emptiness of black. Unless it were white on the black. Plated white on the black. Porcelain white.
    But there was still the feeling of doubt.
    What had the old fool of a doctor meant? Of course, he'd probably known what would happen to him in the end. But that bit about thinking he'd been defeated: "You think you defeated me." 
    What had he meant?
    The Duke Leto Atreides came through the door. His arms were bound in chains, the eagle face streaked with dirt. His uniform was torn where someone had ripped off his insignia. There were tatters at his waist where the shield belt had been removed without first freeing the uniform ties. The Duke's eyes held a glazed, insane look.
    "Wel-l-l-l," the Baron said. He hesitated, drawing in a deep breath. He knew he had spoken too loudly. This moment, long envisioned, had lost some of its savor. 
    Damn that cursed doctor through all eternity!
    "I believe the good Duke is drugged," Piter said. "That's how Yueh caught him for us." Piter turned to the Duke. "Aren't you drugged, my dear Duke?"
    The voice was far away. Leto could feel the chains, the ache of muscles, his cracked lips, his burning cheeks, the dry taste of thirst whispering its grit in his mouth. But sounds were dull, hidden by a cottony blanket. And he saw only dim shapes through the blanket.
    "What of the woman and the boy, Piter?" the Baron asked. "Any word yet?" 
    Piter's tongue darted over his lips.
    "You've heard something!" the Baron snapped. "What?" 
    Piter glanced at the guard captain, back to the Baron. "The men who were sent to do the job, m'Lord--they've . . . ah . . . been . . . ah . . . found." 
    "Well, they report everything satisfactory?" 
    "They're dead, m'Lord." 
    "Of course they are! What I want to know is--" 
    "They were dead when found, m'Lord." 
    The Baron's face went livid. "And the woman and boy?" 
    "No sign, m'Lord, but there was a worm. It came while the scene was being investigated. Perhaps it's as we wished--an accident. Possibly--"
    "We do not deal in possibilities, Piter. What of the missing 'thopter? Does that suggest anything to my Mentat?" 
    "One of the Duke's men obviously escaped in it, m'Lord. Killed our pilot and escaped." 
    "Which of the Duke's men?"
    "It was a clean, silent killing, m'Lord. Hawat, perhaps, or that Halleck one. Possibly Idaho. Or any top lieutenant." 
    "Possibilities," the Baron muttered. He glanced at the swaying, drugged figure of the Duke.
    "The situation is in hand, m'Lord," Piter said.
    "No, it isn't! Where is that stupid planetologist? Where is this man Kynes?"
    "We've word where to find him and he's been sent for, m'Lord."
    "I don't like the way the Emperor's servant is helping us," the Baron muttered.
    They were words through a cottony blanket, but some of them burned in Leto's mind. Woman and boy--no sign. Paul and Jessica had escaped. And the fate of Hawat, Halleck, and Idaho remained an unknown. There was still hope.
    "Where is the ducal signet ring?" the Baron demanded. "His finger is bare."
    "The Sardaukar say it was not on him when he was taken, my Lord," the guard captain said.
    "You killed the doctor too soon," the Baron said. "That was a mistake. You should've warned me, Piter. You moved too precipitately for the good of our enterprise." He scowled. "Possibilities!"
    The thought hung like a sine wave in Leto's mind: Paul and Jessica have escaped! And there was something else in his memory: a bargain. He could almost remember it. 
    The tooth!
    He remembered part of it now: a pill of poison gas shaped into a false tooth.
    Someone had told him to remember the tooth. The tooth was in his mouth. He could feel its shape with his tongue. All he had to do was bite sharply on it. 
    Not yet!
    The someone had told him to wait until he was near the Baron. Who had told him? He couldn't remember.
    "How long will he remain drugged like this?" the Baron asked. 
    "Perhaps another hour, m'Lord."
    "Perhaps," the Baron muttered. Again, he turned to the night-blackened window. "I am hungry."
    That's the Baron, that fuzzy gray shape there, Leto thought. The shape danced back and forth, swaying with the movement of the room. And the room expanded and contracted. It grew brighter and darker. It folded into blackness and faded.
    Time became a sequence of layers for the Duke. He drifted up through them. I must wait.
    There was a table. Leto saw the table quite clearly. And a gross, fat man on the other side of the table, the remains of a meal in front of him. Leto felt himself sitting in a chair across from the fat man, felt the chains, the straps that held his tingling body in the chair. He was aware there had been a passage of time, but its length escaped him.
    "I believe he's coming around. Baron." 
    A silky voice, that one. That was Piter. 
    "So I see, Piter." 
    A rumbling basso: the Baron.
    Leto sensed increasing definition in his surroundings. The chair beneath him took on firmness, the bindings were sharper.
    And he saw the Baron clearly now. Leto watched the movements of the man's hands: compulsive touchings--the edge of a plate, the handle of a spoon, a finger tracing the fold of a jowl. 
    Leto watched the moving hand, fascinated by it.
    "You can hear me, Duke Leto," the Baron said. "I know you can hear me. We want to know from you where to find your concubine and the child you sired on her."
    No sign escaped Leto, but the words were a wash of calmness through him. It's true, then: they don't have Paul and Jessica.
    "This is not a child's game we play," the Baron rumbled. "You must know that." He leaned toward Leto, studying the face. It pained the Baron that this could not be handled privately, just between the two of them. To have others see royalty in such straits--it set a bad precedent.
    Leto could feel strength returning. And now, the memory of the false tooth stood out in his mind like a steeple in a flat landscape. The nerve-shaped capsule within that tooth--the poison gas--he remembered who had put the deadly weapon in his mouth. 
    Yueh.
    Drug-fogged memory of seeing a limp corpse dragged past him in this room hung like a vapor in Leto's mind. He knew it had been Yueh.
    "Do you hear that noise, Duke Leto?" the Baron asked.
    Leto grew conscious of a frog sound, the burred mewling of someone's agony.
    "We caught one of your men disguised as a Fremen, " the Baron said. "We penetrated the disguise quite easily: the eyes, you know. He insists he was sent among the Fremen to spy on them. I've lived for a time on this planet, cher cousin. One does not spy on those ragged scum of the desert. Tell me, did you buy their help? Did you send your woman and son to them?"
    Leto felt fear tighten his chest. If Yueh sent them to the desert fold . . . the search won't stop until they 're found.
    "Come, come," the Baron said. "We don't have much time and pain is quick. Please don't bring it to this, my dear Duke." The Baron looked up at Piter who stood at Leto's shoulder. "Piter doesn't have all his tools here, but I'm sure he could improvise."
    "Improvisation is sometimes the best, Baron." 
    That silky, insinuating voice! Leto heard it at his ear.
    "You had an emergency plan," the Baron said. "Where have your woman and the boy been sent?" He looked at Leto's hand. "Your ring is missing. Does the boy have it?" 
    The Baron looked up, stared into Leto's eyes.
    "You don't answer," he said. "Will you force me to do a thing I do not want to do? Piter will use simple, direct methods. I agree they're sometimes the best, but it's not good that you should be subjected to such things."
    "Hot tallow on the back, perhaps, or on the eyelids," Piter said. "Perhaps on other portions of the body. It's especially effective when the subject doesn't know where the tallow will fall next. It's a good method and there's a sort of beauty in the pattern of pus-white blisters on naked skin, eh,  Baron?" 
    "Exquisite," the Baron said, and his voice sounded sour.
    Those touching fingers! Leto watched the fat hands, the glittering jewels on baby-fat hands--their compulsive wandering.
    The sounds of agony coming through the door behind him gnawed at the Duke's nerves. Who is it they caught? he wondered. Could it have been Idaho?
    "Believe me, cher cousin," the Baron said. "I do not want it to come to this."
    "You think of nerve couriers racing to summon help that cannot come," Piter said. "There's an artistry in this, you know." 
    "You're a superb artist," the Baron growled. "Now, have the decency to be silent."
    Leto suddenly recalled a thing Gurney Halleck had said once, seeing a picture of the Baron: " 'And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea . . . and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.' "
    "We waste time, Baron," Piter said. 
    "Perhaps."
    The Baron nodded. "You know, my dear Leto, you'll tell us in the end where they are. There's a level of pain that'll buy you." 
    He's most likely correct, Leto thought. Were if not for the tooth . . . and the fact that I truly don't know where they are.
    The Baron picked up a sliver of meat, pressed the morsel into his mouth, chewed slowly, swallowed. We must try a new tack, he thought.
    "Observe this prize person who denies he's for hire," the Baron said. "Observe him, Piter."
    And the Baron thought: Yes! See him there, this man who believes he cannot be bought. See him detained there by a million shares of himself sold in dribbles every second of his life! If you took him up now and shook him, he'd rattle inside. Emptied! Sold out! What difference how he dies now?
    The frog sounds in the background stopped.
    The Baron saw Umman Kudu, the guard captain, appear in the doorway across the room, shake his head. The captive hadn't produced the needed information. Another failure. Time to quit stalling with this fool Duke, this stupid soft fool who didn't realize how much hell there was so near him--only a nerve's thickness away.
    This thought calmed the Baron, overcoming his reluctance to have a royal person subject to pain. He saw himself suddenly as a surgeon exercising endless supple scissor dissections--cutting away the masks from fools, exposing the hell beneath. 
    Rabbits, all of them!
    And how they cowered when they saw the carnivore!
    Leto stared across the table, wondering why he waited. The tooth would end it all quickly. Still--it had been good, much of this life. He found himself remembering an antenna kite updangling in the shell-blue sky of Caladan, and Paul laughing with joy at the sight of it. And he remembered sunrise here on Arrakis--colored strata of the Shield Wall mellowed by dust haze.
    "Too bad," the Baron muttered. He pushed himself back from the table, stood up lightly in his suspensors and hesitated, seeing a change come over the Duke. He saw the man draw in a deep breath, the jawline stiffen, the ripple of a muscle there as the Duke clamped his mouth shut.
    How he fears me! the Baron thought.
    Shocked by fear that the Baron might escape him, Leto bit sharply on the capsule tooth, felt it break. He opened his mouth, expelled the biting vapor he could taste as it formed on his tongue. The Baron grew smaller, a figure seen in a tightening tunnel. Leto heard a gasp beside his ear--the silky-voiced one: Piter. 
    It got him, too!
    "Piter! What's wrong?" 
    The rumbling voice was far away.
    Leto sensed memories rolling in his mind--the old toothless mutterings of hags. The room, the table, the Baron, a pair of terrified eyes--blue within blue, the eyes--all compressed around him in ruined symmetry.
    There was a man with a boot-toe chin, a toy man falling. The toy man had a broken nose slanted to the left: an offbeat metronome caught forever at the start of an upward stroke. Leto heard the crash of crockery--so distant--a roaring in his ears. His mind was a bin without end, catching everything. Everything that had ever been: every shout, every whisper, every . . . silence.
    One thought remained to him. Leto saw it in formless light on rays of black: The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes. The thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain. 
    Silence.
    The Baron stood with his back against his private door, his own bolt hole behind the table. He had slammed it on a room full of dead men. His senses took in guards swarming around him. Did I breathe it? he asked himself. Whatever it was in there, did it get me, too?
    Sounds returned to him . . . and reason. He heard someone shouting orders--gas masks . . . keep a door closed . . . get blowers going.
    The others fell quickly, he thought. I'm still standing. I'm still breathing. Merciless hell! That was close!
    He could analyze it now. His shield had been activated, set low but still enough to slow molecular interchange across the field barrier. And he had been pushing himself away from the table . . . that and Piter's shocked gasp which had brought the guard captain darting forward into his own doom.
    Chance and the warning in a dying man's gasp--these had saved him.
    The Baron felt no gratitude to Piter. The fool had got himself killed. And that stupid guard captain! He'd said he scoped everyone before bringing them into the Baron's presence! How had it been possible for the Duke . . . ? No warning. Not even from the poison snooper over the table--until it was too late. How?
    Well, no matter now, the Baron thought, his mind firming. The next guard captain will begin by finding answers to these questions.
    He grew aware of more activity down the hall--around the corner at the other door to that room of death. The Baron pushed himself away from his own door, studied the lackeys around him. They stood there staring, silent, waiting for the Baron's reaction. 
    Would the Baron be angry?
    And the Baron realized only a few seconds had passed since his flight from that terrible room.
    Some of the guards had weapons leveled at the door. Some were directing their ferocity toward the empty hall that stretched away toward the noises around the corner to their right.
    A man came striding around that corner, gas mask dangling by its straps at his neck, his eyes intent on the overhead poison snoopers that lined this corridor. He was yellow-haired, flat of face with green eyes. Crisp lines radiated from his thick-lipped mouth. He looked like some water creature misplaced among those who walked the land.
    The Baron stared at the approaching man, recalling the name: Nefud. Iakin Nefud. Guard corporal. Nefud was addicted to semuta, the drug-music combination that played itself in the deepest consciousness. A useful item of information, that.
    The man stopped in front of the Baron, saluted. "Corridor's clear, m'Lord. I was outside watching and saw that it must be poison gas. Ventilators in your room were pulling air in from these corridors." He glanced up at the snooper over the Baron's head. "None of the stuff escaped. We have the room cleaned out now. What are your orders?"
    The Baron recognized the man's voice--the one who'd been shouting orders. Efficient, this corporal, he thought. 
    "They're all dead in there?" the Baron asked. 
    "Yes, m'Lord." 
    Well, we must adjust, the Baron thought.
    "First," he said, "let me congratulate you, Nefud. You're the new captain of my guard. And I hope you'll take to heart the lesson to be learned from the fate of your predecessor."
    The Baron watched the awareness grow in his newly promoted guardsman. Nefud knew he'd never again be without his semuta.
    Nefud nodded. "My Lord knows I'll devote myself entirely to his safety."
    "Yes. Well, to business. I suspect the Duke had something in his mouth. You will find out what that something was, how it was used, who helped him put it there. You'll take every precaution--" 
    He broke off, his chain of thought shattered by a disturbance in the corridor behind him--guards at the door to the lift from the lower levels of the frigate trying to hold back a tall colonel bashar who had just emerged from the lift.
    The Baron couldn't place the colonel bashar's face: thin with mouth like a slash in leather, twin ink spots for eyes.
    "Get your hands off me, you pack of carrion-eaters!" the man roared, and he dashed the guards aside. 
    Ah-h-h, one of the Sardaukar, the Baron thought.
    The colonel bashar came striding toward the Baron, whose eyes went to slits of apprehension. The Sardaukar officers filled him with unease. They all seemed to look like relatives of the Duke . . . the late Duke. And their manners with the Baron!
    The colonel bashar planted himself half a pace in front of the Baron, hands on hips. The guard hovered behind him in twitching uncertainty.
    The Baron noted the absence of salute, the disdain in the Sardaukar's manner, and his unease grew. There was only the one legion of them locally--ten brigades--reinforcing the Harkonnen legions, but the Baron did not fool himself. That one legion was perfectly capable of turning on the Harkonnens and overcoming them.
    "Tell your men they are not to prevent me from seeing you, Baron," the Sardaukar growled. "My men brought you the Atreides Duke before I could discuss his fate with you. We will discuss it now." 
    I must not lose face before my men, the Baron thought.
    "So?" It was a coldly controlled word, and the Baron felt proud of it.
    "My Emperor has charged me to make certain his royal cousin dies cleanly without agony," the colonel bashar said.
    "Such were the Imperial orders to me," the Baron lied. "Did you think I'd disobey?"
    "I'm to report to my Emperor what I see with my own eyes," the Sardaukar said.
    "The Duke's already dead," the Baron snapped, and he waved a hand to dismiss the fellow.
    The colonel bashar remained planted facing the Baron. Not by flicker of eye or muscle did he acknowledge he had been dismissed. "How?" he growled.
    Really! the Baron thought. This is too much.
    "By his own hand, if you must know," the Baron said. "He took poison." 
    "I will see the body now," the colonel Bashar said.
    The Baron raised his gaze to the ceiling in feigned exasperation while his thoughts raced. Damnation! This sharp-eyed Sardaukar will see the room before a thing's been changed! 
    "Now," the Sardaukar growled. "I'll see it with my own eyes." 
    There was no preventing it, the Baron realized. The Sardaukar would see all. He'd know the Duke had killed Harkonnen men . . . that the Baron most likely had escaped by a narrow margin. There was the evidence of the dinner remnants on the table, and the dead Duke across from it with destruction around him. 
    No preventing it at all.
    "I'll not be put off," the colonel bashar snarled. 
    "You're not being put off," the Baron said, and he stared into the Sardaukar's obsidian eyes. "I hide nothing from my Emperor." He nodded to Nefud. "The colonel bashar is to see everything, at once. Take him in by the door where you stood, Nefud." 
    "This way, sir," Nefud said.
    Slowly, insolently, the Sardaukar moved around the Baron, shouldered a way through the guardsmen.
    Insufferable, the Baron thought. Now, the Emperor will know how I slipped up. He'll recognize it as a sign of weakness.
    And it was agonizing to realize that the Emperor and his Sardaukar were alike in their disdain for weakness. The Baron chewed at his lower lip, consoling himself that the Emperor, at least, had not learned of the Atreides raid on Giedi Prime, the destruction of the Harkonnen spice stores there. 
    Damn that slippery Duke!
    The Baron watched the retreating backs--the arrogant Sardaukar and the stocky, efficient Nefud.
    We must adjust, the Baron thought. I'll have to put Rabban over this damnable planet once more. Without restraint. I must spend my own Harkonnen blood to put Arrakis into a proper condition for accepting Feyd-Rautha. Damn that Piter! He would get himself killed before I was through with him.
    The Baron sighed.
    And I must send at once to Tleielax for a new Mentat. They undoubtedly have the new one ready for me by now. 
    One of the guardsmen beside him coughed. 
    The Baron turned toward the man. "I am hungry." 
    "Yes, m'Lord."
    "And I wish to be diverted while you're clearing out that room and studying its secrets for me," the Baron rumbled.
    The guardsman lowered his eyes. "What diversion does m'Lord wish?"
    "I'll be in my sleeping chambers," the Baron said. "Bring me that young fellow we bought on Gamont, the one with the lovely eyes. Drug him well. I don't feel like wrestling." 
    "Yes, m'Lord."
    The Baron turned away, began moving with his bouncing, suspensor-buoyed pace toward his chambers. Yes, he thought. The one with the lovely eyes, the one who looks so much like the young Paul Atreides.

O Seas of Caladan, 
O people of Duke Leto-- 
Citadel of Leto fallen, 
Fallen forever . . .
-from "Songs of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    Paul felt that all his past, every experience before this night, had become sand curling in an hourglass. He sat near his mother hugging his knees within a small fabric and plastic hutment--a stilltent--that had come, like the Fremen clothing they now wore, from the pack left in the 'thopter.
    There was no doubt in Paul's mind who had put the Fremkit there, who had directed the course of the 'thopter carrying them captive. 
    Yueh.
    The traitor doctor had sent them directly into the hands of Duncan Idaho.
    Paul stared out the transparent end of the stilltent at the moonshadowed rocks that ringed this place where Idaho had hidden them.
    Hiding like a child when I'm now the Duke, Paul thought. He felt the thought gall him, but could not deny the wisdom in what they did.
    Something had happened to his awareness this night--he saw with sharpened clarity every circumstance and occurrence around him. He felt unable to stop the inflow of data or the cold precision with which each new item was added to his knowledge and the computation was centered in his awareness. It was Mentat power and more.
    Paul thought back to the moment of impotent rage as the strange 'thopter dived out of the night onto them, stooping like a giant hawk above the desert with wind screaming through its wings. The thing in Paul's mind had happened then. The 'thopter had skidded and slewed across a sand ridge toward the running figures--his mother and himself. Paul remembered how the smell of burned sulfur from abrasion of 'thopter skids against sand had drifted across them.
    His mother, he knew, had turned, expected to meet a lasgun in the hands of Harkonnen mercenaries, and had recognized Duncan Idaho leaning out the 'thopter's open door shouting: "Hurry! There's wormsign south of you!"
    But Paul had known as he turned who piloted the 'thopter. An accumulation of minutiae in the way it was flown, the dash of the landing--clues so small even his mother hadn't detected them--had told Paul precisely who sat at those controls.
    Across the stilltent from Paul, Jessica stirred, said: "There can be only one explanation. The Harkonnens held Yueh's wife. He hated the Harkonnens! I cannot be wrong about that. You read his note. But why has he saved us from the carnage?" 
    She is only now seeing it and that poorly, Paul thought. The thought was a shock. He had known this fact as a by-the-way thing while reading the note that had accompanied the ducal signet in the pack.
    "Do not try to forgive me," Yueh had written. "I do not want your forgiveness. I already have enough burdens. What I have done was done without malice or hope of another's understanding. It is my own tahaddi al-burhan, my ultimate test. I give you the Atreides ducal signet as token that I write truly. By the time you read this, Duke Leto will be dead. Take consolation from my assurance that he did not die alone, that one we hate above all others died with him."
    It had not been addressed or signed, but there 'd been no mistaking the familiar scrawl--Yueh's.
    Remembering the letter, Paul re-experienced the distress of that moment--a thing sharp and strange that seemed to happen outside his new mentat alertness. He had read that his father was dead, known the truth of the words, but had felt them as no more than another datum to be entered in his mind and used.
    I loved my father, Paul thought, and knew this for truth. I should mourn him. I should feel something.
    But he felt nothing except: Here's an important fact. 
    It was one with all the other facts.
    All the while his mind was adding sense impressions, extrapolating, computing.
    Halleck's words came back to Paul: "Mood's a thing for cattle or for making love. You fight when the necessity arises, no matter your mood. "
    Perhaps that's it, Paul thought. I'll mourn my father later . . . when there's time.
    But he felt no letup in the cold precision of his being. He sensed that his new awareness was only a beginning, that it was growing. The sense of terrible purpose he'd first experienced in his ordeal with the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam pervaded him. His right hand--the hand of remembered pain--tingled and throbbed.
    Is this what it is to be their Kwisatz Haderach? he wondered.
    "For a while, I thought Hawat had failed us again, "Jessica said. "I thought perhaps Yueh wasn't a Suk doctor."
    "He was everything we thought him . . . and more," Paul said. And he thought: Why is she so slow seeing these things? He said, "If Idaho doesn't get through to Kynes, we'll be--" 
    "He's not our only hope," she said. 
    "Such was not my suggestion," he said.
    She heard the steel in his voice, the sense of command, and stared across the grey darkness of the stilltent at him. Paul was a silhouette against moon-frosted rocks seen through the tent's transparent end.
    "Others among your father's men will have escaped," she said. "We must regather them, find--"
    "We will depend upon ourselves," he said. "Our immediate concern is our family atomics. We must get them before the Harkonnens can search them out."
    "Not likely they'll be found," she said, "the way they were hidden." 
    "It must not be left to chance."
    And she thought: Blackmail with the family atomics as a threat to the planet and its spice--that's what he has in mind. But all he can hope for then is escape into renegade anonymity.
    His mother's words had provoked another train of thought in Paul--a duke's concern for all the people they'd lost this night. People are the true strength of a Great House, Paul thought. And he remembered Hawat's words: "Parting with people is a sadness; a place is only a place."
    "They're using Sardaukar," Jessica said. "We must wait until the Sardaukar have been withdrawn."
    "They think us caught between the desert and the Sardaukar," Paul said. "They intend that there be no Atreides survivors--total extermination. Do not count on any of our people escaping." 
    "They cannot go on indefinitely risking exposure of the Emperor's part in this." 
    "Can't they?" 
    "Some of our people are bound to escape." 
    "Are they?"
    Jessica turned away, frightened of the bitter strength in her son's voice, hearing the precise assessment of chances. She sensed that his mind had leaped ahead of her, that it now saw more in some respects than she did. She had helped train the intelligence which did this, but now she found herself fearful of it. Her thoughts turned, seeking toward the lost sanctuary of her Duke, and tears burned her eyes.
    This is the way it had to be, Leto, she thought. "A time of love and a time of grief." She rested her hand on her abdomen, awareness focused on the embryo there. I have the Atreides daughter I was ordered to produce, but the Reverend Mother was wrong: a daughter wouldn't have saved my Leto. This child is only life reaching for the future in the midst of death. I conceived out of instinct and not out of obedience.
    "Try the communinet receiver again," Paul said.
    The mind goes on working no matter how we try to hold it back, she thought.
    Jessica found the tiny receiver Idaho had left for them, flipped its switch. A green light glowed on the instrument's face. Tinny screeching came from its speaker. She reduced the volume, hunted across the bands. A voice speaking Atreides battle language came into the tent.
    " . . . back and regroup at the ridge. Fedor reports no survivors in Carthag and the Guild Bank has been sacked."
    Carthag! Jessica thought. That was a Harkonnen hotbed.
    "They're Sardaukar," the voice said. "Watch out for Sardaukar in Atreides uniforms. They're . . . " 
    A roaring filled the speaker, then silence. 
    "Try the other bands," Paul said.
    "Do you realize what that means?" Jessica asked.
    "I expected it. They want the Guild to blame us for destruction of their bank. With the Guild against us, we're trapped on Arrakis. Try the other bands."
    She weighed his words: I expected it. What had happened to him? Slowly, Jessica returned to the instrument. As she moved the bandslide, they caught glimpses of violence in the few voices calling out in Atreides battle language: " . . . fallback . . . " " . . . try to regroup at . . . " " . . . trapped in a cave at . . . ." 
    And there was no mistaking the victorious exultation in the Harkonnen gibberish that poured from the other bands. Sharp commands, battle reports. There wasn't enough of it for Jessica to register and break the language, but the tone was obvious. 
    Harkonnen victory.
    Paul shook the pack beside him, hearing the two literjons of water gurgle there. He took a deep breath, looked up through the transparent end of the tent at the rock escarpment outlined against the stars. His left hand felt the sphincter-seal of the tent's entrance. "It'll be dawn soon," he said. "We can wait through the day for Idaho, but not through another night. In the desert, you must travel by night and rest in shade through the day."
    Remembered lore insinuated itself into Jessica's mind: Without a stillsuit, a man sitting in shade on the desert needs five liters of water a day to maintain body weight. She felt the slick-soft skin of the stillsuit against her body, thinking how their lives depended on these garments.
    "If we leave here, Idaho can't find us," she said.
    "There are ways to make any man talk," he said. "If Idaho hasn't returned by dawn, we must consider the possibility he has been captured. How long do you think he could hold out?" 
    The question required no answer, and she sat in silence.
    Paul lifted the seal on the pack, pulled out a tiny micromanual with glowtab and magnifier. Green and orange letters leaped up at him from the pages: "literjons, stilltent, energy caps, recaths, sandsnork, binoculars, stillsuit repkit, baradye pistol, sinkchart, filt-plugs, paracompass, maker hooks, thumpers, Fremkit, fire pillar . . . " 
    So many things for survival on the desert. 
    Presently, he put the manual aside on the tent floor. 
    "Where can we possibly go?" Jessica asked.
    "My father spoke of desert power," Paul said. "The Harkonnens cannot rule this planet without it. They've never ruled this planet, nor shall they. Not even with ten thousand legions of Sardaukar." 
    "Paul, you can't think that--"
    "We've all the evidence in our hands," he said. "Right here in this tent--the tent itself, this pack and its contents, these stillsuits. We know the Guild wants a prohibitive price for weather satellites. We know that--"
    "What've weather satellites to do with it?" she asked. "They couldn't possibly . . . " She broke off.
    Paul sensed the hyperalertness of his mind reading her reactions, computing on minutiae. "You see it now," he said. "Satellites watch the terrain below. There are things in the deep desert that will not bear frequent inspection." 
    "You're suggesting the Guild itself controls this planet?" 
    She was so slow.
    "No!" he said. "The Fremen! They're paying the Guild for privacy, paying in a coin that's freely available to anyone with desert power--spice. This is more than a second-approximation answer; it's the straight-line computation. Depend on it."
    "Paul." Jessica said, "you're not a Mentat yet; you can't know for sure how--"
    "I'll never be a Mentat," he said. "I'm something else . . . a freak." 
    "Paul! How can you say such--" 
    "Leave me alone!"
    He turned away from her, looking out into the night. Why can't I mourn? he wondered. He felt that every fiber of his being craved this release, but it would be denied him forever.
    Jessica had never heard such distress in her son's voice. She wanted to reach out to him, hold him, comfort him, help him--but she sensed there was nothing she could do. He had to solve this problem by himself.
    The glowing tab of the Fremkit manual between them on the tent floor caught her eye. She lifted it, glanced at the flyleaf, reading: "Manual of 'The Friendly Desert,' the place full of life. Here are the ayat and burhan of Life. Believe, and al-Lat shall never burn you."
    It reads like the Azhar Book, she thought, recalling her studies of the Great Secrets. Has a Manipulator of Religions been on Arrakis?
    Paul lifted the paracompass from the pack, returned it, said: "Think of all these special-application Fremen machines. They show unrivaled sophistication. Admit it. The culture that made these things betrays depths no one suspected."
    Hesitating, still worried by the harshness in his voice, Jessica returned to the book, studied an illustrated constellation from the Arrakeen sky: "Muad'Dib: The Mouse," and noted that the tail pointed north.
    Paul stared into the tent's darkness at the dimly discerned movements of his mother revealed by the manual's glowtab. Now is the time to carry out my father's wish, he thought. I must give her his message now while she has time for grief. Grief would inconvenience us later. And he found himself shocked by precise logic. 
    "Mother," he said. 
    "Yes?"
    She heard the change in his voice, felt coldness in her entrails at the sound. Never had she heard such harsh control. 
    "My father is dead," he said.
    She searched within herself for the coupling of fact and fact and fact--the Bene Gesserit way of assessing data--and it came to her: the sensation of terrifying loss. 
    Jessica nodded, unable to speak.
    "My father charged me once," Paul said, "to give you a message if anything happened to him. He feared you might believe he distrusted you." 
    That useless suspicion, she thought.
    "He wanted you to know he never suspected you," Paul said, and explained the deception, adding: "He wanted you to know he always trusted you completely, always loved you and cherished you. He said he would sooner have mistrusted himself and he had but one regret--that he never made you his Duchess." 
    She brushed the tears coursing down her cheeks, thought: What a stupid waste of the body's water! But she knew this thought for what it was--the attempt to retreat from grief into anger. Leto, my Leto, she thought. What terrible things we do to those we love! With a violent motion, she extinguished the little manual's glowtab. 
    Sobs shook her.
    Paul heard his mother's grief and felt the emptiness within himself. I have no grief, he thought. Why? Why? He felt the inability to grieve as a terrible flaw.
    "A time to get and time to lose," Jessica thought, quoting to herself from the O.C. Bible. "A time to keep and a time to cast away; a time for love and a time to hate; a time of war and a time of peace. "
    Paul's mind had gone on in its chilling precision. He saw the avenues ahead of them on this hostile planet. Without even the safety valve of dreaming, he focused his prescient awareness, seeing it as a computation of most probable futures, but with something more, an edge of mystery--as though his mind dipped into some timeless stratum and sampled the winds of the future.
    Abruptly, as though he had found a necessary key, Paul's mind climbed another notch in awareness. He felt himself clinging to this new level, clutching at a precarious hold and peering about. It was as though he existed within a globe with avenues radiating away in all directions . . . yet this only approximated the sensation.
    He remembered once seeing a gauze kerchief blowing in the wind and now he sensed the future as though it twisted across some surface as undulant and impermanent as that of the windblown kerchief.
    He saw people.
    He felt the heat and cold of uncounted probabilities.
    He knew names and places, experienced emotions without number, reviewed data of innumerable unexplored crannies. There was time to probe and test and taste, but no time to shape.
    The thing was a spectrum of possibilities from the most remote past to the most remote future--from the most probable to the most improbable. He saw his own death in countless ways. He saw new planets, new cultures. 
    People. 
    People.
    He saw them in such swarms they could not be listed, yet his mind catalogued them.
    Even the Guildsmen.
    And he thought: The Guild--there' d be a way for us, my strangeness accepted as a familiar thing of high value, always with an assured supply of the now-necessary spice.
    But the idea of living out his life in the mind-groping-ahead-through-possible-futures that guided hurtling spaceships appalled him. It was a way, though. And in meeting the possible future that contained Guildsmen he recognized his own strangeness.
    I have another kind of sight. I see another kind of terrain: the available paths.
    The awareness conveyed both reassurance and alarm--so many places on that other kind of terrain dipped or turned out of his sight.
    As swiftly as it had come, the sensation slipped away from him, and he realized the entire experience had taken the space of a heartbeat.
    Yet, his own personal awareness had been turned over, illuminated in a terrifying way. He stared around him.
    Night still covered the stilltent within its rock-enclosed hideaway. His mother's grief could still be heard.
    His own lack of grief could still be felt . . . that hollow place somewhere separated from his mind, which went on in its steady pace--dealing with data, evaluating, computing, submitting answers in something like the Mentat way.
    And now he saw that he had a wealth of data few such minds ever before had encompassed. But this made the empty place within him no easier to bear. He felt that something must shatter. It was as though a clockwork control for a bomb had been set to ticking within him. It went on about its business no matter what he wanted. It recorded minuscule shadings of difference around him--a slight change in moisture, a fractional fall in temperature, the progress of an insect across their stilltent roof, the solemn approach of dawn in the starlighted patch of sky he could see out the tent's transparent end.
    The emptiness was unbearable. Knowing how the clockwork had been set in motion made no difference. He could look to his own past and see the start of it--the training, the sharpening of talents, the refined pressures of sophisticated disciplines, even exposure to the O.C. Bible at a critical moment . . . and, lastly, the heavy intake of spice. And he could look ahead--the most terrifying direction--to see where it all pointed. 
    I'm a monster! he thought. A freak! 
    "No," he said. Then: "No. No! NO!"
    He found that he was pounding the tent floor with his fists. (The implacable part of him recorded this as an interesting emotional datum and fed it into computation.) 
    "Paul!"
    His mother was beside him, holding his hands, her face a gray blob peering at him. "Paul, what's wrong?" 
    "You!" he said.
    "I'm here, Paul," she said. "It's all right." 
    "What have you done to me?" he demanded.
    In a burst of clarity, she sensed some of the roots in the question, said: "I gave birth to you."
    It was, from instinct as much as her own subtle knowledge, the precisely correct answer to calm him. He felt her hands holding him, focused on the dim outline of her face. (Certain gene traces in her facial structure were noted in the new way by his onflowing mind, the clues added to other data, and a final-summation answer put forward.) 
    "Let go of me," he said.
    She heard the iron in his voice, obeyed. "Do you want to tell me what's wrong, Paul?"
    "Did you know what you were doing when you trained me?" he asked.
    There's no more childhood in his voice, she thought. And she said: "I hoped the thing any parent hopes--that you'd be . . . superior, different." 
    "Different?" 
    She heard the bitterness in his tone, said: "Paul, I--" 
    "You didn't want a son!" he said. "You wanted a Kwisatz Haderach! You wanted a male Bene Gesserit!" 
    She recoiled from his bitterness. "But Paul . . ." 
    "Did you ever consult my father in this?"
    She spoke gently out of the freshness of her grief: "Whatever you are, Paul, the heredity is as much your father as me." 
    "But not the training," he said. "Not the things that . . . awakened . . . the sleeper." 
    "Sleeper?"
    "It's here." He put a hand to his head and then to his breast. "In me. It goes on and on and on and on and--"
    "Paul!" 
    She had heard the hysteria edging his voice.
    "Listen to me," he said. "You wanted the Reverend Mother to hear about my dreams: You listen in her place now. I've just had a waking dream. Do you know why?" 
    "You must calm yourself," she said. "If there's--" 
    "The spice," he said, "It's in everything here--the air, the soil, the food. The geriatric spice. It's like the Truthsayer drug. It's a poison!" 
    She stiffened.
    His voice lowered and he repeated: "A poison--so subtle, so insidious . . . so irreversible. It won't even kill you unless you stop taking it. We can't leave Arrakis unless we take part of Arrakis with us." 
    The terrifying presence of his voice brooked no dispute.
    "You and the spice," Paul said. "The spice changes anyone who gets this much of it, but thanks to you, I could bring the change to consciousness. I don't get to leave it in the unconscious where its disturbance can be blanked out. I can see it." 
    "Paul, you--" 
    "I see it!" he repeated.
    She heard madness in his voice, didn't know what to do.
    But he spoke again, and she heard the iron control return to him: "We're trapped here." 
    We're trapped here, she agreed.
    And she accepted the truth of his words. No pressure of the Bene Gesserit, no trickery or artifice could pry them completely free from Arrakis: the spice was addictive. Her body had known the fact long before her mind awakened to it.
    So here we live out our lives, she thought, on this hell-planet. The place is prepared for us, if we can evade the Harkonnens. And there's no doubt of my course: a broodmare preserving an important bloodline for the Bene Gesserit Plan.
    "I must tell you about my waking dream," Paul said. (Now there was fury in his voice.) "To be sure you accept what I say, I'll tell you first I know you'll bear a daughter, my sister, here on Arrakis." 
    Jessica placed her hands against the tent floor, pressed back against the curving fabric wall to still a pang of fear. She knew her pregnancy could not show yet. Only her own Bene Gesserit training had allowed her to read the first faint signals of her body, to know of the embryo only a few weeks old.
    "Only to serve," Jessica whispered, clinging to the Bene Gesserit motto. "We exist only to serve."
    "We'll find a home among the Fremen," Paul said, "where your Missionaria Protectiva has bought us a bolt hole." 
    They've prepared a way for us in the desert, Jessica told herself. But how can he know of the Missionaria Protectiva? She found it increasingly difficult to subdue her terror at the overpowering strangeness in Paul.
    He studied the dark shadow of her, seeing her fear and every reaction with his new awareness as though she were outlined in blinding light. A beginning of compassion for her crept over him.
    "The things that can happen here, I cannot begin to tell you," he said. "I cannot even begin to tell myself, although I've seen them. This sense of the future--I seem to have no control over it. The thing just happens. The immediate future--say, a year--I can see some of that . . . a road as broad as our Central Avenue on Caladan. Some places I don't see . . . shadowed places . . . as though it went behind a hill" (and again he thought of the surface of a blowing kerchief) " . . . and there are branchings . . . "
    He fell silent as memory of that seeing filled him. No prescient dream, no experience of his life had quite prepared him for the totality with which the veils had been ripped away to reveal naked time.
    Recalling the experience, he recognized his own terrible purpose--the pressure of his life spreading outward like an expanding bubble . . . time retreating before it . . . 
    Jessica found the tent's glowtab control, activated it.
    Dim green light drove back the shadows, easing her fear. She looked at Paul's face, his eyes--the inward stare. And she knew where she had seen such a look before: pictured in records of disasters--on the faces of children who experienced starvation or terrible injury. The eyes were like pits, mouth a straight line, cheeks indrawn.
    It's the look of terrible awareness, she thought, of someone forced to the knowledge of his own mortality. 
    He was, indeed, no longer a child.
    The underlying import of his words began to take over in her mind, pushing all else aside. Paul could see ahead, a way of escape for them.
    "There's a way to evade the Harkonnens," she said.
    "The Harkonnens!" he sneered. "Put those twisted humans out of your mind." He stared at his mother, studying the lines of her face in the light of the glowtab. The lines betrayed her. 
    She said: "You shouldn't refer to people as humans without--" 
    "Don't be so sure you know where to draw the line," he said. "We carry our past with us. And, mother mine, there's a thing you don't know and should--we are Harkonnens."
    Her mind did a terrifying thing: it blanked out as though it needed to shut off all sensation. But Paul's voice went on at that implacable pace, dragging her with it.
    "When next you find a mirror, study your face--study mine now. The traces are there if you don't blind yourself. Look at my hands, the set of my bones. And if none of this convinces you, then take my word for it. I've walked the future, I've looked at a record, I've seen a place, I have all the data. We're Harkonnens." 
    "A . . . renegade branch of the family," she said. "That's it, isn't it? Some Harkonnen cousin who--"
    "You're the Baron's own daughter," he said, and watched the way she pressed her hands to her mouth. "The Baron sampled many pleasures in his youth, and once permitted himself to be seduced. But it was for the genetic purposes of the Bene Gesserit, by one of you."
    The way he said 'you' struck her like a slap. But it set her mind to working and she could not deny his words. So many blank ends of meaning in her past reached out now and linked. The daughter the Bene Gesserit wanted--it wasn't to end the old Atreides-Harkonnen feud, but to fix some genetic factor in their lines. What? She groped for an answer.
    As though he saw inside her mind, Paul said: "They thought they were reaching for me. But I'm not what they expected, and I've arrived before my time. And they don't know it." 
    Jessica pressed her hands to her mouth. 
    Great Mother! He's the Kwisatz Haderach!
    She felt exposed and naked before him, realizing then that he saw her with eyes from which little could be hidden. And that, she knew, was the basis of her fear.
    "You're thinking I'm the Kwisatz Haderach," he said. "Put that out of your mind. I'm something unexpected."
    I must get word out to one of the schools, she thought. The mating index may show what has happened.
    "They won't learn about me until it's too late," he said.
    She sought to divert him, lowered her hands and said: "We'll find a place among the Fremen?"
    "The Fremen have a saying they credit to Shai-hulud, Old Father Eternity," he said. "They say: 'Be prepared to appreciate what you meet.' "
    And he thought: Yes, mother mine--among the Fremen. You'll acquire the blue eyes and a callus beside your lovely nose from the filter tube to your stillsuit . . . and you'll bear my sister: St. Alia of the Knife.
    "If you're not the Kwisatz Haderach," Jessica said, "what--" 
    "You couldn't possibly know," he said. "You won't believe it until you see it." 
    And he thought: I'm a seed.
    He suddenly saw how fertile was the ground into which he had fallen, and with this realization, the terrible purpose filled him, creeping through the empty place within, threatening to choke him with grief.
    He had seen two main branchings along the way ahead--in one he confronted an evil old Baron and said: "Hello, Grandfather." The thought of that path and what lay along it sickened him.
    The other path held long patches of grey obscurity except for peaks of violence. He had seen a warrior religion there, a fire spreading across the universe with the Atreides green and black banner waving at the head of fanatic legions drunk on spice liquor. Gurney Halleck and a few others of his father's men--a pitiful few--were among them, all marked by the hawk symbol from the shrine of his father's skull.
    "I can't go that way," he muttered. "That's what the old witches of your schools really want." 
    "I don't understand you, Paul," his mother said.
    He remained silent, thinking like the seed he was, thinking with the race consciousness he had first experienced as terrible purpose. He found that he no longer could hate the Bene Gesserit or the Emperor or even the Harkonnens. They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this--the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad. 
    Surely, I cannot choose that way, he thought.
    But he saw again in his mind's eye the shrine of his father's skull and the violence with the green and black banner waving in its midst.
    Jessica cleared her throat, worried by his silence. "Then . . . the Fremen will give us sanctuary?"
    He looked up, staring across the green-lighted tent at the inbred, patrician lines of her face. "Yes," he said. "That's one of the ways." He nodded. "Yes. They'll call me . . . Muad'Dib, 'The One Who Points the Way.' Yes . . . that's what they'll call me." 
    And he closed his eyes, thinking: Now, my father, I can mourn you. And he felt the tears coursing down his cheeks.

Book Two
MUAD'DIB

= = = = = =

When my father, the Padishah Emperor, heard of Duke Leto's death and the manner of it, he went into such a rage as we had never before seen. He blamed my mother and the compact forced on him to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne. He blamed the Guild and the evil old Baron. He blamed everyone in sight, not excepting even me, for he said I was a witch like all the others. And when I sought to comfort him, saying it was done according to an older law of self-preservation to which even the most ancient rulers gave allegiance, he sneered at me and asked if I thought him a weakling. I saw then that he had been aroused to this passion not by concern over the dead Duke but by what that death implied for all royalty. As I look back on it, I think there may have been some prescience in my father, too, for it is certain that his line and Muad'Dib's shared common ancestry.
-"In My Father's House," by the Princess Irulan

    "Now Harkonnen shall kill Harkonnen," Paul whispered.
    He had awakened shortly before nightfall, sitting up in the sealed and darkened stilltent. As he spoke, he heard the vague stirrings of his mother where she slept against the tent's opposite wall.
    Paul glanced at the proximity detector on the floor, studying the dials illuminated in the blackness by phosphor tubes.
    "It should be night soon," his mother said. "Why don't you lift the tent shades?"
    Paul realized then that her breathing had been different for some time, that she had lain silent in the darkness until certain he was awake.
    "Lifting the shades wouldn't help," he said. "There's been a storm. The tent's covered by sand. I'll dig us out soon." 
    "No sign of Duncan yet?" 
    "None."
    Paul rubbed absently at the ducal signet on his thumb, and a sudden rage against the very substance of this planet which had helped kill his father set him trembling. 
    "I heard the storm begin," Jessica said.
    The undemanding emptiness of her words helped restore some of his calm. His mind focused on the storm as he had seen it begin through the transparent end of their stilltent--cold dribbles of sand crossing the basin, then runnels and tails furrowing the sky. He had looked up to a rock spire, seen it change shape under the blast, becoming a low, Cheddar-colored wedge. Sand funneled into their basin had shadowed the sky with dull curry, then blotted out all light as the tent was covered.
    Tent bows had creaked once as they accepted the pressure, then--silence broken only by the dim bellows wheezing of their sand snorkel pumping air from the surface. 
    "Try the receiver again," Jessica said. 
    "No use," he said.
    He found his stillsuit's watertube in its clip at his neck, drew a warm swallow into his mouth, and he thought that here he truly began an Arrakeen existence--living on reclaimed moisture from his own breath and body. It was flat and tasteless water, but it soothed his throat.
    Jessica heard Paul drinking, felt the slickness of her own stillsuit clinging to her body, but she refused to accept her thirst. To accept it would require awakening fully into the terrible necessities of Arrakis where they must guard even fractional traces of moisture, hoarding the few drops in the tent's catchpockets, begrudging a breath wasted on the open air.
    So much easier to drift back down into sleep.
    But there had been a dream in this day's sleep, and she shivered at memory of it. She had held dreaming hands beneath sandflow where a name had been written: Duke Leto Atreides. The name had blurred with the sand and she had moved to restore it, but the first letter filled before the last was begun. 
    The sand would not stop.
    Her dream became wailing: louder and louder. That ridiculous wailing--part of her mind had realized the sound was her own voice as a tiny child, little more than a baby. A woman not quite visible to memory was going away.
    My unknown mother, Jessica thought. The Bene Gesserit who bore me and gave me to the Sisters because that's what she was commanded to do. Was she glad to rid herself of a Harkonnen child?
    "The place to hit them is in the spice," Paul said. 
    How can he think of attack at a time like this? she asked herself.
    "An entire planet full of spice," she said. "How can you hit them there?"
    She heard him stirring, the sound of their pack being dragged across the tent floor.
    "It was sea power and air power on Caladan," he said. "Here, it's desert power. The Fremen are the key."
    His voice came from the vicinity of the tent's sphincter. Her Bene Gesserit training sensed in his tone an unresolved bitterness toward her.
    All his life he has been trained to hate Harkonnens, she thought. Now, he finds he is Harkonnen . . . because of me. How little he knows me! I was my Duke's only woman. I accepted his life and his values even to defying my Bene Gesserit orders.
    The tent's glowtab came alight under Paul's hand, filled the domed area with green radiance. Paul crouched at the sphincter, his stillsuit hood adjusted for the open desert--forehead capped, mouth filter in place, nose plugs adjusted. Only his dark eyes were visible: a narrow band of face that turned once toward her and away.
    "Secure yourself for the open," he said, and his voice was blurred behind the filter.
    Jessica pulled the filter across her mouth, began adjusting her hood as she watched Paul break the tent seal.
    Sand rasped as he opened the sphincter and a burred fizzle of grains ran into the tent before he could immobilize it with a static compaction tool. A hole grew in the sandwall as the tool realigned the grains. He slipped out and her ears followed his progress to the surface.
    What will we find out there? she wondered. Harkonnen troops and the Sardaukar, those are dangers we can expect. But what of the dangers we don't know?
    She thought of the compaction tool and the other strange instruments in the pack. Each of these tools suddenly stood in her mind as a sign of mysterious dangers.
    She felt then a hot breeze from surface sand touch her cheeks where they were exposed above the filter.
    "Pass up the pack." It was Paul's voice, low and guarded.
    She moved to obey, heard the water literjons gurgle as she shoved the pack across the floor. She peered upward, saw Paul framed against stars.
    "Here," he said and reached down, pulled the pack to the surface.
    Now she saw only the circle of stars. They were like the luminous tips of weapons aimed down at her. A shower of meteors crossed her patch of night. The meteors seemed to her like a warning, like tiger stripes, like luminous grave slats clabbering her blood. And she felt the chill of the price on their heads. 
    "Hurry up," Paul said. "I want to collapse the tent." 
    A shower of sand from the surface brushed her left hand. How much sand will the hand hold? She asked herself.
    "Shall I help you?" Paul asked. 
    "No."
    She swallowed in a dry throat, slipped into the hole, felt static-packed sand rasp under her hands. Paul reached down, took her arm. She stood beside him on a smooth patch of starlit desert, stared around. Sand almost brimmed their basin, leaving only a dim lip of surrounding rock. She probed the farther darkness with her trained senses.
    Noise of small animals. 
    Birds.
    A fall of dislodged sand and faint creature sounds within it. 
    Paul collapsing their tent, recovering it up the hole.
    Starlight displaced just enough of the night to charge each shadow with menace. She looked at patches of blackness.
    Black is a blind remembering, she thought. You listen for pack sounds, for the cries of those who hunted your ancestors in a past so ancient only your most primitive cells remember. The ears see. The nostrils see.
    Presently, Paul stood beside her, said: "Duncan told me that if he was captured, he could hold out . . . this long. We must leave here now." He shouldered the pack, crossed to the shallow lip of the basin, climbed to a ledge that looked down on open desert.
    Jessica followed automatically, noting how she now lived in her son's orbit.
    For now is my grief heavier than the sands of the seas, she thought. This world has emptied me of all but the oldest purpose: tomorrow's life. I live now for my young Duke and the daughter yet to be.
    She felt the sand drag her feet as she climbed to Paul's side.
    He looked north across a line of rocks, studying a distant escarpment.
    The faraway rock profile was like an ancient battleship of the seas outlined by stars. The long swish of it lifted on an invisible wave with syllables of boomerang antennae, funnels arcing back, a pi-shaped upthrusting at the stern.
    An orange glare burst above the silhouette and a line of brilliant purple cut downward toward the glare. 
    Another line of purple!
    And another upthrusting orange glare!
    It was like an ancient naval battle, remembered shellfire, and the sight held them staring.
    "Pillars of fire," Paul whispered.
    A ring of red eyes lifted over the distant rock. Lines of purple laced the sky.
    "Jetflares and lasguns," Jessica said.
    The dust-reddened first moon of Arrakis lifted above the horizon to their left and they saw a storm trail there--a ribbon of movement over the desert.
    "It must be Harkonnen 'thopters hunting us," Paul said. "The way they're cutting up the desert . . . it's as though they were making certain they stamped out whatever's there . . . the way you'd stamp out a nest of insects." 
    "Or a nest of Atreides," Jessica said.
    "We must seek cover," Paul said. "We'll head south and keep to the rocks. If they caught us in the open . . ." He turned, adjusting the pack to his shoulders. "They're killing anything that moves."
    He took one step along the ledge and, in that instant, heard the low hiss of gliding aircraft, saw the dark shapes of ornithopters above them.

My father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. "Something cannot emerge from nothing," he said. This is profound thinking if you understand how unstable "the truth" can be.
-from "Conversations with Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    "I've always prided myself on seeing things the way they truly are," Thufir Hawat said. "That's the curse of being a Mentat. You can't stop analyzing your data."
    The leathered old face appeared composed in the predawn dimness as he spoke. His sapho-stained lips were drawn into a straight line with radial creases spreading upward.
    A robed man squatted silently on sand across from Hawat, apparently unmoved by the words.
    The two crouched beneath a rock overhang that looked down on a wide, shallow sink. Dawn was spreading over the shattered outline of cliffs across the basin, touching everything with pink. It was cold under the overhang, a dry and penetrating chill left over from the night. There had been a warm wind just before dawn, but now it was cold. Hawat could hear teeth chattering behind him among the few troopers remaining in his force.
    The man squatting across from Hawat was a Fremen who had come across the sink in the first light of false dawn, skittering over the sand, blending into the dunes, his movements barely discernible.
    The Fremen extended a finger to the sand between them, drew a figure there. It looked like a bowl with an arrow spilling out of it. "There are many Harkonnen patrols," he said. He lifted his finger, pointed upward across the cliffs that Hawat and his men had descended.
    Hawat nodded. 
    Many patrols. Yes.
    But still he did not know what this Fremen wanted and this rankled. Mentat training was supposed to give a man the power to see motives.
    This had been the worst night of Hawat's life. He had been at Tsimpo, a garrison village, buffer outpost for the former capital city, Carthag, when the reports of attack began arriving. At first, he'd thought: It's a raid. The Harkonnens are testing. 
    But report followed report--faster and faster. 
    Two legions landed at Carthag.
    Five legions--fifty brigades! --attacking the Duke's main base at Arrakeen.
    A legion at Arsunt.
    Two battle groups at Splintered Rock.
    Then the reports became more detailed--there were Imperial Sardaukar among the attackers--possibly two legions of them. And it became clear that the invaders knew precisely which weight of arms to send where. Precisely! Superb Intelligence.
    Hawat's shocked fury had mounted until it threatened the smooth functioning of his Mentat capabilities. The size of the attack struck his mind like a physical blow.
    Now, hiding beneath a bit of desert rock, he nodded to himself, pulled his torn and slashed tunic around him as though warding off the cold shadows.
    The size of the attack.
    He had always expected their enemy to hire an occasional lighter from the Guild for probing raids. That was an ordinary enough gambit in this kind of House-to-House warfare. Lighters landed and took off on Arrakis regularly to transport the spice for House Atreides. Hawat had taken precautions against random raids by false spice lighters. For a full attack they'd expected no more than ten brigades.
    But there were more than two thousand ships down on Arrakis at the last count--not just lighters, but frigates, scouts, monitors, crushers, troop-carriers, dump-boxes . . . 
    More than a hundred brigades--ten legions!
    The entire spice income of Arrakis for fifty years might just cover the cost of such a venture. 
    It might.
    I underestimated what the Baron was willing to spend in attacking us, Hawat thought. I failed my Duke. 
    Then there was the matter of the traitor.
    I will live long enough to see her strangled! he thought. I should've killed that Bene Gesserit witch when I had the chance. There was no doubt in his mind who had betrayed them--the Lady Jessica. She fitted all the facts available.
    "Your man Gurney Halleck and part of his force are safe with our smuggler friends," the Fremen said. 
    "Good." 
    So Gurney will get off this hell planet. We 're not all gone.
    Hawat glanced back at the huddle of his men. He had started the night just past with three hundred of his finest. Of those, an even twenty remained and half of them were wounded. Some of them slept now, standing up, leaning against the rock, sprawled on the sand beneath the rock. Their last 'thopter, the one they'd been using as a ground-effect machine to carry their wounded, had given out just before dawn. They had cut it up with lasguns and hidden the pieces, then worked their way down into this hiding place at the edge of the basin.
    Hawat had only a rough idea of their location--some two hundred kilometers southeast of Arrakeen. The main traveled ways between the Shield Wall sietch communities were somewhere south of them.
    The Fremen across from Hawat threw back his hood and stillsuit cap to reveal sandy hair and beard. The hair was combed straight back from a high, thin forehead. He had the unreadable total blue eyes of the spice diet. Beard and mustache were stained at one side of the mouth, his hair matted there by pressure of the looping catchtube from his nose plugs.
    The man removed his plugs, readjusted them. He rubbed at a scar beside his nose.
    "If you cross the sink here this night," the Fremen said, "you must not use shields. There is a break in the wall . . . " He turned on his heels, pointed south. " . . . there, and it is open sand down to the erg. Shields will attract a . . . " He hesitated. ". . . worm. They don't often come in here, but a shield will bring one every time." 
    He said worm, Hawat thought. He was going to say something else. What? And what does he want of us? 
    Hawat sighed.
    He could not recall ever before being this tired. It was a muscle weariness that energy pills were unable to ease. 
    Those damnable Sardaukar!
    With a self-accusing bitterness, he faced the thought of the soldier-fanatics and the Imperial treachery they represented. His own Mentat assessment of the data told him how little chance he had ever to present evidence of this treachery before the High Council of the Landsraad where justice might be done.
    "Do you wish to go to the smugglers?" the Fremen asked. 
    "Is it possible?" 
    "The way is long." 
    "Fremen don't like to say no," Idaho had told him once.
    Hawat said: "You haven't yet told me whether your people can help my wounded." 
    "They are wounded." 
    The same damned answer every time!
    "We know they're wounded!" Hawat snapped. "That's not the--"
    "Peace, friend," the Fremen cautioned. "What do your wounded say? Are there those among them who can see the water need of your tribe?" 
    "We haven't talked about water," Hawat said. "We--" 
    "I can understand your reluctance," the Fremen said. "They are your friends, your tribesmen. Do you have water?" 
    "Not enough."
    The Fremen gestured to Hawat's tunic, the skin exposed beneath it. "You were caught in-sietch, without your suits. You must make a water decision, friend." 
    "Can we hire your help?"
    The Fremen shrugged. "You have no water." He glanced at the group behind Hawat. "How many of your wounded would you spend?"
    Hawat fell silent, staring at the man. He could see as a Mentat that their communication was out of phase. Word-sounds were not being linked up here in the normal manner.
    "I am Thufir Hawat," he said. "I can speak for my Duke. I will make promissory commitment now for your help. I wish a limited form of help, preserving my force long enough only to kill a traitor who thinks herself beyond vengeance." 
    "You wish our siding in a vendetta?"
    "The vendetta I'll handle myself. I wish to be freed of responsibility for my wounded that I may get about it." 
    The Fremen scowled. "How can you be responsible for your wounded? They are their own responsibility. The water's at issue, Thufir Hawat. Would you have me take that decision away from you?" 
    The man put a hand to a weapon concealed beneath his robe. 
    Hawat tensed, wondering: Is there betrayal here? 
    "What do you fear?" the Fremen demanded.
    These people and their disconcerting directness! Hawat spoke cautiously. "There's a price on my head."
    "Ah-h-h-h." The Fremen removed his hand from his weapon. "You think we have the Byzantine corruption. You don't know us. The Harkonnens have not water enough to buy the smallest child among us."
    But they had the price of Guild passage for more than two thousand fighting ships, Hawat thought. And the size of that price still staggered him.
    "We both fight Harkonnens," Hawat said. "Should we not share the problems and ways of meeting the battle issue?" 
    "We are sharing," the Fremen said. "I have seen you fight Harkonnens. You are good. There've been times I'd have appreciated your arm beside me." 
    "Say where my arm may help you," Hawat said.
    "Who knows?" the Fremen asked. "There are Harkonnen forces everywhere. But you still have not made the water decision or put it to your wounded."
    I must be cautious, Hawat told himself. There's a thing here that's not understood.
    He said: "Will you show me your way, the Arrakeen way?" 
    "Stranger-thinking," the Fremen said, and there was a sneer in his tone. He pointed to the northwest across the clifftop. "We watched you come across the sand last night." He lowered his arm. "You keep your force on the slip-face of the dunes. Bad. You have no stillsuits, no water. You will not last long." 
    "The ways of Arrakis don't come easily," Hawat said. 
    "Truth. But we've killed Harkonnens." 
    "What do you do with your own wounded? "Hawat demanded.
    "Does a man not know when he is worth saving?" the Fremen asked. "Your wounded know you have no water." He tilted his head, looking sideways up at Hawat. "This is clearly a time for water decision. Both wounded and unwounded must look to the tribe's future."
    The tribe's future, Hawat thought. The tribe of Atreides. There's sense in that. He forced himself to the question he had been avoiding.
    "Have you word of my Duke or his son?" 
    Unreadable blue eyes stared upward into Hawat's. "Word?" 
    "Their fate!" Hawat snapped.
    "Fate is the same for everyone," the Fremen said. "Your Duke, it is said, has met his fate. As to the Lisan al-Gaib, his son, that is in Liet's hands. Liet has not said." 
    I knew the answer without asking, Hawat thought.
    He glanced back at his men. They were all awake now. They had heard. They were staring out across the sand, the realization in their expressions: there was no returning to Caladan for them, and now Arrakis was lost.
    Hawat turned back to the Fremen. "Have you heard of Duncan Idaho?"
    "He was in the great house when the shield went down," the Fremen said. "This I've heard . . . no more."
    She dropped the shield and let in the Harkonnens, he thought. I was the one who sat with my back to a door. How could she do this when it meant turning also against her own son? But . . . who knows how a Bene Gesserit witch thinks . . . if you can call it thinking?
    Hawat tried to swallow in a dry throat. "When will you hear about the boy?"
    "We know little of what happens in Arrakeen," the Fremen said. He shrugged. "Who knows?" 
    "You have ways of finding out?"
    "Perhaps." The Fremen rubbed at the scar beside his nose. "Tell me, Thufir Hawat, do you have knowledge of the big weapons the Harkonnens used?"
    The artillery, Hawat thought bitterly. Who could have guessed they'd use artillery in this day of shields?
    "You refer to the artillery they used to trap our people in the caves," he said. "I've . . . theoretical knowledge of such explosive weapons."
    "Any man who retreats into a cave which has only one opening deserves to die," the Fremen said.
    "Why do you ask about these weapons?" 
    "Liet wishes it."
    Is that what he wants from us? Hawat wondered. He said: "Did you come here seeking information about the big guns?" 
    "Liet wished to see one of the weapons for himself." 
    "Then you should just go take one," Hawat sneered.
    "Yes," the Fremen said. "We took one. We have it hidden where Stilgar can study it for Liet and where Liet can see it for himself if he wishes. But I doubt he'll want to: the weapon is not a very good one. Poor design for Arrakis." 
    "You . . . took one?" Hawat asked.
    "It was a good fight," the Fremen said. "We lost only two men and spilled the water from more than a hundred of theirs." 
    There were Sardaukar at every gun, Hawat thought. This desert madman speaks casually of losing only two men against Sardaukar!
    "We would not have lost the two except for those others fighting beside the Harkonnens," the Fremen said. "Some of those are good fighters."
    One of Hawat's men limped forward, looked down at the squatting Fremen. "Are you talking about Sardaukar?" 
    "He's talking about Sardaukar," Hawat said.
    "Sardaukar!" the Fremen said, and there appeared to be glee in his voice. "Ah-h-h, so that's what they are! This was a good night indeed. Sardaukar. Which legion? Do you know?" 
    "We . . . don't know," Hawat said.
    "Sardaukar," the Fremen mused. "Yet they wear Harkonnen clothing. Is that not strange?"
    "The Emperor does not wish it known he fights against a Great House," Hawat said.
    "But you know they are Sardaukar." 
    "Who am I?" Hawat asked bitterly.
    "You are Thufir Hawat," the man said matter-of-factly. "Well, we would have learned it in time. We've sent three of them captive to be questioned by Liet's men."
    Hawat's aide spoke slowly, disbelief in every word: "You . . . captured Sardaukar?" 
    "Only three of them," the Fremen said. "They fought well." 
    If only we'd had the time to link up with these Fremen, Hawat thought. It was a sour lament in his mind. If only we could've trained them and armed them. Great Mother, what a fighting force we'd have had!
    "Perhaps you delay because of worry over the Lisan al-Gaib," the Fremen said. "If he is truly the Lisan al-Gaib, harm cannot touch him. Do not spend thoughts on a matter which has not been proved."
    "I serve the . . . Lisan al-Gaib," Hawat said. "His welfare is my concern. I've pledged myself to this." 
    "You are pledged to his water?"
    Hawat glanced at his aide, who was still staring at the Fremen, returned his attention to the squatting figure. "To his water, yes." 
    "You wish to return to Arrakeen, to the place of his water?" 
    "To . . . yes, to the place of his water."
    "Why did you not say at first it was a water matter?" The Fremen stood up, seated his nose plugs firmly.
    Hawat motioned with his head for his aide to return to the others. With a tired shrug, the man obeyed. Hawat heard a low-voiced conversation arise among the men.
    The Fremen said: "There is always a way to water." 
    Behind Hawat, a man cursed. Hawat's aide called: "Thufir! Arkie just died."
    The Fremen put a fist to his ear. "The bond of water! It's a sign!" He stared at Hawat. "We have a place nearby for accepting the water. Shall I call my men?"
    The aide returned to Hawat's side, said: "Thufir, a couple of the men left wives in Arrakeen. They're . . . well, you know how it is at a time like this."
    The Fremen still held his fist to his ear. "Is it the bond of water, Thufir Hawat?" he demanded.
    Hawat's mind was racing. He sensed now the direction of the Fremen's words, but feared the reaction of the tired men under the rock overhang when they understood it. 
    "The bond of water," Hawat said.
    "Let our tribes be joined," the Fremen said, and he lowered his fist.
    As though that were the signal, four men slid and dropped down from the rocks above them. They darted back under the overhang, rolled the dead man in a loose robe, lifted him and began running with him along the cliff wall to the right. Spurts of dust lifted around their running feet.
    It was over before Hawat's tired men could gather their wits. The group with the body hanging like a sack in its enfolding robe was gone around a turn in the cliff.
    One of Hawat's men shouted: "Where they going with Arkie? He was--" 
    "They're taking him to . . . bury him," Hawat said. 
    "Fremen don't bury their dead!" the man barked. "Don't you try any tricks on us, Thufir. We know what they do. Arkie was one of--"
    "Paradise were sure for a man who died in the service of Lisan al-Gaib," the Fremen said. "If it is the Lisan al-Gaib you serve, as you have said it, why raise mourning cries? The memory of one who died in this fashion will live as long as the memory of man endures."
    But Hawat's men advanced, angry looks on their faces. One had captured a lasgun. He started to draw it.
    "Stop right where you are!" Hawat barked. He fought down the sick fatigue that gripped his muscles. "These people respect our dead. Customs differ, but the meaning's the same." 
    "They're going to render Arkie down for his water," the man with the lasgun snarled.
    "Is it that your men wish to attend the ceremony?" the Fremen asked.
    He doesn't even see the problem, Hawat thought. The naivete of the Fremen was frightening.
    "They're concerned for a respected comrade," Hawat said.
    "We will treat your comrade with the same reverence we treat our own," the Fremen said. "This is the bond of water. We know the rites. A man's flesh is his own; the water belongs to the tribe." 
    Hawat spoke quickly as the man with the lasgun advanced another step. "Will you now help our wounded?" 
    "One does not question the bond," the Fremen said. "We will do for you what a tribe does for its own. First, we must get all of you suited and see to the necessities." 
    The man with the lasgun hesitated.
    Hawat's aide said: "Are we buying help with Arkie's . . . water?" 
    "Not buying," Hawat said. "We've joined these people." 
    "Customs differ," one of his men muttered. 
    Hawat began to relax.
    "And they'll help us get to Arrakeen?"
    "We will kill Harkonnens," the Fremen said. He grinned. "And Sardaukar." He stepped backward, cupped his hands beside his ears and tipped his head back, listening. Presently, he lowered his hands, said: "An aircraft comes. Conceal yourselves beneath the rock and remain' motionless." 
    At a gesture from Hawat, his men obeyed.
    The Fremen took Hawat's arm, pressed him back with the others. "We will fight in the time of fighting," the man said. He reached beneath his robes, brought out a small cage, lifted a creature from it.
    Hawat recognized a tiny bat. The bat turned its head and Hawat saw its blue-within-blue eyes.
    The Fremen stroked the bat, soothing it, crooning to it. He bent over the animal's head, allowed a drop of saliva to fall from his tongue into the bat's upturned mouth. The bat stretched its wings, but remained on the Fremen's opened hand. The man took a tiny tube, held it beside the bat's head and chattered into the tube; then, lifting the creature high, he threw it upward.
    The bat swooped away beside the cliff and was lost to sight.
    The Fremen folded the cage, thrust it beneath his robe. Again, he bent his head, listening. "They quarter the high country," he said. "One wonders who they seek up there." 
    "It's known that we retreated in this direction," Hawat said.
    "One should never presume one is the sole object of a hunt," the Fremen said. "Watch the other side of the basin. You will see a thing." 
    Time passed.
    Some of Hawat's men stirred, whispering.
    "Remain silent as frightened animals," the Fremen hissed.
    Hawat discerned movement near the opposite cliff--flitting blurs of tan on tan.
    "My little friend carried his message," the Fremen said. "He is a good messenger--day or night. I'll be unhappy to lose that one." 
    The movement across the sink faded away. On the entire four to five kilometer expanse of sand nothing remained but the growing pressure of the day's heat--blurred columns of rising air. 
    "Be most silent now," the Fremen whispered.
    A file of plodding figures emerged from a break in the opposite cliff, headed directly across the sink. To Hawat, they appeared to be Fremen, but a curiously inept band. He counted six men making heavy going of it over the dunes.
    A "thwok-thwok" of ornithopter wings sounded high to the right behind Hawat's group. The craft came over the cliff wall above them--an Atreides 'thopter with Harkonnen battle colors splashed on it. The 'thopter swooped toward the men crossing the sink. 
    The group there stopped on a dune crest, waved.
    The 'thopter circled once over them in a tight curve, came back for a dust-shrouded landing in front of the Fremen. Five men swarmed from the 'thopter and Hawat saw the dust-repellent shimmering of shields and, in their motions, the hard competence of Sardaukar.
    "Aiihh! They use their stupid shields," the Fremen beside Hawat hissed. He glanced toward the open south wall of the sink.
    "They are Sardaukar," Hawat whispered. 
    "Good."
    The Sardaukar approached the waiting group of Fremen in an enclosing half-circle. Sun glinted on blades held ready. The Fremen stood in a compact group, apparently indifferent.
    Abruptly, the sand around the two groups sprouted Fremen. They were at the ornithopter, then in it. Where the two groups had met at the dune crest, a dust cloud partly obscured violent motion. 
    Presently, dust settled. Only Fremen remained standing.
    "They left only three men in their 'thopter," the Fremen beside Hawat said. "That was fortunate. I don't believe we had to damage the craft in taking it."
    Behind Hawat, one of his men whispered: "Those were Sardaukar!" 
    "Did you notice how well they fought?" the Fremen asked.
    Hawat took a deep breath. He smelled the burned dust around him, felt the heat, the dryness. In a voice to match that dryness, he said: "Yes, they fought well, indeed."
    The captured 'thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings, angled upward to the south in a steep, wing-tucked climb. 
    So these Fremen can handle 'thopters, too, Hawat thought.
    On the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once . . . twice.
    "More come!" the Fremen beside Hawat barked. "Be ready. I'd hoped to have us away without more inconvenience." 
    Inconvenience! Hawat thought.
    He saw two more 'thopters swooping from high in the west onto an area of sand suddenly devoid of visible Fremen. Only eight splotches of blue--the bodies of the Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniforms--remained at the scene of violence.
    Another 'thopter glided in over the cliff wall above Hawat. He drew in a sharp breath as he saw it--a big troop carrier. It flew with the slow, spread-wing heaviness of a full load--like a giant bird coming to its nest.
    In the distance, the purple finger of a lasgun beam flicked from one of the diving 'thopters. It laced across the sand, raising a sharp trail of dust.
    "The cowards!" the Fremen beside Hawat rasped.
    The troop carrier settled toward the patch of blue-clad bodies. Its wings crept out to full reach, began the cupping action of a quick stop.
    Hawat's attention was caught by a flash of sun on metal to the south, a 'thopter plummeting there in a power dive, wings folded flat against its sides, its jets a golden flare against the dark silvered gray of the sky. It plunged like an arrow toward the troop carrier which was unshielded because of the lasgun activity around it. Straight into the carrier the diving 'thopter plunged.
    A flaming roar shook the basin. Rocks tumbled from the cliff walls all around. A geyser of red-orange shot skyward from the sand where the carrier and its companion 'thopters had been--everything there caught in the flame.
    It was the Fremen who took off in that captured 'thopter, Hawat thought. He deliberately sacrificed himself to get that carrier. Great Mother! What are these Fremen?
    "A reasonable exchange," said the Fremen beside Hawat. "There must've been three hundred men in that carrier. Now, we must see to their water and make plans to get another aircraft." He started to step out of their rock-shadowed concealment.
    A rain of blue uniforms came over the cliff wall in front of him, falling in low-suspensor slowness. In the flashing instant, Hawat had time to see that they were Sardaukar, hard faces set in battle frenzy, that they were unshielded and each carried a knife in one hand, a stunner in the other.
    A thrown knife caught Hawat's Fremen companion in the throat, hurting him backward, twisting face down. Hawat had only time to draw his own knife before blackness of a stunner projectile felled him.

-from "Arrakis Awakening" by the Princess Irulan

    As the ornithopters glided out of the night above them, Paul grabbed his mother's arm, snapped: "Don't move!" 
    Then he saw the lead craft in the moonlight, the way its wings cupped to brake for landing, the reckless dash of the hands at the controls.
    "It's Idaho," he breathed.
    The craft and its companions settled into the basin like a covey of birds coming to nest. Idaho was out of his 'thopter and running toward them before the dust settled. Two figures in Fremen robes followed him. Paul recognized one: the tall, sandy-bearded Kynes. 
    "This way!" Kynes called and he veered left.
    Behind Kynes, other Fremen were throwing fabric covers over their ornithopters. The craft became a row of shallow dunes.
    Idaho skidded to a stop in front of Paul, saluted. "M'Lord, the Fremen have a temporary hiding place nearby where we--" 
    "What about that back there?"
    Paul pointed to the violence above the distant cliff--the jetflares, the purple beams of lasguns lacing the desert.
    A rare smile touched Idaho's round, placid face. "M'Lord . . . Sire, I've left them a little sur--"
    Glaring white light filled the desert--bright as a sun, etching their shadows onto the rock floor of the ledge. In one sweeping motion, Idaho had Paul's arm in one hand, Jessica's shoulder in the other, hurling them down off the ledge into the basin. They sprawled together in the sand as the roar of an explosion thundered over them. Its shock wave tumbled chips off the rock ledge they had vacated. 
    Idaho sat up, brushed sand from himself.
    "Not the family atomics!" Jessica said. "I thought--" 
    "You planted a shield back there," Paul said.
    "A big one turned to full force," Idaho said. "A lasgun beam touched it and . . . " He shrugged.
    "Subatomic fusion," Jessica said. "That's a dangerous weapon."
    "Not weapon, m'Lady, defense. That scum will think twice before using lasguns another time."
    The Fremen from the ornithopters stopped above them. One called in a low voice: "We should get under cover, friends." 
    Paul got to his feet as Idaho helped Jessica up. 
    "That blast will attract considerable attention, Sire," Idaho said. 
    Sire, Paul thought.
    The word had such a strange sound when directed at him. Sire had always been his father.
    He felt himself touched briefly by his powers of prescience, seeing himself infected by the wild race consciousness that was moving the human universe toward chaos. The vision left him shaken, and he allowed Idaho to guide him along the edge of the basin to a rock projection. Fremen there were opening a way down into the sand with their compaction tools. 
    "May I take your pack, Sire?" Idaho asked. 
    "It's not heavy, Duncan," Paul said.
    "You have no body shield," Idaho said. "Do you wish mine?" He glanced at the distant cliff. "Not likely there'll be any more lasgun activity about."
    "Keep your shield, Duncan. Your right arm is shield enough for me."
    Jessica saw the way the praise took effect, how Idaho moved closer to Paul, and she thought: Such a sure hand my son has with his people.
    The Fremen removed a rock plug that opened a passage down into the native basement complex of the desert. A camouflage cover was rigged for the opening.
    "This way," one of the Fremen said, and he led them down rock steps into darkness.
    Behind them, the cover blotted out the moonlight. A dim green glow came alive ahead, revealing the steps and rock walls, a turn to the left. Robed Fremen were all around them now, pressing downward. They rounded the corner, found another down-slanting passage. It opened into a rough cave chamber.
    Kynes stood before them, jubba hood thrown back. The neck of his stillsuit glistening in the green light. His long hair and beard were mussed. The blue eyes without whites were a darkness under heavy brows.
    In the moment of encounter, Kynes wondered at himself: Why am I helping these people? It's the most dangerous thing I've ever done. It could doom me with them.
    Then he looked squarely at Paul, seeing the boy who had taken on the mantle of manhood, masking grief, suppressing all except the position that now must be assumed--the dukedom. And Kynes realized in that moment the dukedom still existed and solely because of this youth--and this was not a thing to be taken lightly.
    Jessica glanced once around the chamber, registering it on her senses in the Bene Gesserit way--a laboratory, a civil place full of angles and squares in the ancient manner.
    "This is one of the Imperial Ecological Testing Stations my father wanted as advance bases," Paul said.
    His father wanted! Kynes thought.
    And again Kynes wondered at himself. Am I foolish to aid these fugitives? Why am I doing it? It'd be so easy to take them now, to buy the Harkonnen trust with them.
    Paul followed his mother's example, gestalting the room, seeing the workbench down one side, the walls of featureless rock. Instruments lined the bench--dials glowing, wire gridex planes with fluting glass emerging from them. An ozone smell permeated the place.
    Some of the Fremen moved on around a concealing angle in the chamber and new sounds started there--machine coughs, the whinnies of spinning belts and multidrives.
    Paul looked to the end of the room, saw cages with small animals in them stacked against the wall.
    "You've recognized this place correctly," Kynes said. "For what would you use such a place, Paul Atreides?" 
    "To make this planet a fit place for humans," Paul said. 
    Perhaps that's why I help them, Kynes thought.
    The machine sounds abruptly hummed away to silence. Into this void there came a thin animal squeak from the cages. It was cut off abruptly as though in embarrassment.
    Paul returned his attention to the cages, saw that the animals were brown-winged bats. An automatic feeder extended from the side wall across the cages.
    A Fremen emerged from the hidden area of the chamber, spoke to Kynes: "Liet, the field-generator equipment is not working. I am unable to mask us from proximity detectors." 
    "Can you repair it?" Kynes asked.
    "Not quickly. The parts . . . " The man shrugged.
    "Yes," Kynes said. "Then we'll do without machinery. Get a hand pump for air out to the surface." 
    "Immediately." The man hurried away.
    Kynes turned back to Paul. "You gave a good answer." 
    Jessica marked the easy rumble of the man's voice. It was a royal voice, accustomed to command. And she had not missed the reference to him as Liet. Liet was the Fremen alter ego, the other face of the tame planetologist.
    "We're most grateful for your help, Doctor Kynes," she said.
    "Mm-m-m, we'll see," Kynes said. He nodded to one of his men. "Spice coffee in my quarters, Shamir." 
    "At once, Liet," the man said.
    Kynes indicated an arched opening in the side wall of the chamber. "If you please?"
    Jessica allowed herself a regal nod before accepting. She saw Paul give a hand signal to Idaho, telling him to mount guard here.
    The passage, two paces deep, opened through a heavy door into a square office lighted by golden glowglobes. Jessica passed her hand across the door as she entered, was startled to identify plasteel.
    Paul stepped three paces into the room, dropped his pack to the floor. He heard the door close behind him, studied the place--about eight meters to a side, walls of natural rock, curry-colored, broken by metal filing cabinets on their right. A low desk with milk glass top shot full of yellow bubbles occupied the room's center. Four suspensor chairs ringed the desk.
    Kynes moved around Paul, held a chair for Jessica. She sat down, noting the way her son examined the room.
    Paul remained standing for another eyeblink. A faint anomaly in the room's air currents told him there was a secret exit to their right behind the filing cabinets.
    "Will you sit down, Paul Atreides?" Kynes asked.
    How carefully he avoids my title, Paul thought. But he accepted the chair, remained silent while Kynes sat down.
    "You sense that Arrakis could be a paradise," Kynes said. "Yet, as you see, the Imperium sends here only its trained hatchetmen, its seekers after the spice!"
    Paul held up his thumb with its ducal signet. "Do you see this ring?" 
    "Yes." 
    "Do you know its significance?" 
    Jessica turned sharply to stare at her son.
    "Your father lies dead in the ruins of Arrakeen," Kynes said. "You are technically the Duke."
    "I'm a soldier of the Imperium," Paul said, "technically a hatchetman."
    Kynes face darkened. "Even with the Emperor's Sardaukar standing over your father's body?"
    "The Sardaukar are one thing, the legal source of my authority is another," Paul said.
    "Arrakis has its own way of determining who wears the mantle of authority," Kynes said.
    And Jessica, turning back to look at him, thought: There's steel in this man that no one has taken the temper out of . . . and we've need of steel. Paul's doing a dangerous thing.
    Paul said: "The Sardaukar on Arrakis are a measure of how much our beloved Emperor feared my father. Now, I will give the Padishah Emperor reasons to fear the--"
    "Lad," Kynes said, "there are things you don't--"
    "You will address me as Sire or my Lord," Paul said. 
    Gently, Jessica thought.
    Kynes stared at Paul, and Jessica noted the glint of admiration in the planetologist's face, the touch of humor there. 
    "Sire," Kynes said.
    "I am an embarrassment to the Emperor," Paul said. "I am an embarrassment to all who would divide Arrakis as their spoil. As I live, I shall continue to be such an embarrassment that I stick in their throats and choke them to death!" 
    "Words," Kynes said.
    Paul stared at him. Presently, Paul said: "You have a legend of the Lisan al-Gaib here, the Voice from the Outer World, the one who will lead the Fremen to paradise. Your men have--" 
    "Superstition!" Kynes said.
    "Perhaps, "Paul agreed. "Yet perhaps not. Superstitions sometimes have strange roots and stranger branchings." 
    "You have a plan," Kynes said. "This much is obvious . . . Sire."
    "Could your Fremen provide me with proof positive that the Sardaukar are here in Harkonnen uniform?" 
    "Quite likely."
    "The Emperor will put a Harkonnen back in power here," Paul said. "Perhaps even Beast Rabban. Let him. Once he has involved himself beyond escaping his guilt, let the Emperor face the possibility of a Bill of Particulars laid before the Landsraad. Let him answer there where--" 
    "Paul!" Jessica said.
    "Granted that the Landsraad High Council accepts your case," Kynes said, "there could be only one outcome: general warfare between the Imperium and the Great Houses." 
    "Chaos," Jessica said.
    "But I'd present my case to the Emperor," Paul said, "and give him an alternative to chaos." 
    Jessica spoke in a dry tone: "Blackmail?"
    "One of the tools of statecraft, as you've said yourself," Paul said, and Jessica heard the bitterness in his voice. "The Emperor has no sons, only daughters." 
    "You'd aim for the throne?" Jessica asked.
    "The Emperor will not risk having the Imperium shattered by total war," Paul said. "Planets blasted, disorder everywhere--he'll not risk that." 
    "This is a desperate gamble you propose," Kynes said. 
    "What do the Great Houses of the Landsraad fear most?" Paul asked. "They fear most what is happening here right now on Arrakis--the Sardaukar picking them off one by one. That's why there is a Landsraad. This is the glue of the Great Convention. Only in union do they match the Imperial forces." 
    "But they're--"
    "This is what they fear," Paul said. "Arrakis would become a rallying cry. Each of them would see himself in my father--cut out of the herd and killed." 
    Kynes spoke to Jessica: "Would his plan work?" 
    "I'm no Mentat," Jessica said. 
    "But you are Bene Gesserit."
    She shot a probing stare at him, said: "His plan has good points and bad points . . . as any plan would at this stage. A plan depends as much upon execution as it does upon concept." 
    " 'Law is the ultimate science,' " Paul quoted. "Thus it reads above the Emperor's door. I propose to show him law." 
    "And I'm not sure I could trust the person who conceived this plan," Kynes said. "Arrakis has its own plan that we--" 
    "From the throne," Paul said, "I could make a paradise of Arrakis with the wave of a hand. This is the coin I offer for your support." 
    Kynes stiffened. "My loyalty's not for sale, Sire." 
    Paul stared across the desk at him, meeting the cold glare of those blue-within-blue eyes, studying the bearded face, the commanding appearance. A harsh smile touched Paul's lips and he said: "Well spoken. I apologize."
    Kynes met Paul's stare and, presently, said: "No Harkonnen ever admitted error. Perhaps you're not like them, Atreides." 
    "It could be a fault in their education," Paul said. "You say you're not for sale, but I believe I've the coin you'll accept. For your loyalty I offer my loyalty to you . . . totally." 
    My son has the Atreides sincerity, Jessica thought. He has that tremendous, almost naive honor--and what a powerful force that truly is. 
    She saw that Paul's words had shaken Kynes.
    "This is nonsense," Kynes said. "You're just a boy and--" 
    "I'm the Duke," Paul said. "I'm an Atreides. No Atreides has ever broken such a bond." 
    Kynes swallowed.
    "When I say totally," Paul said, "I mean without reservation. I would give my life for you."
    "Sire!" Kynes said, and the word was torn from him, but Jessica saw that he was not now speaking to a boy of fifteen, but to a man, to a superior. Now Kynes meant the word.
    In this moment he'd give his life for Paul, she thought. How do the Atreides accomplish this thing so quickly, so easily? 
    "I know you mean this," Kynes said. "Yet the Harkon--" 
    The door behind Paul slammed open. He whirled to see reeling violence--shouting, the clash of steel, wax-image faces grimacing in the passage.
    With his mother beside him, Paul leaped for the door, seeing Idaho blocking the passage, his blood-pitted eyes there visible through a shield blur, claw hands beyond him, arcs of steel chopping futilely at the shield. There was the orange fire-mouth of a stunner repelled by the shield. Idaho's blades were through it all, flick-flicking, red dripping from them.
    Then Kynes was beside Paul and they threw their weight against the door.
    Paul had one last glimpse of Idaho standing against a swarm of Harkonnen uniforms--his jerking, controlled staggers, the black goat hair with a red blossom of death in it. Then the door was closed and there came a snick as Kynes threw the bolts. 
    "I appear to've decided," Kynes said.
    "Someone detected your machinery before it was shut down," Paul said. He pulled his mother away from the door, met the despair in her eyes.
    "I should've suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive," Kynes said.
    "You've a bolt hole out of here," Paul said. "Shall we use it?" 
    Kynes took a deep breath, said: "This door should hold for at least twenty minutes against all but a lasgun."
    "They'll not use a lasgun for fear we've shields on this side," Paul said.
    "Those were Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniform," Jessica whispered.
    They could hear pounding on the door now, rhythmic blows.
    Kynes indicated the cabinets against the right-hand wall, said: "This way." He crossed to the first cabinet, opened a drawer, manipulated a handle within it. The entire wall of cabinets swung open to expose the black mouth of a tunnel. "This door also is plasteel," Kynes said.
    "You were well prepared," Jessica said.
    "We lived under the Harkonnens for eighty years," Kynes said. He herded them into the darkness, closed the door.
    In the sudden blackness, Jessica saw a luminous arrow on the floor ahead of her.
    Kynes' voice came from behind them: "We'll separate here. This wall is tougher. It'll stand for at least an hour. Follow the arrows like that one on the floor. They'll be extinguished by your passage. They lead through a maze to another exit where I've secreted a 'thopter. There's a storm across the desert tonight. Your only hope is to run for that storm, dive into the top of it, ride with it. My people have done this in stealing 'thopters. If you stay high in the storm you'll survive." 
    "What of you?" Paul asked.
    "I'll try to escape another way. If I'm captured . . . well, I'm still Imperial Planetologist. I can say I was your captive." 
    Running like cowards, Paul thought. But how else can I live to avenge my father? He turned to face the door.
    Jessica heard him move, said "Duncan's dead, Paul. You saw the wound. You can do nothing for him." 
    "I'll take full payment for them all one day," Paul said. 
    "Not unless you hurry now," Kynes said. 
    Paul felt the man's hand on his shoulder. 
    "Where will we meet, Kynes?" Paul asked.
    "I'll send Fremen searching for you. The storm's path is known. Hurry now, and the Great Mother give you speed and luck." 
    They heard him go, a scrambling in the blackness.
    Jessica found Paul's hand, pulled him gently. "We must not get separated," she said. 
    "Yes."
    He followed her across the first arrow, seeing it go black as they touched it. Another arrow beckoned ahead.
    They crossed it, saw it extinguish itself, saw another arrow ahead.
    They were running now.
    Plans within plans within plans within plans, Jessica thought. Have we become part of someone else's plan now?
    The arrows led them around turnings, past side openings only dimly sensed in the faint luminescence. Their way slanted downward for a time, then up, ever up. They came finally to steps, rounded a corner and were brought short by a glowing wall with a dark handle visible in its center. 
    Paul pressed the handle.
    The wall swung away from them. Light flared to reveal a rock-hewn cavern with an ornithopter squatting in its center. A flat gray wall with a doorsign on it loomed beyond the aircraft. 
    "Where did Kynes go?" Jessica asked.
    "He did what any good guerrilla leader would," Paul said. "He separated us into two parties and arranged that he couldn't reveal where we are if he's captured. He won't really know." 
    Paul drew her into the room, noting how their feet kicked up dust on the floor.
    "No one's been here for a long time," he said. 
    "He seemed confident the Fremen could find us," she said. 
    "I share that confidence."
    Paul released her hand, crossed to the ornithopter's left door, opened it, and secured his pack in the rear. "This ship's proximity masked," he said. "Instrument panel has remote door control, light control. Eighty years under the Harkonnens taught them to be thorough." 
    Jessica leaned against the craft's other side, catching her breath.
    "The Harkonnens will have a covering force over this area," she said. "They're not stupid." She considered her direction sense, pointed right. "The storm we saw is that way."
    Paul nodded, fighting an abrupt reluctance to move. He knew its cause, but found no help in the knowledge. Somewhere this night he had passed a decision-nexus into the deep unknown. He knew the time-area surrounding them, but the here-and-now existed as a place of mystery. It was as though he had seen himself from a distance go out of sight down into a valley. Of the countless paths up out of that valley, some might carry a Paul Atreides back into sight, but many would not.
    "The longer we wait the better prepared they'll be," Jessica said. 
    "Get in and strap yourself down," he said.
    He joined her in the ornithopter, still wrestling with the thought that this was blind ground, unseen in any prescient vision. And he realized with an abrupt sense of shock that he had been giving more and more reliance to prescient memory and it had weakened him for this particular emergency.
    "If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken." It was a Bene Gesserit axiom. He took it to himself now, promising never again to fall into that trap . . . if he lived through this.
    Paul fastened his safety harness, saw that his mother was secure, checked the aircraft. The wings were at full spread-rest, their delicate metal interleavings extended. He touched the retractor bar, watched the wings shorten for jet-boost take-off the way Gurney Halleck had taught him. The starter switch moved easily. Dials on the instrument panel came alive as the jetpods were armed. Turbines began their low hissing. 
    "Ready?" he asked. 
    "Yes."
    He touched the remote control for lights. 
    Darkness blanketed them.
    His hand was a shadow against the luminous dials as he tripped the remote door control. Grating sounded ahead of them. A cascade of sand swished away to silence. A dusty breeze touched Paul's cheeks. He closed his door, feeling the sudden pressure.
    A wide patch of dust-blurred stars framed in angular darkness appeared where the door-wall had been. Starlight defined a shelf beyond, a suggestion of sand ripples.
    Paul depressed the glowing action-sequence switch on his panel. The wings snapped back and down, hurling the 'thopter out of its nest. Power surged from the jetpods as the wings locked into lift attitude.
    Jessica let her hands ride lightly on the dual controls, feeling the sureness of her son's movements. She was frightened, yet exhilarated. Now, Paul's training is our only hope, she thought. His youth and swiftness.
    Paul fed more power to the jetpods. The 'thopter banked, sinking them into their seats as a dark wall lifted against the stars ahead. He gave the craft more wing, more power. Another burst of lifting wingbeats and they came out over rocks, silver-frosted angles and outcroppings in the starlight. The dust-reddened second moon showed itself above the horizon to their right, defining the ribbon trail of the storm.
    Paul's hands danced over the controls. Wings snicked in to beetle stubs. G-force pulled at their flesh as the craft came around in a tight bank.
    "Jetflares behind us!" Jessica said. 
    "I saw them." 
    He slammed the power arm forward.
    Their 'thopter leaped like a frightened animal, surged southwest toward the storm and the great curve of desert. In the near distance, Paul saw scattered shadows telling where the line of rocks ended, the basement complex sinking beneath the dunes. Beyond stretched moonlit fingernail shadows--dunes diminishing one into another.
    And above the horizon climbed the flat immensity of the storm like a wall against the stars. 
    Something jarred the 'thopter.
    "Shellburst!" Jessica gasped. "They're using some kind of projectile weapon."
    She saw a sudden animal grin on Paul's face. "They seem to be avoiding their lasguns," he said.
    "But we've no shields!"
    "Do they know that?" 
    Again the 'thopter shuddered.
    Paul twisted to peer back. "Only one of them appears to be fast enough to keep up with us."
    He returned his attention to their course, watching the storm wall grow high in front of them. It loomed like a tangible solid.
    "Projectile launchers, rockets, all the ancient weaponry--that's one thing we'll give the Fremen," Paul whispered. 
    "The storm," Jessica said. "Hadn't you better turn?" 
    "What about the ship behind us?" 
    "He's pulling up." 
    "Now!"
    Paul stubbed the wings, banked hard left into the deceptively slow boiling of the storm wall, felt his cheeks pull in the G-force.
    They appeared to glide into a slow clouding of dust that grew heavier and heavier until it blotted out the desert and the moon. The aircraft became a long, horizontal whisper of darkness lighted only by the green luminosity of the instrument panel.
    Through Jessica's mind flashed all the warnings about such storms--that they cut metal like butter, etched flesh to bone and ate away the bones. She felt the buffeting of dust-blanketed wind. It twisted them as Paul fought the controls. She saw him chop the power, felt the ship buck. The metal around them hissed and trembled.
    "Sand!" Jessica shouted.
    She saw the negative shake of his head in the light from the panel. "Not much sand this high." 
    But she could feel them sinking deeper into the maelstrom.
    Paul sent the wings to their full soaring length, heard them creak with the strain. He kept his eyes fixed on the instruments, gliding by instinct, fighting for altitude.
    The sound of their passage diminished.
    The 'thopter began rolling off to the left. Paul focused on the glowing globe within the attitude curve, fought his craft back to level flight.
    Jessica had the eerie feeling that they were standing still, that all motion was external. A vague tan flowing against the windows, a rumbling hiss reminded her of the powers around them.
    Winds to seven or eight hundred kilometers an hour, she thought. Adrenaline edginess gnawed at her. I must not fear, she told herself, mouthing the words of the Bene Gesserit litany. Fear is the mind-killer.
    Slowly her long years of training prevailed.
    Calmness returned.
    "We have the tiger by the tail," Paul whispered. "We can't go down, can't land . . . and I don't think I can lift us out of this. We'll have to ride it out."
    Calmness drained out of her. Jessica felt her teeth chattering, clamped them together. Then she heard Paul's voice, low and controlled, reciting the litany:
    "Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear's path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."

What do you despise? By this are you truly known.
-from "Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    "They are dead, Baron," said Iakin Nefud, the guard captain. "Both the woman and the boy are certainly dead." 
    The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sat up in the sleep suspensors of his private quarters. Beyond these quarters and enclosing him like a multishelled egg stretched the space frigate he had grounded on Arrakis. Here in his quarters, though, the ship's harsh metal was disguised with draperies, with fabric paddings and rare art objects. 
    "It is a certainty," the guard captain said. "They are dead." 
    The Baron shifted his gross body in the suspensors, focused his attention on an ebaline statue of a leaping boy in a niche across the room. Sleep faded from him. He straightened the padded suspensor beneath the fat folds of his neck, stared across the single glowglobe of his bedchamber to the doorway where Captain Nefud stood blocked by the pentashield.
    "They're certainly dead, Baron," the man repeated.
    The Baron noted the trace of semuta dullness in Nefud's eyes. It was obvious the man had been deep within the drug's rapture when he received this report, and had stopped only to take the antidote before rushing here.
    "I have a full report," Nefud said.
    Let him sweat a little, the Baron thought. One must always keep the tools of statecraft sharp and ready. Power and fear--sharp and ready.
    "Have you seen their bodies?" the Baron rumbled. 
    Nefud hesitated. 
    "Well?"
    "M'Lord . . . they were seen to dive into a sandstorm . . . winds over eight hundred kilometers. Nothing survives such a storm, m'Lord. Nothing! One of our own craft was destroyed in the pursuit."
    The Baron stared at Nefud, noting the nervous twitch in the scissors line of the man's jaw muscles, the way the chin moved as Nefud swallowed.
    "You have seen the bodies?" the Baron asked. 
    "M'Lord--"
    "For what purpose do you come here rattling your armor?" the Baron roared. "To tell me a thing is certain when it is not? Do you think I'll praise you for such stupidity, give you another promotion?" 
    Nefud's face went bone pale.
    Look at the chicken, the Baron thought. I am surrounded by such useless clods. If I scattered sand before this creature and told him it was grain, he'd peek at it.
    "The man Idaho led us to them, then?" the Baron asked. 
    "Yes, m'Lord!"
    Look how he blurts out his answer, the Baron thought. He said: "They were attempting to flee to the Fremen, eh?" 
    "Yes, m'Lord." 
    "Is there more to this . . . report?"
    "The Imperial Planetologist, Kynes, is involved, m'Lord. Idaho joined this Kynes under mysterious circumstances . . . I might even say suspicious circumstances." 
    "So?"
    "They . . . ah, fled together to a place in the desert where it's apparent the boy and his mother were hiding. In the excitement of the chase, several of our groups were caught in a lasgun-shield explosion." 
    "How many did we lose?" 
    "I'm . . . ah, not sure yet, m'Lord." 
    He's lying, the Baron thought. It must've been pretty bad.
    "The Imperial lackey, this Kynes," the Baron said. "He was playing a double game, eh?" 
    "I'd stake my reputation on it, m'Lord." 
    His reputation!
    "Have the man killed," the Baron said.
    "M'Lord! Kynes is the Imperial Planetologist, His Majesty's own serv--" 
    "Make it look like an accident, then!"
    "M'Lord, there were Sardaukar with our forces in the subjugation of this Fremen nest. They have Kynes in custody now." 
    "Get him away from them. Say I wish to question him." 
    "If they demur?" 
    "They will not if you handle it correctly." 
    Nefud swallowed. "Yes, m'Lord."
    "The man must die," the Baron rumbled. "He tried to help my enemies." 
    Nefud shifted from one foot to the other. 
    "Well?"
    "M'Lord, the Sardaukar have . . . two persons in custody who might be of interest to you. They've caught the Duke's Master of Assassins." 
    "Hawat? Thufir Hawat?" 
    "I've seen the captive myself, m'Lord. 'Tis Hawat." 
    "I'd not've believed it possible!"
    "They say he was knocked out by a stunner, m'Lord. In the desert where he couldn't use his shield. He's virtually unharmed. If we can get our hands on him, he'll provide great sport." 
    "This is a Mentat you speak of," the Baron growled. "One doesn't waste a Mentat. Has he spoken? What does he say of his defeat? Could he know the extent of . . . but no." 
    "He has spoken only enough, m'Lord, to reveal his belief that the Lady Jessica was his betrayer." 
    "Ah-h-h-h-h."
    The Baron sank back, thinking; then: "You're sure? It's the Lady Jessica who attracts his anger?" 
    "He said it in my presence, m'Lord." 
    "Let him think she's alive, then." 
    "But, m'Lord--"
    "Be quiet. I wish Hawat treated kindly. He must be told nothing of the late Doctor Yueh, his true betrayer. Let it be said that Doctor Yueh died defending his Duke. In a way, this may even be true. We will, instead, feed his suspicions against the Lady Jessica." 
    "M'Lord, I don't--"
    "The way to control and direct a Mentat, Nefud, is through his information. False information--false results." 
    "Yes, m'Lord, but . . . "
    "Is Hawat hungry? Thirsty?" 
    "M'Lord, Hawat's still in the hands of the Sardaukar!" 
    "Yes. Indeed, yes. But the Sardaukar will be as anxious to get information from Hawat as I am. I've noticed a thing about our allies, Nefud. They're not very devious . . .politically. I do believe this is a deliberate thing; the Emperor wants it that way. Yes. I do believe it. You will remind the Sardaukar commander of my renown at obtaining information from reluctant subjects." 
    Nefud looked unhappy. "Yes, m'Lord."
    "You will tell the Sardaukar commander that I wish to question both Hawat and this Kynes at the same time, playing one off against the other. He can understand that much, I think." 
    "Yes, m'Lord." 
    "And once we have them in our hands . . . " The Baron nodded.
    "M'Lord, the Sardaukar will want an observer with you during any . . . questioning."
    "I'm sure we can produce an emergency to draw off any unwanted observers, Nefud."
    "I understand, m'Lord. That's when Kynes can have his accident."
    "Both Kynes and Hawat will have accidents then, Nefud. But only Kynes will have a real accident. It's Hawat I want. Yes. Ah, yes."
    Nefud blinked, swallowed. He appeared about to ask a question, but remained silent.
    "Hawat will be given both food and drink," the Baron said. "Treated with kindness, with sympathy. In his water you will administer the residual poison developed by the late Piter de Vries. And you will see that the antidote becomes a regular part of Hawat's diet from this point on . . . unless I say otherwise." 
    "The antidote, yes." Nefud shook his head. "But--" 
    "Don't be dense, Nefud. The Duke almost killed me with that poison-capsule tooth. The gas he exhaled into my presence deprived me of my most valuable Mentat, Piter. I need a replacement." 
    "Hawat?" 
    "Hawat." 
    "But--"
    "You're going to say Hawat's completely loyal to the Atreides. True, but the Atreides are dead. We will woo him. He must be convinced he's not to blame for the Duke's demise. It was all the doing of that Bene Gesserit witch. He had an inferior master, one whose reason was clouded by emotion. Mentats admire the ability to calculate without emotion, Nefud. We will woo the formidable Thufir Hawat." 
    "Woo him. Yes, m'Lord."
    "Hawat, unfortunately, had a master whose resources were poor, one who could not elevate a Mentat to the sublime peaks of reasoning that are a Mentat's right. Hawat will see a certain element of truth in this. The Duke couldn't afford the most efficient spies to provide his Mentat with the required information." The Baron stared at Nefud. "Let us never deceive ourselves, Nefud. The truth is a powerful weapon. We know how we overwhelmed the Atreides. Hawat knows, too. We did it with wealth." 
    "With wealth. Yes, m'Lord."
    "We will woo Hawat," the Baron said. "We will hide him from the Sardaukar. And we will hold in reserve . . . the withdrawal of the antidote for the poison. There's no way of removing the residual poison. And, Nefud, Hawat need never suspect. The antidote will not betray itself to a poison snooper. Hawat can scan his food as he pleases and detect no trace of poison." 
    Nefud's eyes opened wide with understanding.
    "The absence of a thing," the Baron said, "this can be as deadly as the presence. The absence of air, eh? The absence of water? The absence of anything else we're addicted to." The Baron nodded. "You understand me, Nefud?" 
    Nefud swallowed. "Yes, m'Lord."
    Then get busy. Find the Sardaukar commander and set things in motion." 
    "At once, m'Lord." Nefud bowed, turned, and hurried away.
    Hawat by my side! the Baron thought. The Sardaukar will give him to me. If they suspect anything at all it's that I wish to destroy the Mentat. And this suspicion I'll confirm! The fools! One of the most formidable Mentats in all history, a Mentat trained to kill, and they'll toss him to me like some silly toy to be broken. I will show them what use can be made of such a toy.
    The Baron reached beneath a drapery beside his suspensor bed, pressed a button to summon his older nephew, Rabban. He sat back, smiling.
    And all the Atreides dead!
    The stupid guard captain had been right, of course. Certainly, nothing survived in the path of a sandblast storm on Arrakis. Not an ornithopter . . . or its occupants. The woman and the boy were dead. The bribes in the right places, the unthinkable expenditure to bring overwhelming military force down onto one planet . . . all the sly reports tailored for the Emperor's ears alone, all the careful scheming were here at last coming to full fruition. 
    Power and fear--fear and power!
    The Baron could see the path ahead of him. One day, a Harkonnen would be Emperor. Not himself, and no spawn of his loins. But a Harkonnen. Not this Rabban he'd summoned, of course. But Rabban's younger brother, young Feyd-Rautha. There was a sharpness to the boy that the Baron enjoyed . . . a ferocity.
    A lovely boy, the Baron thought. A year or two more--say, by the time he's seventeen, I'll know for certain whether he's the tool that House Harkonnen requires to gain the throne. 
    "M'Lord Baron."
    The man who stood outside the doorfield of the Baron's bedchamber was low built, gross of face and body, with the Harkonnen paternal line's narrow-set eyes and bulge of shoulders. There was yet some rigidity in his fat, but it was obvious to the eye that he'd come one day to the portable suspensors for carrying his excess weight.
    A muscle-minded tank-brain, the Baron thought. No Mentat, my nephew . . . not a Piter de Vries, but perhaps something more precisely devised for the task at hand. If I give him freedom to do it, he'll grind over everything in his path. Oh, how he'll be hated here on Arrakis!
    "My dear Rabban," the Baron said. He released the doorfield, but pointedly kept his body shield at full strength, knowing that the shimmer of it would be visible above the bedside glowglobe.
    "You summoned me," Rabban said. He stepped into the room, flicked a glance past the air disturbance of the body shield, searched for a suspensor chair, found none.
    "Stand closer where I can see you easily," the Baron said.
    Rabban advanced another step, thinking that the damnable old man had deliberately removed all chairs, forcing a visitor to stand.
    "The Atreides are dead," the Baron said. "The last of them. That's why I summoned you here to Arrakis. This planet is again yours."
    Rabban blinked. "But I thought you were going to advance Piter de Vries to the--" 
    "Piter, too, is dead." 
    "Piter?" 
    "Piter."
    The Baron reactivated the doorfield, blanked it against all energy penetration.
    "You finally tired of him, eh?" Rabban asked.
    His voice fell flat and lifeless in the energy-blanketed room.
    "I will say a thing to you just this once," the Baron rumbled. "You insinuate that I obliterated Piter as one obliterates a trifle." He snapped fat fingers. "Just like that, eh? I am not so stupid, Nephew. I will take it unkindly if ever again you suggest by word or action that I am so stupid."
    Fear showed in the squinting of Rabban's eyes. He knew within certain limits how far the old Baron would go against family. Seldom to the point of death unless there were outrageous profit or provocation in it. But family punishments could be painful.
    "Forgive me, m'Lord Baron," Rabban said. He lowered his eyes as much to hide his own anger as to show subservience. 
    "You do not fool me, Rabban," the Baron said. 
    Rabban kept his eyes lowered, swallowed.
    "I make a point," the Baron said. "Never obliterate a man unthinkingly, the way an entire fief might do it through some due process of law. Always do it for an overriding purpose--and know your purpose!"
    Anger spoke in Rabban: "But you obliterated the traitor, Yueh! I saw his body being carried out as I arrived last night." 
    Rabban stared at his uncle, suddenly frightened by the sound of those words.
    But the Baron smiled. "I'm very careful about dangerous weapons," he said. "Doctor Yueh was a traitor. He gave me the Duke." Strength poured into the Baron's voice. "I suborned a doctor of the Suk School! The Inner School! You hear, boy? But that's a wild sort of weapon to leave lying about. I didn't obliterate him casually." 
    "Does the Emperor know you suborned a Suk doctor?" 
    This was a penetrating question, the Baron thought. Have I misjudged this nephew?
    "The Emperor doesn't know it yet," the Baron said. "But his Sardaukar are sure to report it to him. Before that happens, though, I'll have my own report in his hands through CHOAM Company channels. I will explain that I luckily discovered a doctor who pretended to the conditioning. A false doctor, you understand? Since everyone knows you cannot counter the conditioning of a Suk School, this will be accepted." 
    "Ah-h-h, I see," Rabban murmured.
    And the Baron thought: Indeed, I hope you do see. I hope you do see how vital it is that this remain secret. The Baron suddenly wondered at himself. Why did I do that? Why did I boast to this fool nephew of mine--the nephew I must use and discard? The Baron felt anger at himself. He felt betrayed.
    "It must be kept secret," Rabban said. "I understand." 
    The Baron sighed. "I give you different instructions about Arrakis this time, Nephew. When last you ruled this place, I held you in strong rein. This time, I have only one requirement." 
    "M'Lord?" 
    "Income." 
    "Income?"
    "Have you any idea, Rabban, how much we spent to bring such military force to bear on the Atreides? Do you have even the first inkling of how much the Guild charges for military transport?" 
    "Expensive, eh?" 
    "Expensive!"
    The Baron shot a fat arm toward Rabban. "If you squeeze Arrakis for every cent it can give us for sixty years, you'll just barely repay us!" 
    Rabban opened his mouth, closed it without speaking.
    "Expensive," the Baron sneered. "The damnable Guild monopoly on space would've ruined us if I hadn't planned for this expense long ago. You should know, Rabban, that we bore the entire brunt of it. We even paid for transport of the Sardaukar." 
    And not for the first time, the Baron wondered if there ever would come a day when the Guild might be circumvented. They were insidious--bleeding off just enough to keep the host from objecting until they had you in their fist where they could force you to pay and pay and pay.
    Always, the exorbitant demands rode upon military ventures. "Hazard rates," the oily Guild agents explained. And for every agent you managed to insert as a watchdog in the Guild Bank structure, they put two agents into your system. 
    Insufferable!
    "Income then," Rabban said.
    The Baron lowered his arm, made a fist. "You must squeeze." 
    "And I may do anything I wish as long as I squeeze?" 
    "Anything." 
    "The cannons you brought," Rabban said. "Could I--" 
    "I'm removing them," the Baron said. 
    "But you--"
    "You won't need such toys. They were a special innovation and are now useless. We need the metal. They cannot go against a shield, Rabban. They were merely the unexpected. It was predictable that the Duke's men would retreat into cliff caves on this abominable planet. Our cannon merely sealed them in."
    "The Fremen don't use shields." 
    "You may keep some lasguns if you wish." 
    "Yes, m 'Lord. And I have a free hand." 
    "As long as you squeeze." 
    Rabban's smile was gloating. "I understand perfectly, m'Lord." 
    "You understand nothing perfectly," the Baron growled. "Let us have that clear at the outset. What you do understand is how to carry out my orders. Has it occurred to you, nephew, that there are at least five million persons on this planet?"
    "Does m'Lord forget that I was his regent-siridar here before? And if m'Lord will forgive me, his estimate may be low. It's difficult to count a population scattered among sinks and pans the way they are here. And when you consider the Fremen of--" 
    "The Fremen aren't worth considering!" 
    "Forgive me, m'Lord, but the Sardaukar believe otherwise." 
    The Baron hesitated, staring at his nephew. "You know something?"
    "M'Lord had retired when I arrived last night. I . . . ah, took the liberty of contacting some of my lieutenants from . . . ah, before. They've been acting as guides to the Sardaukar. They report that a Fremen band ambushed a Sardaukar force somewhere southeast of here and wiped it out." 
    "Wiped out a Sardaukar force?" 
    "Yes, m'Lord." 
    "Impossible!" 
    Rabban shrugged.
    "Fremen defeating Sardaukar," the Baron sneered.
    "I repeat only what was reported to me," Rabban said. "It is said this Fremen force already had captured the Duke's redoubtable Thufir Hawat." 
    "Ah-h-h-h-h-h." 
    The Baron nodded, smiling.
    "I believe the report," Rabban said. "You've no idea what a problem the Fremen were."
    "Perhaps, but these weren't Fremen your lieutenants saw. They must've been Atreides men trained by Hawat and disguised as Fremen. It's the only possible answer."
    Again, Rabban shrugged. "Well, the Sardaukar think they were Fremen. The Sardaukar already have launched a program to wipe out all Fremen." 
    "Good!" 
    "But--" 
    "It'll keep the Sardaukar occupied. And we'll soon have Hawat. I know it! I can feel it! Ah, this has been a day! The Sardaukar off hunting a few useless desert bands while we get the real prize!" 
    "M'Lord . . . " Rabban hesitated, frowning. "I've always felt that we underestimated the Fremen, both in numbers and in--" 
    "Ignore them, boy! They're rabble. It's the populous towns, cities, and villages that concern us. A great many people there, eh?" 
    "A great many, m'Lord." 
    "They worry me, Rabban." 
    "Worry you?"
    "Oh . . . ninety per cent of them are of no concern. But there are always a few . . . Houses Minor and so on, people of ambition who might try a dangerous thing. If one of them should get off Arrakis with an unpleasant story about what happened here, I'd be most displeased. Have you any idea how displeased I'd be?" 
    Rabban swallowed.
    "You must take immediate measures to hold a hostage from each House Minor," the Baron said. "As far as anyone off Arrakis must learn, this was straightforward House-to-House battle. The Sardaukar had no part in it, you understand? The Duke was offered the usual quarter and exile, but he died in an unfortunate accident before he could accept. He was about to accept, though. That is the story. And any rumor that there were Sardaukar here, it must be laughed at." 
    "As the Emperor wishes it," Rabban said. 
    "As the Emperor wishes it." 
    "What about the smugglers?"
    "No one believes smugglers, Rabban. They are tolerated, but not believed. At any rate, you'll be spreading some bribes in that quarter . . . and taking other measures which I'm sure you can think of." 
    "Yes, m'Lord."
    "Two things from Arrakis, then, Rabban: income and a merciless fist. You must show no mercy here. Think of these clods as what they are--slaves envious of their masters and waiting only the opportunity to rebel. Not the slightest vestige of pity or mercy must you show them." 
    "Can one exterminate an entire planet?" Rabban asked.
    "Exterminate?" Surprise showed in the swift turning of the Baron's head. "Who said anything about exterminating?" 
    "Well, I presumed you were going to bring in new stock and--" 
    "I said squeeze. Nephew, not exterminate. Don't waste the population, merely drive them into utter submission. You must be the carnivore, my boy." He smiled, a baby's expression in the dimple-fat face. "A carnivore never stops. Show no mercy. Never stop. Mercy is a chimera. It can be defeated by the stomach rumbling its hunger, by the throat crying its thirst. You must be always hungry and thirsty." The Baron caressed his bulges beneath the suspensors. "Like me." 
    "I see, m'Lord." 
    Rabban swung his gaze left and right. 
    "It's all clear then, Nephew?" 
    "Except for one thing. Uncle: the planetologist, Kynes." 
    "Ah, yes, Kynes."
    "He's the Emperor's man, m'Lord. He can come and go as he pleases. And he's very close to the Fremen . . . married one." 
    "Kynes will be dead by tomorrow's nightfall." 
    "That's dangerous work, Uncle, killing an Imperial servant." 
    "How do you think I've come this far this quickly?" the Baron demanded. His voice was low, charged with unspeakable adjectives. "Besides, you need never have feared Kynes would leave Arrakis. You're forgetting that he's addicted to the spice." 
    "Of course!"
    "Those who know will do nothing to endanger their supply," the Baron said. "Kynes certainly must know." 
    "I forgot, "Rabban said.
    They stared at each other in silence.
    Presently, the Baron said: "Incidentally, you will make my own supply one of your first concerns. I've quite a stockpile of private stuff, but that suicide raid by the Duke's men got most of what we'd stored for sale." 
    Rabban nodded. "Yes, m'Lord."
    The Baron brightened. "Now, tomorrow morning, you will assemble what remains of organization here and you'll say to them: 'Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.' " 
    "I understand, m'Lord."
    "This time, I'm sure you do. We will discuss it in more detail tomorrow. Now, leave me to finish my sleep."
    The Baron deactivated his doorfield, watched his nephew out of sight.
    A tank-brain, the Baron thought. Muscle-minded tank-brain. They will be bloody pulp here when he's through with them. Then, when I send in Feyd-Rautha to take the load off them, they'll cheer their rescuer. Beloved Feyd-Rautha. Benign Feyd-Rautha, the compassionate one who saves them from a beast. Feyd-Rautha, a man to follow and die for. The boy will know by that time how to oppress with impunity. I'm sure he's the one we need. He'll learn. And such a lovely body. Really a lovely boy.

-from "A Child's History of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    As Paul fought the 'thopter's controls, he grew aware that he was sorting out the interwoven storm forces, his more than Mentat awareness computing on the basis of fractional minutiae. He felt dust fronts, billowings, mixings of turbulence, an occasional vortex.
    The cabin interior was an angry box lighted by the green radiance of instrument dials. The tan flow of dust outside appeared featureless, but his inner sense began to see through the curtain. 
    I must find the right vortex, he thought.
    For a long time now he had sensed the storm's power diminishing, but still it shook them. He waited out another turbulence.
    The vortex began as an abrupt billowing that rattled the entire ship. Paul defied all fear to bank the 'thopter left. 
    Jessica saw the maneuver on the attitude globe. 
    "Paul!" she screamed.
    The vortex turned them, twisting, tipping. It lifted the 'thopter like a chip on a geyser, spewed them up and out--a winged speck within a core of winding dust lighted by the second moon.
    Paul looked down, saw the dust-defined pillar of hot wind that had disgorged them, saw the dying storm trailing away like a dry river into the desert--moon-gray motion growing smaller and smaller below as they rode the updraft. 
    "We're out of it," Jessica whispered.
    Paul turned their craft away from the dust in swooping rhythm while he scanned the night sky.
    "We've given them the slip," he said.
    Jessica felt her heart pounding. She forced herself to calmness, looked at the diminishing storm. Her time sense said they had ridden within that compounding of elemental forces almost four hours, but part of her mind computed the passage as a lifetime. She felt reborn.
    It was like the litany, she thought. We faced it and did not resist. The storm passed through us and around us. It's gone, but we remain.
    "I don't like the sound of our wing motion," Paul said. "We suffered some damage in there."
    He felt the grating, injured flight through his hands on the controls. They were out of the storm, but still not out into the full view of his prescient vision. Yet, they had escaped, and Paul sensed himself trembling on the verge of a revelation. 
    He shivered.
    The sensation was magnetic and terrifying, and he found himself caught on the question of what caused this trembling awareness. Part of it, he felt, was the spice-saturated diet of Arrakis. But he thought part of it could be the litany, as though the words had a power of their own.
    "I shall not fear . . . "
    Cause and effect: he was alive despite malignant forces, and he felt himself poised on a brink of self-awareness that could not have been without the litany's magic.
    Words from the Orange Catholic Bible rang through his memory: "What senses do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?"
    "There's rock all around," Jessica said.
    Paul focused on the 'thopter's launching, shook his head to clear it. He looked where his mother pointed, saw uplifting rock shapes black on the sand ahead and to the right. He felt wind around his ankles, a stirring of dust in the cabin. There was a hole somewhere, more of the storm's doing.
    "Better set us down on sand," Jessica said. "The wings might not take full brake."
    He nodded toward a place ahead where sandblasted ridges lifted into moonlight above the dunes. "I'll set us down near those rocks. Check your safety harness."
    She obeyed, thinking: We've water and stillsuits. If we can find food, we can survive a long time on this desert. Fremen live here. What they can do we can do.
    "Run for those rocks the instant we're stopped," Paul said. "I'll take the pack." 
    "Run for . . . " She fell silent, nodded. "Worms." 
    "Our friends, the worms," he corrected her. "They'll get this 'thopter. There'll be no evidence of where we landed."
    How direct his thinking, she thought.
    They glided lower . . . lower . . . 
    There came a rushing sense of motion to their passage--blurred shadows of dunes, rocks lifting like islands. The 'thopter touched a dune top with a soft lurch, skipped a sand valley, touched another dune.
    He's killing our speed against the sand, Jessica thought, and permitted herself to admire his competence. 
    "Brace yourself!" Paul warned.
    He pulled back on the wing brakes, gently at first, then harder and harder. He felt them cup the air, their aspect ratio dropping faster and faster. Wind screamed through the lapped coverts and primaries of the wings' leaves.
    Abruptly, with only the faintest lurch of warning, the left wing, weakened by the storm, twisted upward and in, slamming across the side of the 'thopter. The craft skidded across a dune top, twisting to the left. It tumbled down the opposite face to bury its nose in the next dune amid a cascade of sand. They lay stopped on the broken wing side, the right wing pointing toward the stars.
    Paul jerked off his safety harness, hurled himself upward across his mother, wrenching the door open. Sand poured around them into the cabin, bringing a dry smell of burned flint. He grabbed the pack from the rear, saw that his mother was free of her harness. She stepped up onto the side of the right-hand seat and out onto the 'thopter's metal skin. Paul followed, dragging the pack by its straps.
    "Run!" he ordered.
    He pointed up the dune face and beyond it where they could see a rock tower undercut by sandblast winds.
    Jessica leaped off the 'thopter and ran, scrambling and sliding up the dune. She heard Paul's panting progress behind. They came out onto a sand ridge that curved away toward the rocks. 
    "Follow the ridge," Paul ordered. "It'll be faster." 
    They slogged toward the rocks, sand gripping their feet.
    A new sound began to impress itself on them: a muted whisper, a hissing, an abrasive slithering. 
    "Worm," Paul said. 
    It grew louder.
    "Faster!" Paul gasped. 
    The first rock shingle, like a beach slanting from the sand, lay no more than ten meters ahead when they heard metal crunch and shatter behind them.
    Paul shifted his pack to his right arm, holding it by the straps. It slapped his side as he ran. He took his mother's arm with his other hand. They scrambled onto the lifting rock, up a pebble-littered surface through a twisted, wind-carved channel. Breath came dry and gasping in their throats.
    "I can't run any farther," Jessica panted.
    Paul stopped, pressed her into a gut of rock, turned and looked down onto the desert. A mound-in-motion ran parallel to their rock island--moonlit ripples, sand waves, a cresting burrow almost level with Paul's eyes at a distance of about a kilometer. The flattened dunes of its track curved once--a short loop crossing the patch of desert where they had abandoned their wrecked ornithopter.
    Where the worm had been there was no sign of the aircraft.
    The burrow mound moved outward into the desert, coursed back across its own path, questing.
    "It's bigger than a Guild spaceship," Paul whispered. "I was told worms grew large in the deep desert, but I didn't realize . . . how big." 
    "Nor I," Jessica breathed.
    Again, the thing turned out away from the rocks, sped now with a curving track toward the horizon. They listened until the sound of its passage was lost in gentle sand stirrings around them. 
    Paul took a deep breath, looked up at the moon-frosted escarpment, and quoted from the Kitab al-Ibar: "Travel by night and rest in black shade through the day." He looked at his mother. "We still have a few hours of night. Can you go on?" 
    "In a moment."
    Paul stepped out onto the rock shingle, shouldered the pack and adjusted its straps. He stood a moment with a paracompass in his hands.
    "Whenever you're ready," he said.
    She pushed herself away from the rock, feeling her strength return. "Which direction?" 
    "Where this ridge leads." He pointed. 
    "Deep into the desert," she said. 
    "The Fremen desert," Paul whispered.
    And he paused, shaken by the remembered high relief imagery of a prescient vision he had experienced on Caladan. He had seen this desert. But the set of the vision had been subtly different, like an optical image that had disappeared into his consciousness, been absorbed by memory, and now failed of perfect registry when projected onto the real scene. The vision appeared to have shifted and approached him from a different angle while he remained motionless.
    Idaho was with us in the vision, he remembered. But now Idaho is dead.
    "Do you see a way to go?" Jessica asked, mistaking his hesitation.
    "No," he said, "But we'll go anyway."
    He settled his shoulders more firmly in the pack, struck out up a sand-carved channel in the rock. The channel opened onto a moonlit floor of rock with benched ledges climbing away to the south.
    Paul headed for the first ledge, clambered onto it. Jessica followed.
    She noted presently how their passage became a matter of the immediate and particular--the sand pockets between rocks where their steps were slowed, the wind-carved ridge that cut their hands, the obstruction that forced a choice: Go over or go around? The terrain enforced its own rhythms. They spoke only when necessary and then with the hoarse voices of their exertion. 
    "Careful here--this ledge is slippery with sand." 
    "Watch you don't hit your head against this overhang." 
    "Stay below this ridge; the moon's at our backs and it'd show our movement to anyone out there."
    Paul stopped in a bight of rock, leaned the pack against a narrow ledge.
    Jessica leaned beside him, thankful for the moment of rest. She heard Paul pulling at his stillsuit tube, sipped her own reclaimed water. It tasted brackish, and she remembered the waters of Caladan--a tall fountain enclosing a curve of sky, such a richness of moisture that it hadn't been noticed for itself . . . only for its shape, or its reflection, or its sound as she stopped beside it. 
    To stop, she thought. To rest . . . truly rest.
    It occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop, if only for a moment. There was no mercy where there could be no stopping.
    Paul pushed away from the rock ledge, turned, and climbed over a sloping surface. Jessica followed with a sigh.
    They slid down onto a wide shelf that led around a sheer rock face. Again, they fell into the disjointed rhythm of movement across this broken land.
    Jessica felt that the night was dominated by degrees of smallness in substances beneath their feet and hands--boulders or pea gravel or flaked rock or pea sand or sand itself or grit or dust or gossamer powder.
    The powder clogged nose filters and had to be blown out. Pea sand and pea gravel rolled on a hard surface and could spill the unwary. Rock flakes cut.
    And the omnipresent sand patches dragged against their feet.
    Paul stopped abruptly on a rock shelf, steadied his mother as she stumbled into him.
    He was pointing left and she looked along his arm to see that they stood atop a cliff with the desert stretched out like a static ocean some two hundred meters below. It lay there full of moon-silvered waves--shadows of angles that lapsed into curves and, in the distance, lifted to the misted gray blur of another escarpment. 
    "Open desert," she said.
    "A wide place to cross," Paul said, and his voice was muffled by the filter trap across his face.
    Jessica glanced left and right--nothing but sand below.
    Paul stared straight ahead across the open dunes, watching the movement of shadows in the moon's passage. "About three or four kilometers across," he said. 
    "Worms," she said. 
    "Sure to be."
    She focused on her weariness, the muscle ache that dulled her senses. "Shall we rest and eat?"
    Paul slipped out of the pack, sat down and leaned against it. Jessica supported herself by a hand on his shoulder as she sank to the rock beside him. She felt Paul turn as she settled herself, heard him scrabbling in the pack. 
    "Here," he said.
    His hand felt dry against hers as he pressed two energy capsules into her palm
    She swallowed them with a grudging spit of water from her stillsuit tube.
    "Drink all your water," Paul said. "Axiom: the best place to conserve your water is in your body. It keeps your energy up. You're stronger. Trust your stillsuit."
    She obeyed, drained her catchpockets, feeling energy return. She thought then how peaceful it was here in this moment of their tiredness, and she recalled once hearing the minstrel-warrior Gurney Halleck say, "Better a dry morsel and quietness therewith than a house full of sacrifice and strife." 
    Jessica repeated the words to Paul. 
    "That was Gurney," he said.
    She caught the tone of his voice, the way he spoke as of someone dead, thought: And well poor Gurney might be dead. The Atreides forces were either dead or captive or lost like themselves in this waterless void.
    "Gurney always had the right quotation," Paul said. "I can hear him now: 'And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked; and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers.' "
    Jessica closed her eyes, found herself moved close to tears by the pathos in her son's voice.
    Presently, Paul said: "How do you . . . feel?" 
    She recognized that his question was directed at her pregnancy, said: "Your sister won't be born for many months yet. I still feel . . . physically adequate."
    And she thought: How stiffly formal I speak to my own son! Then, because it was the Bene Gesserit way to seek within for the answer to such an oddity, she searched and found the source of her formality: I'm afraid of my son; I fear his strangeness; I fear what he may see ahead of us, what he may tell me.
    Paul pulled his hood down over his eyes, listened to the bug-hustling sounds of the night. His lungs were charged with his own silence. His nose itched. He rubbed it, removed the filter and grew conscious of the rich smell of cinnamon.
    "There's melange spice nearby," he said.
    An eider wind feathered Paul's cheeks, ruffled the folds of his burnoose. But this wind carried no threat of storm; already he could sense the difference. 
    "Dawn soon," he said. 
    Jessica nodded.
    "There's a way to get safely across that open sand," Paul said. "The Fremen do it." 
    "The worms?"
    "If we were to plant a thumper from our Fremkit back in the rocks here," Paul said. "It'd keep a worm occupied for a time." 
    She glanced at the stretch of moonlighted desert between them and the other escarpment. "Four kilometers worth of time?" 
    "Perhaps. And if we crossed there making only natural sounds, the kind that don't attract the worms . . . "
    Paul studied the open desert, questing in his prescient memory, probing the mysterious allusions to thumpers and maker hooks in the Fremkit manual that had come with their escape pack. He found it odd that all he sensed was pervasive terror at thought of the worms. He knew as though it lay just at the edge of his awareness that the worms were to be respected and not feared . . . if . . . if . . . 
    He shook his head.
    "It'd have to be sounds without rhythm," Jessica said.
    "What? Oh. Yes. If we broke our steps . . . the sand itself must shift down at times. Worms can't investigate every little sound. We should be fully rested before we try it, though."
    He looked across at that other rock wall, seeing the passage of time in the vertical moonshadows there. "It'll be dawn within the hour." 
    "Where'll we spend the day?" she asked.
    Paul turned left, pointed. "The cliff curves back north over there. You can see by the way it's wind-cut that's the windward face. There'll be crevasses there, deep ones." 
    "Had we better get started?" she asked.
    He stood, helped her to her feet. "Are you rested enough for a climb down? I want to get as close as possible to the desert floor before we camp." 
    "Enough." She nodded for him to lead the way.
    He hesitated, then lifted the pack, settled it onto his shoulders and turned along the cliff.
    If only we had suspensors, Jessica thought. It'd be such a simple matter to jump down there. But perhaps suspensors are another thing to avoid in the open desert. Maybe they attract the worms the way a shield does.
    They came to a series of shelves dropping down and, beyond them, saw a fissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the vestibule.
    Paul led the way down, moving cautiously but hurrying because it was obvious the moonlight could not last much longer. They wound down into a world of deeper and deeper shadows. Hints of rock shape climbed to the stars around them. The fissure narrowed to some ten meters' width at the brink of a dim gray sandslope that slanted downward into darkness.
    "Can we do down?" Jessica whispered. 
    "I think so." 
    He tested the surface with one foot.
    "We can slide down," he said. "I'll go first. Wait until you hear me stop." 
    "Careful," she said.
    He stepped onto the slope and slid and slipped down its soft surface onto an almost level floor of packed sand. The place was deep within the rock walls.
    There came the sound of sand sliding behind him. He tried to see up the slope in the darkness, was almost knocked over by the cascade. It trailed away to silence. 
    "Mother?" he said. 
    There was no answer. 
    "Mother?"
    He dropped the pack, hurled himself up the slope, scrambling, digging, throwing sand like a wild man. "Mother!" he gasped. "Mother, where are you?"
    Another cascade of sand swept down on him, burying him to the hips. He wrenched himself out of it.
    She's been caught in the sandslide, he thought. Buried in it. I must be calm and work this out carefully. She won't smother immediately. She'll compose herself in bindu suspension to reduce her oxygen needs. She knows I'll dig for her.
    In the Bene Gesserit way she had taught him, Paul stilled the savage beating of his heart, set his mind as a blank slate upon which the past few moments could write themselves. Every partial shift and twist of the slide replayed itself in his memory, moving with an interior stateliness that contrasted with the fractional second of real time required for the total recall.
    Presently, Paul moved slantwise up the slope, probing cautiously until he found the wall of the fissure, an outcurve of rock there. He began to dig, moving the sand with care not to dislodge another slide. A piece of fabric came under his hands. He followed it, found an arm. Gently, he traced the arm, exposed her face. 
    "Do you hear me?" he whispered. 
    No answer.
    He dug faster, freed her shoulders. She was limp beneath his hands, but he detected a slow heartbeat. 
    Bindu suspension, he told himself.
    He cleared the sand away to her waist, draped her arms over his shoulders and pulled downslope, slowly at first, then dragging her as fast as he could, feeling the sand give way above. Faster and faster he pulled her, gasping with the effort, fighting to keep his balance. He was out on the hard-packed floor of the fissure then, swinging her to his shoulder and breaking into a staggering run as the entire sandslope came down with a loud hiss that echoed and was magnified within the rock walls.
    He stopped at the end of the fissure where it looked out on the desert's marching dunes some thirty meters below. Gently, he lowered her to the sand, uttered the word to bring her out of the catalepsis.
    She awakened slowly, taking deeper and deeper breaths. 
    "I knew you'd find me," she whispered.
    He looked back up the fissure. "It might have been kinder if I hadn't." 
    "Paul!"
    "I lost the pack," he said. "It's buried under a hundred tons of sand . . . at least." 
    "Everything?"
    "The spare water, the stilltent--everything that counts." He touched a pocket. "I still have the paracompass." He fumbled at the waist sash. "Knife and binoculars. We can get a good look around the place where we'll die."
    In that instant, the sun lifted above the horizon somewhere to the left beyond the end of the fissure. Colors blinked in the sand out on the open desert. A chorus of birds held forth their songs from hidden places among the rocks.
    But Jessica had eyes only for the despair in Paul's face. She edged her voice with scorn, said: "Is this the way you were taught?"
    "Don't you understand?" he asked. "Everything we need to survive in this place is under that sand."
    "You found me," she said, and now her voice was soft, reasonable.
    Paul squatted back on his heels.
    Presently, he looked up the fissure at the new slope, studying it, marking the looseness of the sand.
    "If we could immobilize a small area of that slope and the upper face of a hole dug into the sand, we might be able to put down a shaft to the pack. Water might do it, but we don't have enough water for . . ." He broke off, then: "Foam."
    Jessica held herself to stillness lest she disturb the hyper-functioning of his mind.
    Paul looked out at the open dunes, searching with his nostrils as well as his eyes, finding the direction and then centering his attention on a darkened patch of sand below them.
    "Spice," he said. "Its essence--highly alkaline. And I have the paracompass. Its power pack is acid-base." 
    Jessica sat up straight against the rock.
    Paul ignored her, leaped to his feet, and was off down the wind-compacted surface that spilled from the end of the fissure to the desert's floor.
    She watched the way he walked, breaking his stride--step . . . pause, step-step . . . slide . . . pause . . .
    There was no rhythm to it that might tell a marauding worm something not of the desert moved here.
    Paul reached the spice patch, shoveled a mound of it into a fold of his robe, returned to the fissure. He spilled the spice onto the sand in front of Jessica, squatted and began dismantling the paracompass, using the point of his knife. The compass face came off. He removed his sash, spread the compass parts on it, lifted out the power pack. The dial mechanism came out next, leaving an empty dished compartment in the instrument. 
    "You'll need water," Jessica said.
    Paul took the catchtube from his neck, sucked up a mouthful, expelled it into the dished compartment.
    If this fails, that's water wasted, Jessica thought. But it won't matter then, anyway.
    With his knife, Paul cut open the power pack, spilled its crystals into the water. They foamed slightly, subsided.
    Jessica's eyes caught motion above them. She looked up to see a line of hawks along the rim of the fissure. They perched there staring down at the open water.
    Great Mother! she thought. They can sense water even at that distance!
    Paul had the cover back on the paracompass, leaving off the reset button which gave a small hole into the liquid. Taking the reworked instrument in one hand, a handful of spice in the other, Paul went back up the fissure, studying the lay of the slope. His robe billowed gently without the sash to hold it. He waded part way up the slope, kicking off sand rivulets, spurts of dust.
    Presently, he stopped, pressed a pinch of the spice into the paracompass, shook the instrument case.
    Green foam boiled out of the hole where the reset button had been. Paul aimed it at the slope, spread a low dike there, began kicking away the sand beneath it, immobilizing the opened face with more foam.
    Jessica moved to a position below him, called out: "May I help?"
    "Come up and dig," he said. "We've about three meters to go. It's going to be a near thing." As he spoke, the foam stopped billowing from the instrument.
    "Quickly," Paul said. "No telling how long this foam will hold the sand."
    Jessica scrambled up beside Paul as he sifted another pinch of spice into the hole, shook the paracompass case. Again, foam boiled from it.
    As Paul directed the foam barrier, Jessica dug with her hands, hurling the sand down the slope. "How deep?" she panted.
    "About three meters," he said. "And I can only approximate the position. We may have to widen this hole." He moved a step aside, slipping in loose sand. "Slant your digging backward. Don't go straight down." 
    Jessica obeyed.
    Slowly, the hole went down, reaching a level even with the floor of the basin and still no sign of the pack.
    Could I have miscalculated? Paul asked himself. I'm the one that panicked originally and caused this mistake. Has that warped my ability?
    He looked at the paracompass. Less than two ounces of the acid infusion remained.
    Jessica straightened in the hole, rubbed a foam-stained hand across her cheek. Her eyes met Paul's.
    "The upper face," Paul said. "Gently, now." He added another pinch of spice to the container, sent the foam boiling around Jessica's hands as she began cutting a vertical face in the upper slant of the hole. On the second pass, her hands encountered something hard. Slowly, she worked out a length of strap with a plastic buckle.
    "Don't move any more of it," Paul said and his voice was almost a whisper.
    "We're out of foam." 
    Jessica held the strap in one hand, looked up at him.
    Paul threw the empty paracompass down onto the floor of the basin, said: "Give me your other hand. Now listen carefully. I'm going to pull you to the side and downhill. Don't let go of that strap. We won't get much more spill from the top. This slope has stabilized itself. All I'm going to aim for is to keep your head free of the sand. Once that hole's filled, we can dig you out and pull up the pack." 
    "I understand," she said. 
    "Ready?" 
    "Ready." She tensed her fingers on the strap.
    With one surge, Paul had her half out of the hole, holding her head up as the foam barrier gave way and sand spilled down. When it had subsided, Jessica remained buried to the waist, her left arm and shoulder still under the sand, her chin protected on a fold of Paul's robe. Her shoulder ached from the strain put on it. 
    "I still have the strap," she said.
    Slowly, Paul worked his hand into the sand beside her, found the strap. "Together," he said. "Steady pressure. We mustn't break it."
    More sand spilled down as they worked the pack up. When the strap cleared the surface, Paul stopped, freed his mother from the sand. Together then they pulled the pack downslope and out of its trap.
    In a few minutes they stood on the floor of the fissure holding the pack between them.
    Paul looked at his mother. Foam stained her face, her robe. Sand was caked to her where the foam had dried. She looked as though she had been a target for balls of wet, green sand. 
    "You look a mess," he said.
    "You're not so pretty yourself," she said. 
    They started to laugh, then sobered.
    "That shouldn't have happened," Paul said. "I was careless." 
    She shrugged, feeling caked sand fall away from her robe.
    "I'll put up the tent," he said. "Better slip off that robe and shake it out." He turned away, taking the pack. 
    Jessica nodded, suddenly too tired to answer.
    "There's anchor holes in the rock," Paul said. "Someone's tented here before."
    Why not? she thought as she brushed at her robe. This was a likely place--deep in rock walls and facing another cliff some four kilometers away--far enough above the desert to avoid worms but close enough for easy access before a crossing.
    She turned, seeing that Paul had the tent up, its rib-domed hemisphere blending with the rock walls of the fissure. Paul stepped past her, lifting his binoculars. He adjusted their internal pressure with a quick twist, focused the oil lenses on the other cliff lifting golden tan in morning light across open sand.
    Jessica watched as he studied that apocalyptic landscape, his eyes probing into sand rivers and canyons.
    "There are growing things over there," he said.
    Jessica found the spare binoculars in the pack beside the tent, moved up beside Paul.
    "There," he said, holding the binoculars with one hand and pointing with the other.
    She looked where he pointed.
    "Saguaro," she said. "Scrawny stuff." 
    "There may be people nearby," Paul said.
    "That could be the remains of a botanical testing station," she warned.
    "This is pretty far south into the desert," he said. He lowered his binoculars, rubbed beneath his filter baffle, feeling how dry and chapped his lips were, sensing the dusty taste of thirst in his mouth. "This has the feeling of a Fremen place," he said.
    "Are we certain the Fremen will be friendly?" she asked. 
    "Kynes promised their help."
    But there's desperation in the people of this desert, she thought. I felt some of it myself today. Desperate people might kill us for our water.
    She closed her eyes and, against this wasteland, conjured in her mind a scene from Caladan. There had been a vacation trip once on Caladan--she and the Duke Leto, before Paul's birth. They'd flown over the southern jungles, above the weed-wild shouting leaves and rice paddies of the deltas. And they had seen the ant lines in the greenery--man-gangs carrying their loads on suspensor-buoyed shoulder poles. And in the sea reaches there'd been the white petals of trimaran dhows. 
    All of it gone.
    Jessica opened her eyes to the desert stillness, to the mounting warmth of the day. Restless heat devils were beginning to set the air aquiver out on the open sand. The other rock face across from them was like a thing seen through cheap glass.
    A spill of sand spread its brief curtain across the open end of the fissure. The sand hissed down, loosed by puffs of morning breeze, by the hawks that were beginning to lift away from the clifftop. When the sandfall was gone, she still heard it hissing. It grew louder, a sound that once heard, was never forgotten. 
    "Worm," Paul whispered.
    It came from their right with an uncaring majesty that could not be ignored. A twisting burrow-mound of sand cut through the dunes within their field of vision. The mound lifted in front, dusting away like a bow wave in water. Then it was gone, coursing off to the left. 
    The sound diminished, died.
    "I've seen space frigates that were smaller," Paul whispered.
    She nodded, continuing to stare across the desert. Where the worm had passed there remained that tantalizing gap. It flowed bitterly endless before them, beckoning beneath its horizontal collapse of skyline.
    "When we've rested," Jessica said, "we should continue with your lessons."
    He suppressed a sudden anger, said: "Mother, don't you think we could do without . . ."
    "Today you panicked," she said. "You know your mind and bindu-nervature perhaps better than I do, but you've much yet to learn about your body's prana-musculature. The body does things of itself sometimes, Paul, and I can teach you about this. You must learn to control every muscle, every fiber of your body. You need review of the hands. We'll start with finger muscles, palm tendons, and tip sensitivity." She turned away. "Come, into the tent, now." 
    He flexed the fingers of his left hand, watching her crawl through the sphincter valve, knowing that he could not deflect her from this determination . . . that he must agree.
    Whatever has been done to me, I've been a party to it, he thought. 
    Review of the hand!
    He looked at his hand. How inadequate it appeared when measured against such creatures as that worm.

We came from Caladan--a paradise world for our form of fife. There existed no need on Caladan to build a physical paradise or a paradise of the mind--we could see the actuality all around us. And the price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise in this life--we went soft, we lost our edge.
-from "Muad'Dib: Conversations" by the Princess Irulan

    "So you're the great Gurney Halleck," the man said.
    Halleck stood staring across the round cavern office at the smuggler seated behind a metal desk. The man wore Fremen robes and had the half-tint blue eyes that told of off-planet foods in his diet. The office duplicated a space frigate's master control center--communications and viewscreens along a thirty-degree arc of wall, remote arming and firing banks adjoining, and the desk formed as a wall projection--part of the remaining curve.
    "I am Staban Tuek, son of Esmar Tuek," the smuggler said.
    "Then you're the one I owe thanks for the help we've received," Halleck said.
    "Ah-h-h, gratitude," the smuggler said. "Sit down." 
    A ship-type bucket seat emerged from the wall beside the screens and Halleck sank onto it with a sigh, feeling his weariness. He could see his own reflection now in a dark surface beside the smuggler and scowled at the lines of fatigue in his lumpy face. The inkvine scar along his jaw writhed with the scowl.
    Halleck turned from his reflection, stared at Tuek. He saw the family resemblance in the smuggler now--the father's heavy, over-hanging eyebrows and rock planes of cheeks and nose.
    "Your men tell me your father is dead, killed by the Harkonnens," Halleck said.
    "By the Harkonnens or by a traitor among your people," Tuek said.
    Anger overcame part of Halleck's fatigue. He straightened, said: "Can you name the traitor?" 
    "We are not sure." 
    "Thufir Hawat suspected the Lady Jessica."
    "Ah-h-h, the Bene Gesserit witch . . . perhaps. But Hawat is now a Harkonnen captive."
    "I heard," Halleck took a deep breath. "It appears we've a deal more killing ahead of us." 
    "We will do nothing to attract attention to us," Tuek said. 
    Halleck stiffened. "But--"
    "You and those of your men we've saved are welcome to sanctuary among us," Tuek said. "You speak of gratitude. Very well; work off your debt to us. We can always use good men. We'll destroy you out of hand, though, if you make the slightest open move against the Harkonnens." 
    "But they killed your father, man!"
    "Perhaps. And if so, I'll give you my father's answer to those who act without thinking: 'A stone is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.' " 
    "You mean to do nothing about it, then?" Halleck sneered.
    "You did not hear me say that. I merely say I will protect our contract with the Guild. The Guild requires that we play a circumspect game. There are other ways of destroying a foe." 
    "Ah-h-h-h-h."
    "Ah, indeed. If you've a mind to seek out the witch, have at it. But I warn you that you're probably too late . . .and we doubt she's the one you want, any way." 
    "Hawat made few mistakes." 
    "He allowed himself to fall into Harkonnen hands." 
    "You think he's the traitor?"
    Tuek shrugged. "This is academic. We think the witch is dead. At least the Harkonnens believe it." 
    "You seem to know a great deal about the Harkonnens." 
    "Hints and suggestions . . . rumors and hunches." 
    "We are seventy-four men," Halleck said. "If you seriously wish us to enlist with you, you must believe our Duke is dead." 
    "His body has been seen." 
    "And the boy, too--young Master Paul?" Halleck tried to swallow, found a lump in his throat.
    "According to the last word we had, he was lost with his mother in a desert storm. Likely not even their bones will ever be found." 
    "So the witch is dead then . . . all dead."
    Tuek nodded. "And Beast Rabban, so they say, will sit once more in the seat of power here on Dune." 
    "The Count Rabban of Lankiveil?" 
    "Yes."
    It took Halleck a moment to put down the upsurge of rage that threatened to overcome him. He spoke with panting breath: "I've a score of my own against Rabban. I owe him for the lives of my family . . . " He rubbed at the scar along his jaw. " . . . and for this . . . "
    "One does not risk everything to settle a score prematurely," Tuek said. He frowned, watching the play of muscles along Halleck's jaw, the sudden withdrawal in the man's shed-lidded eyes.
    "I know . . . I know." Halleck took a deep breath.
    "You and your men can work out your passage off Arrakis by serving with us. There are many places to--"
    "I release my men from any bond to me; they can choose for themselves. With Rabban here--I stay." 
    "In your mood, I'm not sure we want you to stay." 
    Halleck stared at the smuggler. "You doubt my word?" 
    "No-o-o . . . "
    "You've saved me from the Harkonnens. I gave loyalty to the Duke Leto for no greater reason. I'll stay on Arrakis--with you . . . or with the Fremen."
    "Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and it has power," Tuek said. "You might find the line between life and death among the Fremen to be too sharp and quick." 
    Halleck closed his eyes briefly, feeling the weariness surge up in him. "Where is the Lord who led us through the land of deserts and of pits?" he murmured.
    "Move slowly and the day of your revenge will come," Tuek said. "Speed is a device of Shaitan. Cool your sorrow--we've the diversions for it; three things there are that ease the heart--water, green grass, and the beauty of woman."
    Halleck opened his eyes. "I would prefer the blood of Rabban Harkonnen flowing about my feet." He stared at Tuek. "You think that day will come?"
    "I have little to do with how you'll meet tomorrow, Gurney Halleck. I can only help you meet today."
    "Then I'll accept that help and stay until the day you tell me to revenge your father and all the others who--"
    "Listen to me, fighting man," Tuek said. He leaned forward over his desk, his shoulders level with his ears, eyes intent. The smuggler's face was suddenly like weathered stone. "My father's water--I'll buy that back myself, with my own blade." 
    Halleck stared back at Tuek. In that moment, the smuggler reminded him of Duke Leto: a leader of men, courageous, secure in his own position and his own course. He was like the Duke . . . before Arrakis.
    "Do you wish my blade beside you?" Halleck asked. 
    Tuek sat back, relaxed, studying Halleck silently. 
    "Do you think of me as fighting man? " Halleck pressed.
    "You're the only one of the Duke's lieutenants to escape," Tuek said. "Your enemy was overwhelming, yet you rolled with him . . . You defeated him the way we defeat Arrakis." 
    "Eh?"
    "We live on sufferance down here, Gurney Halleck," Tuek said. "Arrakis is our enemy." 
    "One enemy at a time, is that it?" 
    "That's it." 
    "Is that the way the Fremen make out?" 
    "Perhaps."
    "You said I might find life with the Fremen too tough. They live in the desert, in the open, is that why?"
    "Who knows where the Fremen live? For us, the Central Plateau is a no-man's land. But I wish to talk more about--" 
    "I'm told that the Guild seldom routes spice lighters in over the desert," Halleck said. "But there are rumors that you can see bits of greenery here and there if you know where to look." 
    "Rumors!" Tuek sneered. "Do you wish to choose now between me and the Fremen? We have a measure of security, our own sietch carved out of the rock, our own hidden basins. We live the lives of civilized men. The Fremen are a few ragged bands that we use as spice-hunters." 
    "But they can kill Harkonnens."
    "And do you wish to know the result? Even now they are being hunted down like animals--with lasguns, because they have no shields. They are being exterminated. Why? Because they killed Harkonnens." 
    "Was it Harkonnens they killed?" Halleck asked. 
    "What do you mean?"
    "Haven't you heard that there may've been Sardaukar with the Harkonnens?" 
    "More rumors."
    "But a pogrom--that isn't like the Harkonnens. A pogrom is wasteful."
    "I believe what I see with my own eyes," Tuek said. "Make your choice, fighting man. Me or the Fremen. I will promise you sanctuary and a chance to draw the blood we both want. Be sure of that. The Fremen will offer you only the life of the hunted." 
    Halleck hesitated, sensing wisdom and sympathy in Tuek's words, yet troubled for no reason he could explain.
    "Trust your own abilities," Tuek said. "Whose decisions brought your force through the battle? Yours. Decide." 
    "It must be," Halleck said. "The Duke and his son are dead?" 
    "The Harkonnens believe it. Where such things are concerned, I incline to trust the Harkonnens." A grim smile touched Tuek's mouth. "But it's about the only trust I give them." 
    "Then it must be," Halleck repeated. He held out his right hand, palm up and thumb folded flat against it in the traditional gesture. "I give you my sword." 
    "Accepted." 
    "Do you wish me to persuade my men?" 
    "You'd let them make their own decision?"
    "They've followed me this far, but most are Caladan-born. Arrakis isn't what they thought it'd be. Here, they've lost everything except their lives. I'd prefer they decided for themselves now."
    "Now is no time for you to falter," Tuek said. "They've followed you this far." 
    "You need them, is that it?"
    "We can always use experienced fighting men . . . in these times more than ever."
    "You've accepted my sword. Do you wish me to persuade them?" 
    "I think they'll follow you, Gurney Halleck." 
    " 'Tis to be hoped." 
    "Indeed." 
    "I may make my own decision in this, then?" 
    "Your own decision."
    Halleck pushed himself up from the bucket seat, feeling how much of his reserve strength even that small effort required. "For now, I'll see to their quarters and well-being," he said.
    "Consult my quartermaster," Tuek said. "Drisq is his name. Tell him it's my wish that you receive every courtesy. I'll join you myself presently. I've some off-shipments of spice to see to first." 
    "Fortune passes everywhere," Halleck said.
    "Everywhere," Tuek said. "A time of upset is a rare opportunity for our business."
    Halleck nodded, heard the faint sussuration and felt the air shift as a lockport swung open beside him. He turned, ducked through it and out of the office.
    He found himself in the assembly hall through which he and his men had been led by Tuek's aides. It was a long, fairly narrow area chewed out of the native rock, its smooth surface betraying the use of cutteray burners for the job. The ceiling stretched away high enough to continue the natural supporting curve of the rock and to permit internal air-convection currents. Weapons racks and lockers lined the walls.
    Halleck noted with a touch of pride that those of his men still able to stand were standing--no relaxation in weariness and defeat for them. Smuggler medics were moving among them tending the wounded. Litter cases were assembled in one area down to the left, each wounded man with an Atreides companion.
    The Atreides training--"We care for our own!"--it held like a core of native rock in them, Halleck noted.
    One of his lieutenants stepped forward carrying Halleck's nine-string baliset out of its case. The man snapped a salute, said: "Sir, the medics here say there's no hope for Mattai. They have no bone and organ banks here--only outpost medicine. Mattai can't last, they say, and he has a request of you." 
    "What is it?"
    The lieutenant thrust the baliset forward. "Mattai wants a song to ease his going, sir. He says you'll know the one . . . he's asked it of you often enough." The lieutenant swallowed. "It's the one called 'My Woman,' sir. If you--"
    "I know." Halleck took the baliset, flicked the multipick out of its catch on the fingerboard. He drew a soft chord from the instrument, found that someone had already tuned it. There was a burning in his eyes, but he drove that out of his thoughts as he strolled forward, strumming the tune, forcing himself to smile casually.
    Several of his men and a smuggler medic were bent over one of the litters. One of the men began singing softly as Halleck approached, catching the counter-beat with the ease of long familiarity:

"My woman stands at her window, 
Curved lines 'gainst square glass. 
Uprais'd arms . . . bent . . . downfolded. 
'Gainst sunset red and golded--
Come to me . . .
Come to me, warm arms of my lass. 
For me . . .
For me, the warm arms of my lass."

    The singer stopped, reached out a bandaged arm and closed the eyelids of the man on the litter.
    Halleck drew a final soft chord from the baliset, thinking: Now we are seventy-three.

Family life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but I shall try to give you a capsule view of it. My father had only one real friend, I think. That was Count Hasimir Fenring, the genetic-eunuch and one of the deadliest fighters in the Imperium. The Count, a dapper and ugly little man, brought a new slave-concubine to my father one day and I was dispatched by my mother to spy on the proceedings. All of us spied on my father as a matter of self-protection. One of the slave-concubines permitted my father under the Bene Gesserit-Guild agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor, but the intrigues were constant and oppressive in their similarity. We became adept, my mother and sisters and I, at avoiding subtle instruments of death. It may seem a dreadful thing to say, but I 'm not at all sure my father was innocent in all these attempts. A Royal Family is not like other families. Here was a new slave-concubine, then, red-haired like my father, willowy and graceful. She had a dancer's muscles, and her training obviously had included neuro-enticement. My father looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed before him. Finally he said: "She is too beautiful. We will save her as a gift. " You have no idea how much consternation this restraint created in the Royal Creche. Subtlety and self-control were, after all, the most deadly threats to us all.
-"In My Father's House" by the Princess Irulan

    Paul stood outside the stilltent in the late afternoon. The crevasse where he had pitched their camp lay in deep shadow. He stared out across the open sand at the distant cliff, wondering if he should waken his mother, who lay asleep in the tent.
    Folds upon folds of dunes spread beyond their shelter. Away from the setting sun, the dunes exposed greased shadows so black they were like bits of night. 
    And the flatness.
    His mind searched for something tall in that landscape. But there was no persuading tallness out of heat-addled air and that horizon--no bloom or gently shaken thing to mark the passage of a breeze . . . only dunes and that distant cliff beneath a sky of burnished silver-blue.
    What if there isn't one of the abandoned testing stations across there? he wondered. What if there are no Fremen, either, and the plants we see are only an accident?
    Within the tent, Jessica awakened, turned onto her back and peered sidelong out the transparent end at Paul, He stood with his back to her and something about his stance reminded her of his father. She sensed the well of grief rising within her and turned away.
    Presently she adjusted her stillsuit, refreshed herself with water from the tent's catchpocket, and slipped out to stand and stretch the sleep from her muscles.
    Paul spoke without turning: "I find myself enjoying the quiet here."
    How the mind gears itself for its environment, she thought. And she recalled a Bene Gesserit axiom: "The mind can go either direction under stress--toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training." 
    "It could be a good life here," Paul said.
    She tried to see the desert through his eyes, seeking to encompass all the rigors this planet accepted as commonplace, wondering at the possible futures Paul had glimpsed. One could be alone out here, she thought, without fear of someone behind you, without fear of the hunter.
    She stepped past Paul, lifted her binoculars, adjusted the oil lenses and studied the escarpment across from them. Yes, saguaro in the arroyos and other spiny growth . . . and a matting of low grasses, yellow-green in the shadows.
    "I'll strike camp," Paul said.
    Jessica nodded, walked to the fissure's mouth where she could get a sweep of the desert, and swung her binoculars to the left. A salt pan glared white there with a blending of dirty tan at its edges--a field of white out here where white was death. But the pan said another thing: water. At some time water had flowed across that glaring white. She lowered her binoculars, adjusted her burnoose, listened for a moment to the sound of Paul's movements.
    The sun dipped lower. Shadows stretched across the salt pan. Lines of wild color spread over the sunset horizon. Color streamed into a toe of darkness testing the sand. Coal-colored shadows spread, and the thick collapse of night blotted the desert. 
    Stars!
    She stared up at them, sensing Paul's movements as he came up beside her. The desert night focused upward with a feeling of lift toward the stars. The weight of the day receded. There came a brief flurry of breeze across her face.
    "The first moon will be up soon," Paul said.  "The pack's ready. I've planted the thumper."
    We could be lost forever in this hellplace, she thought. And no one to know.
    The night wind spread sand runnels that grated across her face, bringing the smell of cinnamon: a shower of odors in the dark. 
    "Smell that," Paul said.
    "I can smell it even through the filter," she said. "Riches. But will it buy water?" She pointed across the basin. "There are no artificial lights across there."
    "Fremen would be hidden in a sietch behind those rocks," he said.
    A sill of silver pushed above the horizon to their right: the first moon. It lifted into view, the hand pattern plain on its face. Jessica studied the white-silver of sand exposed in the light.
    "I planted the thumper in the deepest part of the crevasse," Paul said. "Whenever I light its candle it'll give us about thirty minutes." 
    "Thirty minutes?" 
    "Before it starts calling . . . a . . . worm." 
    "Oh. I'm ready to go."
    He slipped away from her side and she heard his progress back up their fissure.
    The night is a tunnel, she thought, a hole into tomorrow . . . if we 're to have a tomorrow. She shook her head. Why must I be so morbid? I was trained better than that!
    Paul returned, took up the pack, led the way down to the first spreading dune where he stopped and listened as his mother came up behind him. He heard her soft progress and the cold single-grain dribbles of sound--the desert's own code spelling out its measure of safety.
    "We must walk without rhythm," Paul said and he called up memory of men walking the sand . . . both prescient memory and real memory.
    "Watch how I do it," he said. "This is how Fremen walk the sand."
    He stepped out onto the windward face of the dune, following the curve of it, moved with a dragging pace.
    Jessica studied his progress for ten steps, followed, imitating him. She saw the sense of it: they must sound like the natural shifting of sand . . . like the wind. But muscles protested this unnatural, broken pattern: Step . . . drag . . . drag . . . step . . . step . . . wait . . . drag . . . step . . .
    Time stretched out around them. The rock face ahead seemed to grow no nearer. The one behind still lowered high. 
    "Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!" 
    It was a drumming from the cliff behind. 
    "The thumper," Paul hissed.
    Its pounding continued and they found difficulty avoiding the rhythm of it in their stride.
    "Lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . lump . . ."
    They moved in a moonlit bowl punctured by that hollowed thumping. Down and up through spilling dunes: step . . .drag . . . wait . . . step . . . Across pea sand that rolled under their feet: drag . . . wait . . . step . . .
    And all the while their ears searched for a special hissing.
    The sound, when it came, started so low that their own dragging passage masked it. But it grew . . . louder and louder . . . out of the west.
    "Lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . " drummed the thumper.
    The hissing approach spread across the night behind them. They turned their heads as they walked, saw the mound of the coursing worm.
    "Keep moving," Paul whispered. "Don't look back." 
    A grating sound of fury exploded from the rock shadows they had left. It was a flailing avalanche of noise. 
    "Keep moving," Paul repeating.
    He saw that they had reached an unmarked point where the two rock faces--the one ahead and the one behind--appeared equally remote.
    And still behind them, that whipping, frenzied tearing of rocks dominated the night.
    They moved on and on and on . . . Muscles reached a stage of mechanical aching that seemed to stretch out indefinitely, but Paul saw that the beckoning, escarpment ahead of them had climbed higher.
    Jessica moved in a void of concentration, aware that the pressure of her will alone kept her walking. Dryness ached in her mouth, but the sounds behind drove away all hope of stopping for a sip from her stillsuit's catchpockets. 
    "Lump . . . lump . . . "
    Renewed frenzy erupted from the distant cliff, drowning out the thumper. 
    Silence!
    "Faster," Paul whispered.
    She nodded, knowing he did not see the gesture, but needing the action to tell herself that it was necessary to demand even more from muscles that already were being taxed to their limits--the unnatural movement . . . 
    The rock face of safety ahead of them climbed into the stars, and Paul saw a plane of flat sand stretching out at the base. He stepped onto it, stumbled in his fatigue, righted himself with an involuntary out-thrusting of a foot.
    Resonant booming shook the sand around them. 
    Paul lurched sideways two steps. 
    "Boom! Boom!" 
    "Drum sand!" Jessica hissed.
    Paul recovered his balance. A sweeping glance took in the sand around them, the rock escarpment perhaps two hundred meters away.
    Behind them, he heard a hissing--like the wind, like a riptide where there was no water.
    "Run!" Jessica screamed. "Paul, run!" 
    They ran.
    Drum sound boomed beneath their feet. Then they were out of it and into pea gravel. For a time, the running was a relief to muscles that ached from unfamiliar, rhythmless use. Here was action that could be understood. Here was rhythm. But sand and gravel dragged at their feet. And the hissing approach of the worm was storm sound that grew around them.
    Jessica stumbled to her knees. All she could think of was the fatigue and the sound and the terror. 
    Paul dragged her up. 
    They ran on, hand in hand.
    A thin pole jutted from the sand ahead of them. They passed it, saw another.
    Jessica's mind failed to register on the poles until they were past.
    There was another--wind-etched surface thrust up from a crack in rock.
    Another. 
    Rock!
    She felt it through her feet, the shock of unresisting surface, gained new strength from the firmer footing.
    A deep crack stretched its vertical shadow upward into the cliff ahead of them. They sprinted for it, crowded into the narrow hole. 
    Behind them, the sound of the worm's passage stopped. 
    Jessica and Paul turned, peered out onto the desert.
    Where the dunes began, perhaps fifty meters away at the foot of a rock beach, a silver-gray curve broached from the desert, sending rivers of sand and dust cascading all around. It lifted higher, resolved into a giant, questing mouth. It was a round, black hole with edges glistening in the moonlight.
    The mouth snaked toward the narrow crack where Paul and Jessica huddled. Cinnamon yelled in their nostrils. Moonlight flashed from crystal teeth.
    Back and forth the great mouth wove. 
    Paul stilled his breathing. 
    Jessica crouched staring.
    It took intense concentration of her Bene Gesserit training to put down the primal terrors, subduing a race-memory fear that threatened to fill her mind. 
    Paul felt a kind of elation. In some recent instant, he had crossed a time barrier into more unknown territory. He could sense the darkness ahead, nothing revealed to his inner eye. It was as though some step he had taken had plunged him into a well . . . or into the trough of a wave where the future was invisible. The landscape had undergone a profound shifting.
    Instead of frightening him, the sensation of time-darkness forced a hyper-acceleration of his other senses. He found himself registering every available aspect of the thing that lifted from the sand there seeking him. Its mouth was some eighty meters in diameter . . . crystal teeth with the curved shape of crysknives glinting around the rim . . . the bellows breath of cinnamon, subtle aldehydes . . . acids . . . 
    The worm blotted out the moonlight as it brushed the rocks above them. A shower of small stones and sand cascaded into the narrow hiding place.
    Paul crowded his mother farther back. 
    Cinnamon!
    The smell of it flooded across him.
    What has the worm to do with the spice, melange? he asked himself. And he remembered Liet-Kynes betraying a veiled reference to some association between worm and spice. 
    "Barrrroooom!" 
    It was like a peal of dry thunder coming from far off to their right. 
    Again: "Barrrroooom!"
    The worm drew back onto the sand, lay there momentarily, its crystal teeth weaving moonflashes. 
    "Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!" 
    Another thumper! Paul thought. 
    Again it sounded off to their right.
    A shudder passed through the worm. It drew farther away into the sand. Only a mounded upper curve remained like half a bell mouth, the curve of a tunnel rearing above the dunes. 
    Sand rasped.
    The creature sank farther, retreating, turning. It became a mound of cresting sand that curved away through a saddle in the dunes.
    Paul stepped out of the crack, watched the sand wave recede across the waste toward the new thumper summons.
    Jessica followed, listening: "Lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . lump . . ." 
    Presently the sound stopped.
    Paul found the tube into his stillsuit, sipped at the reclaimed water.
    Jessica focused on his action, but her mind felt blank with fatigue and the aftermath of terror. "Has it gone for sure?" she whispered. 
    "Somebody called it," Paul said. "Fremen." 
    She felt herself recovering. "It was so big!" 
    "Not as big as the one that got our 'thopter." 
    "Are you sure it was Fremen?" 
    "They used a thumper." 
    "Why would they help us?"
    "Maybe they weren't helping us. Maybe they were just calling a worm." 
    "Why?"
    An answer lay poised at the edge of his awareness, but refused to come. He had a vision in his mind of something to do with the telescoping barbed sticks in their packs--the "maker hooks." 
    "Why would they call a worm?" Jessica asked.
    A breath of fear touched his mind, and he forced himself to turn away from his mother, to look up the cliff. "We'd better find a way up there before daylight." He pointed. "Those poles we passed--there are more of them."
    She looked, following the line of his hand, saw the poles--wind-scratched markers--made out the shadow of a narrow ledge that twisted into a crevasse high above them.
    "They mark a way up the cliff," Paul said. He settled his shoulders into the pack, crossed to the foot of the ledge and began the climb upward.
    Jessica waited a moment, resting, restoring her strength; then she followed.
    Up they climbed, following the guide poles until the ledge dwindled to a narrow lip at the mouth of a dark crevasse.
    Paul tipped his head to peer into the shadowed place. He could feel the precarious hold his feet had on the slender ledge, but forced himself to slow caution. He saw only darkness within the crevasse. It stretched away upward, open to the stars at the top. His ears searched, found only sounds he could expect--a tiny spill of sand, an insect brrr, the patter of a small running creature. He tested the darkness in the crevasse with one foot, found rock beneath a gritting surface. Slowly, he inched around the corner, signaled for his mother to follow. He grasped a loose edge of her robe, helped her around.
    They looked upward at starlight framed by two rock lips. Paul saw his mother beside him as a cloudy gray movement. "If we could only risk a light," he whispered. 
    "We have other senses than eyes," she said.
    Paul slid a foot forward, shifted his weight, and probed with the other foot, met an obstruction. He lifted his foot, found a step, pulled himself up onto it. He reached back, felt his mother's arm, tugged at her robe for her to follow. 
    Another step.
    "It goes on up to the top, I think," he whispered.
    Shallow and even steps, Jessica thought. Man-carved beyond a doubt.
    She followed the shadowy movement of Paul's progress, feeling out the steps. Rock walls narrowed until her shoulders almost brushed them. The steps ended in a slitted defile about twenty meters long, its floor level, and this opened onto a shallow, moonlit basin.
    Paul stepped out into the rim of the basin, whispered: "What a beautiful place."
    Jessica could only stare in silent agreement from her position a step behind him.
    In spite of weariness, the irritation of recaths and nose plugs and the confinement of the stillsuit, in spite of fear and the aching desire for rest, this basin's beauty filled her senses, forcing her to stop and admire it.
    "Like a fairyland," Paul whispered. 
    Jessica nodded.
    Spreading away in front of her stretched desert growth--bushes, cacti, tiny clumps of leaves--all trembling in the moonlight. The ringwalls were dark to her left, moonfrosted on her right. 
    "This must be a Fremen place," Paul said.
    "There would have to be people for this many plants to survive," she agreed. She uncapped the tube to her stillsuit's catchpockets, sipped at it. Warm, faintly acrid wetness slipped down her throat. She marked how it refreshed her. The tube's cap grated against flakes of sand as she replaced it.
    Movement caught Paul's attention--to his right and down on the basin floor curving out beneath them. He stared down through smoke bushes and weeds into a wedged slab sand-surface of moonlight inhabited by an up-hop, jump, pop-hop of tiny motion. 
    "Mice!" he hissed.
    Pop-hop-hop! they went, into shadows and out.
    Something fell soundlessly past their eyes into the mice. There came a thin screech, a flapping of wings, and a ghostly gray bird lifted away across the basin with a small, dark shadow in its talons. 
    We needed that reminder, Jessica thought.
    Paul continued to stare across the basin. He inhaled, sensed the softly cutting contralto smell of sage climbing the night. The predatory bird--he thought of it as the way of this desert. It had brought a stillness to the basin so unuttered that the blue-milk moonlight could almost be heard flowing across sentinel saguaro and spiked paintbrush. There was a low humming of light here more basic in its harmony than any other music in his universe.
    "We'd better find a place to pitch the tent," he said. "Tomorrow we can try to find the Fremen who--" 
    "Most intruders here regret finding the Fremen!" 
    It was a heavy masculine voice chopping across his words, shattering the moment. The voice came from above them and to their right.
    "Please do not run, intruders," the voice said as Paul made to withdraw into the defile. "If you run you'll only waste your body's water."
    They want us for the water of our flesh! Jessica thought. Her muscles overrode all fatigue, flowed into maximum readiness without external betrayal. She pinpointed the location of the voice, thinking: Such stealth! I didn't hear him. And she realized that the owner of that voice had permitted himself only the small sounds, the natural sounds of the desert.
    Another voice called from the basin's rim to their left. "Make it quick, Stil. Get their water and let's be on our way. We've little enough time before dawn."
    Paul, less conditioned to emergency response than his mother, felt chagrin that he had stiffened and tried to withdraw, that he had clouded his abilities by a momentary panic. He forced himself now to obey her teachings: relax, than fall into the semblance of relaxation, then into the arrested whipsnap of muscles that can slash in any direction.
    Still, he felt the edge of fear within him and knew its source. This was blind time, no future he had seen . . . and they were caught between wild Fremen whose only interest was the water carried in the flesh of two unshielded bodies.

This Fremen religious adaptation, then, is the source of what we now recognize as "The Pillars of the Universe," whose Qizara Tafwid are among us all with signs and proofs and prophecy. They bring us the Arrakeen mystical fusion whose profound beauty is typified by the stirring music built on the old forms, but stamped with the new awakening. Who has not heard and been deeply moved by "The Old Man's Hymn"? 
I drove my feet through a desert 
Whose mirage fluttered like a host. 
Voracious for glory, greedy for danger, 
I roamed the horizons of al-Kulab, 
Watching time level mountains 
In its search and its hunger for me. 
And I saw the sparrows swiftly approach, 
Bolder than the onrushing wolf. 
They spread in the tree of my youth.
I heard the flock in my branches 
And was caught on their beaks and claws!
-from "Arrakis Awakening" by the Princess Irulan

    The man crawled across a dunetop. He was a mote caught in the glare of the noon sun. He was dressed only in torn remnants of a jubba cloak, his skin bare to the heat through the tatters. The hood had been ripped from the cloak, but the man had fashioned a turban from a torn strip of cloth. Wisps of sandy hair protruded from it, matched by a sparse beard and thick brows. Beneath the blue-within-blue eyes, remains of a dark stain spread down to his cheeks. A matted depression across mustache and beard showed where a stillsuit tube had marked out its path from nose to catchpockets.
    The man stopped half across the dunecrest, arms stretched down the slipface. Blood had clotted on his back and on his arms and legs. Patches of yellow-gray sand clung to the wounds. Slowly, he brought his hands under him, pushed himself to his feet, stood there swaying. And even in this almost-random action there remained a trace of once-precise movement.
    "I am Liet-Kynes," he said, addressing himself to the empty horizon, and his voice was a hoarse caricature of the strength it had known. "I am His Imperial Majesty's Planetologist," he whispered, "planetary ecologist for Arrakis. I am steward of this land."
    He stumbled, fell sideways along the crusty surface of the windward face. His hands dug feebly into the sand. 
    I am steward of this sand, he thought.
    He realized that he was semi-delirious, that he should dig himself into the sand, find the relatively cool underlayer and cover himself with it. But he could still smell the rank, semisweet esters of a pre-spice pocket somewhere underneath this sand. He knew the peril within this fact more certainly than any other Fremen. If he could smell the pre-spice mass, that meant the gasses deep under the sand were nearing explosive pressure. He had to get away from here.
    His hands made weak scrabbling motions along the dune face.
    A thought spread across his mind--clear, distinct: The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization--agriculture.
    And he thought how strange it was that the mind, long fixed on a single track, could not get off that track. The Harkonnen troopers had left him here without water or stillsuit, thinking a worm would get him if the desert didn't. They had thought it amusing to leave him alive to die by inches at the impersonal hands of his planet.
    The Harkonnens always did find it difficult to kill Fremen, he thought. We don't die easily. I should be dead now . . . I will be dead soon . . . but I can't stop being an ecologist.
    "The highest function of ecology is understanding consequences."
    The voice shocked him because he recognized it and knew the owner of it was dead. It was the voice of his father who had been planetologist here before him--his father long dead, killed in the cave-in at Plaster Basin.
    "Got yourself into quite a fix here, Son," his father said. "You should've known the consequences of trying to help the child of that Duke." 
    I'm delirious, Kynes thought.
    The voice seemed to come from his right. Kynes scraped his face through sand, turning to look in that direction--nothing except a curving stretch of dune dancing with heat devils in the full glare of the sun.
    "The more life there is within a system, the more niches there are for life," his father said. And the voice came now from his left, from behind him.
    Why does he keep moving around? Kynes asked himself. Doesn't he want me to see him?
    "Life improves the capacity of the environment to sustain life," his father said. "Life makes needed nutrients more readily available. It binds more energy into the system through the tremendous chemical interplay from organism to organism." 
    Why does he keep harping on the same subject? Kynes asked himself. I knew that before I was ten.
    Desert hawks, carrion-eaters in this land as were most wild creatures, began to circle over him. Kynes saw a shadow pass near his hand, forced his head farther around to look upward. The birds were a blurred patch on silver-blue sky--distant flecks of soot floating above him.
    "We are generalists," his father said. "You can't draw neat lines around planet-wide problems. Planetology is a cut-and-fit science."
    What's he trying to tell me? Kynes wondered. Is there some consequence I failed to see?
    His cheek slumped back against the hot sand, and he smelled the burned rock odor beneath the pre-spice gasses. From some corner of logic in his mind, a thought formed: Those are carrion-eater birds over me. Perhaps some of my Fremen will see them and come to investigate.
    "To the working planetologist, his most important tool is human beings," his father said. "You must cultivate ecological, literacy among the people. That's why I've created this entirely new form of ecological notation."
    He's repeating things he said to me when I was a child, Kynes thought.
    He began to feel cool, but that corner of logic in his mind told him: The sun is overhead. You have no stillsuit and you're hot; the sun is burning the moisture out of your body. 
    His fingers clawed feebly at the sand. 
    They couldn't even leave me a stillsuit!
    "The presence of moisture in the air helps prevent too-rapid evaporation from living bodies," his father said. 
    Why does he keep repeating the obvious? Kynes wondered.
    He tried to think of moisture in the air--grass covering this dune . . . open water somewhere beneath him, a long qanat flowing with water open to the sky except in text illustrations. Open water . . . irrigation water . . . it took five thousand cubic meters of water to irrigate one hectare of land per growing season, he remembered.
    "Our first goal on Arrakis," his father said, "is grassland provinces. We will start with these mutated poverty grasses. When we have moisture locked in grasslands, we'll move on to start upland forests, then a few open bodies of water--small at first--and situated along lines of prevailing winds with windtrap moisture precipitators spaced in the lines to recapture what the wind steals. We must create a true sirocco--a moist wind--but we will never get away from the necessity for windtraps."
    Always lecturing me, Kynes thought. Why doesn't he shut up? Can't he see I'm dying?
    "You will die, too," his father said, "if you don't get off the bubble that's forming right now deep underneath you. It's there and you know it. You can smell the pre-spice gasses. You know the little makers are beginning to lose some of their water into the mass." 
    The thought of that water beneath him was maddening. He imagined it now--sealed off in strata of porous rock by the leathery half-plant, half-animal little makers--and the thin rupture that was pouring a cool stream of clearest, pure, liquid, soothing water into . . . 
    A pre-spice mass!
    He inhaled, smelling the rank sweetness. The odor was much richer around him than it had been.
    Kynes pushed himself to his knees, heard a bird screech, the hurried flapping of wings.
    This is spice desert, he thought. There must be Fremen about even in the day sun. Surely they can see the birds and will investigate.
    "Movement across the landscape is a necessity for animal life," his father said. "Nomad peoples follow the same necessity. Lines of movement adjust to physical needs for water, food, minerals. We must control this movement now, align it for our purposes." 
    "Shut up, old man," Kynes muttered.
    "We must do a thing on Arrakis never before attempted for an entire planet," his father said. "We must use man as a constructive ecological force--inserting adapted terraform life: a plant here, an animal there, a man in that place--to transform the water cycle, to build a new kind of landscape." 
    "Shut up!" Kynes croaked.
    "It was lines of movement that gave us the first clue to the relationship between worms and spice," his father said.
    A worm, Kynes thought with a surge of hope. A maker's sure to come when this bubble bursts. But I have no hooks. How can I mount a big maker without hooks?
    He could feel frustration sapping what little strength remained to him. Water so near--only a hundred meters or so beneath him; a worm sure to come, but no way to trap it on the surface and use it.
    Kynes pitched forward onto the sand, returning to the shallow depression his movements had defined. He felt sand hot against his left cheek, but the sensation was remote.
    "The Arrakeen environment built itself into the evolutionary pattern of native life forms," his father said. "How strange that so few people ever looked up from the spice long enough to wonder at the near-ideal nitrogen-oxygen-CO2 balance being maintained here in the absence of large areas of plant cover. The energy sphere of the planet is there to see and understand--a relentless process, but a process nonetheless. There is a gap in it? Then something occupies that gap. Science is made up of so many things that appear obvious after they are explained. I knew the little maker was there, deep in the sand, long before I ever saw it." 
    "Please stop lecturing me, Father," Kynes whispered.
    A hawk landed on the sand near his outstretched hand. Kynes saw it fold its wings, tip its head to stare at him. He summoned the energy to croak at it. The bird hopped away two steps, but continued to stare at him.
    "Men and their works have been a disease on the surface of their planets before now," his father said. "Nature tends to compensate for diseases, to remove or encapsulate them, to incorporate them into the system in her own way."
    The hawk lowered its head, stretched its wings, refolded them. It transferred its attention to his outstretched hand.
    Kynes found that he no longer had the strength to croak at it.
    "The historical system of mutual pillage and extortion stops here on Arrakis," his father said. "You cannot go on forever stealing what you need without regard to those who come after. The physical qualities of a planet are written into its economic and political record. We have the record in front of us and our course is obvious."
    He never could stop lecturing, Kynes thought. Lecturing, lecturing, lecturing--always lecturing.
    The hawk hopped one step closer to Kynes' outstretched hand, turned its head first one way and then the other to study the exposed flesh.
    "Arrakis is a one-crop planet," his father said. "One crop. It supports a ruling class that lives as ruling classes have lived in all times while, beneath them, a semihuman mass of semislaves exists on the leavings. It's the masses and the leavings that occupy our attention. These are far more valuable than has ever been suspected." 
    "I'm ignoring you, Father," Kynes whispered. "Go away." 
    And he thought: Surely there must be some of my Fremen near. They cannot help but see the birds over me. They will investigate if only to see if there's moisture available.
    "The masses of Arrakis will know that we work to make the land flow with water," his father said. "Most of them, of course, will have only a semimystical understanding of how we intend to do this. Many, not understanding the prohibitive mass-ratio problem, may even think we'll bring water from some other planet rich in it. Let them think anything they wish as long as they believe in us." 
    In a minute I'll get up and tell him what I think of him, Kynes thought. Standing there lecturing me when he should be helping me.
    The bird took another hop closer to Kynes' outstretched hand. Two more hawks drifted down to the sand behind it.
    "Religion and law among our masses must be one and the same," his father said. "An act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious penalties. This will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater bravery. We must depend not so much on the bravery of individuals, you see, as upon the bravery of a whole population."
    Where is my population now when I need it most? Kynes thought. He summoned all his strength, moved his hand a finger's width toward the nearest hawk. It hopped backward among its companions and all stood poised for flight.
    "Our timetable, will achieve the stature of a natural phenomenon," his father said. "A planet's life is a vast, tightly interwoven fabric. Vegetation and animal changes will be determined at first by the raw physical forces we manipulate. As they establish themselves, though, our changes will become controlling influences in their own right--and we will have to deal with them, too. Keep in mind, though, that we need control only three per cent of the energy surface--only three per cent--to tip the entire structure over into our self-sustaining system."
    Why aren't you helping we? Kynes wondered. Always the same: when I need you most, you fail me. He wanted to turn his head, to stare in the direction of his father's voice, stare the old man down. Muscles refused to answer his demand.
    Kynes saw the hawk move. It approached his hand, a cautious step at a time while its companions waited in mock indifference. The hawk stopped only a hop away from his hand.
    A profound clarity filled Kynes' mind. He saw quite suddenly a potential for Arrakis that his father had never seen. The possibilities along that different path flooded through him.
    "No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero," his father said. 
    Reading my mind! Kynes thought. Well . . . let him.
    The messages already have been sent to my sietch villages, he thought. Nothing can stop them. If the Duke's son is alive they'll find him and protect him as I have commanded. They may discard the woman, his mother, but they'll save the boy.
    The hawk took one hop that brought it within slashing distance of his hand. It tipped its head to examine the supine flesh. Abruptly, it straightened, stretched its head upward and with a single screech, leaped into the air and banked away overhead with its companions behind it.
    They've come! Kynes thought. My Fremen have found me! 
    Then he heard the sand rumbling.
    Every Fremen knew the sound, could distinguish it immediately from the noises of worms or other desert life. Somewhere beneath him, the pre-spice mass had accumulated enough water and organic matter from the little makers, had reached the critical stage of wild growth. A gigantic bubble of carbon dioxide was forming deep in the sand, heaving upward in an enormous "blow" with a dust whirlpool at its center. It would exchange what had been formed deep in the sand for whatever lay on the surface.
    The hawks circled overhead screeching their frustration. They knew what was happening. Any desert creature would know.
    And I am a desert creature, Kynes thought. You see me, Father? I am a desert creature.
    He felt the bubble lift him, felt it break and the dust whirlpool engulf him, dragging him down into cool darkness. For a moment, the sensation of coolness and the moisture were blessed relief. Then, as his planet killed him, it occurred to Kynes that his father and all the other scientists were wrong, that the most persistent principles of the universe were accident and error.
    Even the hawks could appreciate these facts.

Prophecy and prescience--How can they be put to the test in the face of the unanswered questions? Consider: How much is actual prediction of the "waveform" (as Muad'Dib referred to his vision-image) and how much is the prophet shaping the future to fit the prophecy? What of the harmonics inherent in the act of prophecy? Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of weakness, a fault or cleavage that he may shatter with words or decisions as a diamond-cutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife?

-"Private Reflections on Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    "Get their water," the man calling out of the night had said. And Paul fought down his fear, glanced at his mother. His trained eyes saw her readiness for battle, the waiting whipsnap of her muscles.
    "It would be regrettable should we have to destroy you out of hand," the voice above them said.
    That's the one who spoke to us first, Jessica thought. There are at least two of them--one to our right and one on our left.
    "Cignoro hrobosa sukares hin mange la pchagavas doi me kamavas na beslas lele pal hrobas!" 
    It was the man to their right calling out across the basin.
    To Paul, the words were gibberish, but out of her Bene Gesserit training, Jessica recognized the speech. It was Chakobsa, one of the ancient hunting languages, and the man above them was saying that perhaps these were the strangers they sought.
    In the sudden silence that followed the calling voice, the hoop-wheel face of the second moon--faintly ivory blue--rolled over the rocks across the basin, bright and peering.
    Scrambling sounds came from the rocks--above and to both sides . . . dark motions in the moonlight. Many figures flowed through the shadows.
    A whole troop! Paul thought with a sudden pang.
    A tall man in a mottled burnoose stepped in front of Jessica. His mouth baffle was thrown aside for clear speech, revealing a heavy beard in the sidelight of the moon, but face and eyes were hidden in the overhang of his hood.
    "What have we here--jinn or human?" he asked.
    And Jessica heard the true-banter in his voice, she allowed herself a faint hope. This was the voice of command, the voice that had first shocked them with its intrusion from the night. 
    "Human, I warrant," the man said.
    Jessica sensed rather than saw the knife hidden in a fold of the man's robe. She permitted herself one bitter regret that she and Paul had no shields.
    "Do you also speak?" the man asked.
    Jessica put all the royal arrogance at her command into her manner and voice. Reply was urgent, but she had not heard enough of this man to be certain she had a register on his culture and weaknesses.
    "Who comes on us like criminals out of the night?" she demanded.
    The burnoose-hooded head showed tension in a sudden twist, then slow relaxation that revealed much. The man had good control.
    Paul shifted away from his mother to separate them as targets and give each of them a clearer arena of action.
    The hooded head turned at Paul's movement, opening a wedge of face to moonlight. Jessica saw a sharp nose, one glinting eye--dark, so dark the eye, without any white in it--a heavy brown and upturned mustache.
    "A likely cub," the man said. "If you're fugitives from the Harkonnens, it may be you're welcome among us. What is it, boy?"
    The possibilities flashed through Paul's mind: A trick? A fact? Immediate decision was needed.
    "Why should you welcome fugitives?" he demanded.
    "A child who thinks and speaks like a man," the tall man said. "Well, now, to answer your question, my young wali, I am one who does not pay the fai, the water tribute, to the Harkonnens. That is why I might welcome a fugitive."
    He knows who we are, Paul thought. There's concealment in his voice.
    "I am Stilgar, the Fremen," the tall man said. "Does that speed your tongue, boy?"
    It is the same voice, Paul thought. And he remembered the Council with this man seeking the body of a friend slain by the Harkonnens.
    "I know you, Stilgar," Paul said. "I was with my father in Council when you came for the water of your friend. You took away with you my father's man, Duncan Idaho--an exchange of friends." 
    "And Idaho abandoned us to return to his Duke," Stilgar said.
    Jessica heard the shading of disgust in his voice, held herself prepared for attack.
    The voice from the rocks above them called: "We waste time here, Stil."
    "This is the Duke's son," Stilgar barked. "He's certainly the one Liet told us to seek." 
    "But . . . a child, Stil."
    "The Duke was a man and this lad used a thumper," Stilgar said. "That was a brave crossing he made in the path of shai-hulud. " 
    And Jessica heard him excluding her from his thoughts. Had he already passed sentence?
    "We haven't time for the test," the voice above them protested. 
    "Yet he could be the Lisan al-Gaib," Stilgar said. 
    He's looking for an omen! Jessica thought. 
    "But the woman," the voice above them said. 
    Jessica readied herself anew. There had been death in that voice. 
    "Yes, the woman," Stilgar said. "And her water." 
    "You know the law," said the voice from the rocks. "Ones who cannot live with the desert--" 
    "Be quiet," Stilgar said. "Times change." 
    "Did Liet command this?" asked the voice from the rocks.
    "You heard the voice of the cielago, Jamis," Stilgar said. "Why do you press me?"
    And Jessica thought: Cielago! the clue of the tongue opened wide avenues of understanding: this was the language of Ilm and Fiqh, and cielago meant bat, a small flying mammal. Voice of the cielago: they had received a distrans message to seek Paul and herself.
    "I but remind you of your duties, friend Stilgar," said the voice above them.
    "My duty is the strength of the tribe," Stilgar said. "That is my only duty. I need no one to remind me of it. This child-man interests me. He is full-fleshed. He has lived on much water. He has lived away from the father sun. He has not the eyes of the ibad. Yet he does not speak or act like a weakling of the pans. Nor did his father. How can this be?"
    "We cannot stay out here all night arguing," said the voice from the rocks. "If a patrol--" 
    "I will not tell you again, Jamis, to be quiet," Stilgar said.
    The man above them remained silent, but Jessica heard him moving, crossing by a leap over a defile and working his way down to the basin floor on their left.
    "The voice of the cielago suggested there'd be value to us in saving you two," Stilgar said. "I can see possibility in this strong boy-man: he is young and can learn. But what of yourself, woman?" He stared at Jessica.
    I have his voice and pattern registered now, Jessica thought. I could control him with a word, but he's a strong man . . . worth much more to us unblunted and with full freedom of action. We shall see.
    "I am the mother of this boy," Jessica said. "In part, his strength which you admire is the product of my training."
    "The strength of a woman can be boundless," Stilgar said. "Certain it is in a Reverend Mother. Are you a Reverend Mother?" 
    For the moment, Jessica put aside the implications of the question, answered truthfully, "No." 
    "Are you trained in the ways of the desert?" 
    "No, but many consider my training valuable." 
    "We make our own judgments on value," Stilgar said. 
    "Every man has the right to his own judgments," she said.
    "It is well that you see the reason," Stilgar said. "We cannot dally here to test you, woman. Do you understand? We'd not want your shade to plague us. I will take the boy-man, your son, and he shall have my countenance, sanctuary in my tribe. But for you, woman--you understand there is nothing personal in this? It is the rule, Istislah, in the general interest. Is that not enough?" 
    Paul took a half-step forward. "What are you talking about?" 
    Stilgar flicked a glance across Paul, but kept his attention on Jessica. "Unless you've been deep-trained from childhood to live here, you could bring destruction onto an entire tribe. It is the law, and we cannot carry useless . . . "
    Jessica's motion started as a slumping, deceptive faint to the ground. It was the obvious thing for a weak outworlder to do, and the obvious slows an opponent's reactions. It takes an instant to interpret a known thing when that thing is exposed as something unknown. She shifted as she saw his right shoulder drop to bring a weapon within the folds of his robe to bear on her new position. A turn, a slash of her arm, a whirling of mingled robes, and she was against the rocks with the man helpless in front of her.
    At his mother's first movement, Paul backed two steps. As she attacked, he dove for shadows. A bearded man rose up in his path, half-crouched, lunging forward with a weapon in one hand. Paul took the man beneath the sternum with a straight-hand jab, sidestepped and chopped the base of his neck, relieving him of the weapon as he fell.
    Then Paul was into the shadows, scrambling upward among the rocks, the weapon tucked into his waist sash. He had recognized it in spite of its unfamiliar shape--a projectile weapon, and that said many things about this place, another clue that shields were not used here.
    They will concentrate on my mother and that Stilgar fellow. She can handle him. I must get to a safe vantage point where I can threaten them and give her time to escape.
    There came a chorus of sharp spring-clicks from the basin. Projectiles whined off the rocks around him. One of them flicked his robe. He squeezed around a corner in the rocks, found himself in a narrow vertical crack, began inching upward--his back against one side, his feet against the other--slowly, as silently as he could.
    The roar of Stilgar's voice echoed up to him: "Get back, you wormheaded lice! She'll break my neck if you come near!" 
    A voice out of the basin said: "The boy got away, Stil. What are we--"
    "Of course he got away, you sand-brained . . . Ugh-h-h! Easy, woman!" 
    "Tell them to stop hunting my son," Jessica said. 
    "They've stopped, woman. He got away as you intended him to. Great gods below! Why didn't you say you were a weirding woman and a fighter?"
    "Tell your men to fall back," Jessica said. "Tell them to go out into the basin where I can see them . . . and you'd better believe that I know how many of them there are."
    And she thought: This is the delicate moment, but if this man is as sharp-minded as I think him, we have a chance.
    Paul inched his way upward, found a narrow ledge on which he could rest and look down into the basin. Stilgar's voice came up to him.
    "And if I refuse? How can you . . . ugh-h-h! Leave be, woman! We mean no harm to you, now. Great gods! If you can do this to the strongest of us, you're worth ten times your weight of water." 
    Now, the test of reason, Jessica thought. She said: "You ask after the Lisan al-Gaib."
    "You could be the folk of the legend," he said, "but I'll believe that when it's been tested. All I know now is that you came here with that stupid Duke who . . . Aiee-e-e! Woman! I care not if you kill me! He was honorable and brave, but it was stupid to put himself in the way of the Harkonnen fist!" 
    Silence.
    Presently, Jessica said: "He had no choice, but we'll not argue it. Now, tell that man of yours behind the bush over there to stop trying to bring his weapon to bear on me, or I'll rid the universe of you and take him next." 
    "You there!" Stilgar roared. "Do as she says!" 
    "But, Stil--"
    "Do as she says, you wormfaced, crawling, sand-brained piece of lizard turd! Do it or I'll help her dismember you! Can't you see the worth of this woman?"
    The man at the bush straightened from his partial concealment, lowered his weapon.
    "He has obeyed," Stilgar said.
    "Now," Jessica said, "explain clearly to your people what it is you wish of me. I want no young hothead to make a foolish mistake."
    "When we slip into the villages and towns we must mask our origin, blend with the pan and graben folk," Stilgar said. "We carry no weapons, for the crysknife is sacred. But you, woman, you have the weirding ability of battle. We'd only heard of it and many doubted, but one cannot doubt what he sees with his own eyes. You mastered an armed Fremen. This is a weapon no search could expose."
    There was a stirring in the basin as Stilgar's words sank home. 
    "And if I agree to teach you the . . . weirding way?" 
    "My countenance for you as well as your son." 
    "How can we be sure of the truth in your promise?" 
    Stilgar's voice lost some of its subtle undertone of reasoning, took on an edge of bitterness. "Out here, woman, we carry no paper for contracts. We make no evening promises to be broken at dawn. When a man says a thing, that's the contract. As leader of my people, I've put them in bond to my word. Teach us this weirding way and you have sanctuary with us as long as you wish. Your water shall mingle with our water." 
    "Can you speak for all Fremen?" Jessica asked.
    "In time, that may be. But only my brother, Liet, speaks for all Fremen. Here, I promise only secrecy. My people will not speak of you to any other sietch. The Harkonnens have returned to Dune in force and your Duke is dead. It is said that you two died in a Mother storm. The hunter does not seek dead game."
    There's safety in that, Jessica thought. But these people have good communications and a message could be sent. 
    "I presume there was a reward offered for us," she said.
    Stilgar remained silent, and she could almost see the thoughts turning over in his head, sensing the shifts of his muscles beneath her hands.
    Presently, he said: "I will say it once more: I've given the tribe's word-bond. My people know your worth to us now. What could the Harkonnens give us? Our freedom? Hah! no, you are the taqwa, that which buys us more than all the spice in the Harkonnen coffers."
    "Then I shall teach you my way of battle," Jessica said, and she sensed the unconscious ritual-intensity of her own words. 
    "Now, will you release me?"
    "So be it," Jessica said. She released her hold on him, stepped aside in full view of the bank in the basin. This is the test-mashed, she thought. But Paul must know about them even if I die for his knowledge.
    In the waiting silence, Paul inched forward to get a better view of where his mother stood. As he moved, he heard heavy breathing, suddenly stilled, above him in the vertical crack of the rock, and sensed a faint shadow there outlined against the stars.
    Stilgar's voice came up from the basin: "You, up there! Stop hunting the boy. He'll come down presently."
    The voice of a young boy or a girl sounded from the darkness above Paul: "But, Stil, he can't be far from--"
    "I said leave him be, Chani! You spawn of a lizard!" 
    There came a whispered imprecation from above Paul and a low voice: "Call me spawn of a lizard!" But the shadow pulled back out of view.
    Paul returned his attention to the basin, picking out the gray-shadowed movement of Stilgar beside his mother.
    "Come in, all of you," Stilgar called. He turned to Jessica. "And now I'll ask you how we may be certain you'll fulfill your half of our bargain? You're the one's lived with papers and empty contracts and such as--"
    "We of the Bene Gesserit don't break our vows any more than you do," Jessica said.
    There was a protracted silence, then a multiple hissing of voices: "A Bene Gesserit witch!"
    Paul brought his captured weapon from his sash, trained it on the dark figure of Stilgar, but the man and his companions remained immobile, staring at Jessica. 
    "It is the legend," someone said.
    "It was said that the Shadout Mapes gave this report on you," Stilgar said. "But a thing so important must be tested. If you are the Bene Gesserit of the legend whose son will lead us to paradise . . . " He shrugged.
    Jessica sighed, thinking: So our Missionaria Protectiva even planted religious safety valves all through this hell hole. Ah, well . . . it'll help, and that's what it was meant to do.
    She said: "The seeress who brought you the legend, she gave it under the binding of karama and ijaz, the miracle and the inimitability of the prophecy--this I know. Do you wish a sign?"
    His nostrils flared in the moonlight. "We cannot tarry for the rites," he whispered.
    Jessica recalled a chart Kynes had shown her while arranging emergency escape routes. How long ago it seemed. There had been a place called "Sietch Tabr" on the chart and beside it the notation: "Stilgar." 
    "Perhaps when we get to Sietch Tabr," she said.
    The revelation shook him, and Jessica thought: If only he knew the tricks we use! She must've been good, that Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva. These Fremen are beautifully prepared to believe in us.
    Stilgar shifted uneasily. "We must go now." 
    She nodded, letting him know that they left with her permission. 
    He looked up at the cliff almost directly at the rock ledge where Paul crouched. "You there, lad: you may come down now." He returned his attention to Jessica, spoke with an apologetic tone: "Your son made an incredible amount of noise climbing. He has much to learn lest he endanger us all, but he's young." 
    "No doubt we have much to teach each other," Jessica said. "Meanwhile, you'd best see to your companion out there. My noisy son was a bit rough in disarming him." 
    Stilgar whirled, his hood flapping. "Where?" 
    "Beyond those bushes." She pointed.
    Stilgar touched two of his men. "See to it." He glanced at his companions, identifying them. "Jamis is missing." He turned to Jessica. "Even your cub knows the weirding way." 
    "And you'll notice that my son hasn't stirred from up there as you ordered," Jessica said.
    The two men Stilgar had sent returned supporting a third who stumbled and gasped between them. Stilgar gave them a flicking glance, returned his attention to Jessica. "The son will take only your orders, eh? Good. He knows discipline." 
    "Paul, you may come down now," Jessica said.
    Paul stood up, emerging into moonlight above his concealing cleft, slipped the Fremen weapon back into his sash. As he turned, another figure arose from the rocks to face him.
    In the moonlight and reflection off gray stone, Paul saw a small figure in Fremen robes, a shadowed face peering out at him from the hood, and the muzzle of one of the projectile weapons aimed at him from a fold of robe.
    "I am Chani, daughter of Liet." 
    The voice was lilting, half filled with laughter.
    "I would not have permitted you to harm my companions," she said.
    Paul swallowed. The figure in front of him turned into the moon's path and he saw an elfin face, black pits of eyes. The familiarity of that face, the features out of numberless visions in his earliest prescience, shocked Paul to stillness. He remembered the angry bravado with which he had once described this face-from-a-dream, telling the Reverend Mother Gains Helen Mohiam: "I will meet her." 
    And here was the face, but in no meeting he had ever dreamed.
    "You were as noisy as shai-hulud in a rage," she said. "And you took the most difficult way up here. Follow me; I'll show you an easier way down."
    He scrambled out of the cleft, followed the swirling of her robe across a tumbled landscape. She moved like a gazelle, dancing over the rocks. Paul felt hot blood in his face, was thankful for the darkness.
    That girl! She was like a touch of destiny. He felt caught up on a wave, in tune with a motion that lifted all his spirits. 
    They stood presently amidst the Fremen on the basin floor.
    Jessica turned a wry smile on Paul, but spoke to Stilgar: "This will be a good exchange of teachings. I hope you and your people feel no anger at our violence. It seemed . . . necessary. You were about to . . . make a mistake."
    "To save one from a mistake is a gift of paradise," Stilgar said. He touched his lips with his left hand, lifted the weapon from Paul's waist with the other, tossed it to a companion. "You will have your own maula pistol, lad, when you've earned it."
    Paul started to speak, hesitated, remembering his mother's teaching: "Beginnings are such delicate times. "
    "My son has what weapons he needs," Jessica said. She stared at Stilgar, forcing him to think of how Paul had acquired the pistol.
    Stilgar glanced at the man Paul had subdued--Jamis. The man stood at one side, head lowered, breathing heavily. "You are a difficult woman," Stilgar said. He held out his left hand to a companion, snapped his fingers. "Kushti bakka te." 
    More Chakobsa, Jessica thought.
    The companion pressed two squares of gauze into Stilgar's hand. Stilgar ran them through his fingers, fixed one around Jessica's neck beneath her hood, fitted the other around Paul's neck in the same way.
    "Now you wear the kerchief of the bakka," he said. "If we become separated, you will be recognized as belonging to Stilgar's sietch. We will talk of weapons another time."
    He moved out through his band now, inspecting them, giving Paul's Fremkit pack to one of his men to carry.
    Bakka, Jessica thought, recognizing the religious term: bakka--the weeper. She sensed how the symbolism of the kerchiefs united this band. Why should weeping unite them? she asked herself.
    Stilgar came to the young girl who had embarrassed Paul, said: "Chani, take the child-man under your wing. Keep him out of trouble." 
    Chani touched Paul's arm. "Come along, child-man." 
    Paul hid the anger in his voice, said: "My name is Paul. It were well you--"
    "We'll give you a name, manling," Stilgar said, "in the time of the mihna, at the test of aql."
    The test of reason, Jessica translated. The sudden need of Paul's ascendancy overrode all other consideration, and she barked, "My son's been tested with the gom jabbar!"
    In the stillness that followed, she knew she had struck to the heart of them.
    "There's much we don't know of each other," Stilgar said. "But we tarry overlong. Day-sun mustn't find us in the open." He crossed to the man Paul had struck down, said, "Jamis, can you travel?"
    A grunt answered him. "Surprised me, he did. 'Twas an accident. I can travel."
    "No accident," Stilgar said. "I'll hold you responsible with Chani for the lad's safety, Jamis. These people have my countenance."
    Jessica stared at the man, Jamis. His was the voice that had argued with Stilgar from the rocks. His was the voice with death in it. And Stilgar had seen fit to reinforce his order with this Jamis.
    Stilgar flicked a testing glance across the group, motioned two men out. "Larus and Farrukh, you are to hide our tracks. See that we leave no trace. Extra care--we have two with us who've not been trained." He turned, hand upheld and aimed across the basin. "In squad line with flankers--move out. We must be at Cave of the Ridges before dawn."
    Jessica fell into step beside Stilgar, counting heads. There were forty Fremen--she and Paul made it forty-two. And she thought: They travel as a military company--even the girl, Chani.
    Paul took a place in the line behind Chani. He had put down the black feeling at being caught by the girl. In his mind now was the memory called up by his mother's barked reminder: "My son's been tested with the gom jabbar!" He found that his hand tingled with remembered pain.
    "Watch where you go," Chani hissed. "Do not brush against a bush lest you leave a thread to show our passage." 
    Paul swallowed, nodded.
    Jessica listened to the sounds of the troop, hearing her own footsteps and Paul's, marveling at the way the Fremen moved. They were forty people crossing the basin with only the sounds natural to the place--ghostly feluccas, their robes flitting through the shadows. Their destination was Sietch Tabr--Stilgar's sietch.
    She turned the word over in her mind; sietch. It was a Chakobsa word, unchanged from the old hunting language out of countless centuries. Sietch: a meeting place in time of danger. The profound implications of the word and the language were just beginning to register with her after the tension of their encounter.
    "We move well," Stilgar said. "With, Shai-hulud's favor, we'll reach Cave of the Ridges before dawn."
    Jessica nodded, conserving her strength, sensing the terrible fatigue she held at bay by force of will . . . and, she admitted it: by the force of elation. Her mind focused on the value of this troop, seeing what was revealed here about the Fremen culture.
    All of them, she thought, an entire culture trained to military order. What a priceless thing is here for an outcast Duke!

    They approached Cave of the Ridges at dawnbreak, moving through a split in the basin wall so narrow they had to turn sideways to negotiate it. Jessica saw Stilgar detach guards in the thin dawnlight, saw them for a moment as they began their scrambling climb up the cliff.
    Paul turned his head upward as he walked, seeing the tapestry of this planet cut in cross section where the narrow cleft gaped toward gray-blue sky.
    Chani pulled at his robe to hurry him, said: "Quickly. It is already light."
    "The men who climbed above us, where are they going?" Paul whispered.
    "The first daywatch," she said. "Hurry now!" 
    A guard left outside, Paul thought. Wise. But it would've been wiser still for us to approach this place in separate bands. Less chance of losing the whole troop. He paused in the thought, realizing that this was guerrilla thinking, and he remembered his father's fear that the Atreides might become a guerrilla house. 
    "Faster," Chani whispered.
    Paul sped his steps, hearing the swish of robes behind. And he thought of the words of the sirat from Yueh's tiny 0.C. Bible.
    "Paradise on my right, Hell on my left and the Angel of Death behind." He rolled the quotation in his mind.
    They rounded a corner where the passage widened. Stilgar stood at one side motioning them into a low hole that opened at right angles.
    "Quickly!" he hissed. "We're like rabbits in a cage if a patrol catches us here."
    Paul bent for the opening, followed Chani into a cave illuminated by thin gray light from somewhere ahead. 
    "You can stand up," she said.
    He straightened, studied the place: a deep and wide area with domed ceiling that curved away just out of a man's handreach. The troop spread out through shadows. Paul saw his mother come up on one side, saw her examine their companions. And he noted how she failed to blend with the Fremen even though her garb was identical. The way she moved--such a sense of power and grace.
    "Find a place to rest and stay out of the way, child-man," Chani said. "Here's food." She pressed two leaf-wrapped morsels into his hand. They reeked of spice.
    Stilgar came up behind Jessica, called an order to a group on the left. "Get the doorseal in place and see to moisture security." He turned to another Fremen: "Lemil, get glowglobes." He took Jessica's arm. "I wish to show you something, weirding woman." He led her around a curve of rock toward the light source.
    Jessica found herself looking out across the wide lip of another opening to the cave, an opening high in a cliff wall--looking out across another basin about ten or twelve kilometers wide. The basin was shielded by high rock walls. Sparse clumps of plant growth were scattered around it.
    As she looked at the dawn-gray basin, the sun lifted over the far escarpment illuminating a biscuit-colored landscape of rocks and sand. And she noted how the sun of Arrakis appeared to leap over the horizon.
    It's because we want to hold it back, she thought. Night is safer than day. There came over her then a longing for a rainbow in this place that would never see rain. I must suppress such longings, she thought. They're a weakness. I no longer can afford weaknesses.
    Stilgar gripped her arm, pointed across the basin. "There! There you see proper Druses."
    She looked where he pointed, saw movement: people on the basin floor scattering at the daylight into the shadows of the opposite cliffwall. In spite of the distance, their movements were plain in the clear air. She lifted her binoculars from beneath her robe, focused the oil lenses on the distant people. Kerchiefs fluttered like a flight of multicolored butterflies.
    "That is home," Stilgar said. "We will be there this night." He stared across the basin, tugging at his mustache. "My people stayed out overlate working. That means there are no patrols about. I'll signal them later and they'll prepare for us."
    "Your people show good discipline," Jessica said. She lowered the binoculars, saw that Stilgar was looking at them.
    "They obey the preservation of the tribe," he said. "It is the way we choose among us for a leader. The leader is the one who is strongest, the one who brings water and security." He lifted his attention to her face.
    She returned his stare, noted the whiteless eyes, the stained eyepits, the dust-rimmed beard and mustache, the line of the catchtube curving down from his nostrils into his stillsuit.
    "Have I compromised your leadership by besting you, Stilgar?" she asked.
    "You did not call me out," he said.
    "It's important that a leader keep the respect of his troop," she said.
    "Isn't a one of those sandlice I cannot handle," Stilgar said. "When you bested me, you bested us all. Now, they hope to learn from you . . . the weirding way . . . and some are curious to see if you intend to call me out."
    She weighed the implications. "By besting you in formal battle?"
    He nodded. "I'd advise you against this because they'd not follow you. You're not of the sand. They saw this in our night's passage." 
    "Practical people," she said.
    "True enough." He glanced at the basin. "We know our needs. But not many are thinking deep thoughts now this close to home. We've been out overlong arranging to deliver our spice quota to the free traders for the cursed Guild . . . may their faces be forever black."
    Jessica stopped in the act of turning away from him, looked back up into his face. "The Guild? What has the Guild to do with your spice?"
    "It's Liet's command," Stilgar said. "We know the reason, but the taste of it sours us. We bribe the Guild with a monstrous payment in spice to keep our skies clear of satellites and such that none may spy what we do to the face of Arrakis." 
    She weighed out her words, remembering that Paul had said this must be the reason Arrakeen skies were clear of satellites. "And what is it you do to the face of Arrakis that must not be seen?"
    "We change it . . . slowly but with certainty . . . to make it fit for human life. Our generation will not see it, nor our children nor our children's children nor the grandchildren of their children . . . but it will come." He stared with veiled eyes out over the basin. "Open water and tall green plants and people walking freely without stillsuits."
    So that's the dream of this Liet-Kynes, she thought. And she said: "Bribes are dangerous; they have a way of growing larger and larger."
    "They grow," he said, "but the slow way is the safe way." 
    Jessica turned, looked out over the basin, trying to see it the way Stilgar was seeing it in his imagination. She saw only the grayed mustard stain of distant rocks and a sudden hazy motion in the sky above the cliffs.
    "Ah-h-h-h," Stilgar said.
    She thought at first it must be a patrol vehicle, then realized it was a mirage--another landscape hovering over the desert-sand and a distant wavering of greenery and in the middle distance a long worm traveling the surface with what looked like Fremen robes fluttering on its back.
    The mirage faded.
    "It would be better to ride," Stilgar said, "but we cannot permit a maker into this basin. Thus, we must walk again tonight." 
    Maker--their word for worm, she thought.
    She measured the import of his words, the statement that they could not permit a worm into this basin. She knew what she had seen in the mirage--Fremen riding on the back of a giant worm. It took heavy control not to betray her shock at the implications.
    "We must be getting back to the others," Stilgar said. "Else my people may suspect I dally with you. Some already are jealous that my hands tasted your loveliness when we struggled last night in Tuono Basin." 
    "That will be enough of that!" Jessica snapped.
    "No offense," Stilgar said, and his voice was mild. "Women among us are not taken against their will . . . and with you . . . " He shrugged. ". . . even that convention isn't required."
    "You will keep in mind that I was a duke's lady," she said, but her voice was calmer.
    "As you wish," he said. "It's time to seal off this opening, to permit relaxation of stillsuit discipline. My people need to rest in comfort this day. Their families will give them little rest on the morrow."
    Silence fell between them.
    Jessica stared out into the sunlight. She had heard what she had heard in Stilgar's voice--the unspoken offer of more than his countenance. Did he need a wife? She realized she could step into that place with him. It would be one way to end conflict over tribal leadership--female properly aligned with male.
    But what of Paul then? Who could tell yet what rules of parenthood prevailed here? And what of the unborn daughter she had carried these few weeks? What of a dead Duke's daughter? And she permitted herself to face fully the significance of this other child growing within her, to see her own motives in permitting the conception. She knew what it was--she had succumbed to that profound drive shared by all creatures who are faced with death--the drive to seek immortality through progeny. The fertility drive of the species had overpowered them.
    Jessica glanced at Stilgar, saw that he was studying her, waiting. A daughter born here to a woman wed to such a one as this man--what would be the fate of such a daughter? she asked herself. Would he try to limit the necessities that a Bene Gesserit must follow?
    Stilgar cleared his throat and revealed then that he understood some of the questions in her mind. "What is important for a leader is that which makes him a leader. It is the needs of his people. If you teach me your powers, there may come a day when one of us must challenge the other. I would prefer some alternative." 
    "There are several alternatives?" she asked.
    "The Sayyadina," he said. "Our Reverend Mother is old." 
    Their Reverend Mother!
    Before she could probe this, he said: "I do not necessarily offer myself as mate. This is nothing personal, for you are beautiful and desirable. But should you become one of my women, that might lead some of my young men to believe that I'm too much concerned with pleasures of the flesh and not enough concerned with the tribe's needs. Even now they listen to us and watch us." 
    A man who weighs his decisions, who thinks of consequences, she thought.
    "There are those among my young men who have reached the age of wild spirits," he said. "They must be eased through this period. I must leave no great reasons around for them to challenge me. Because I would have to maim and kill among them. This is not the proper course for a leader if it can be avoided with honor. A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob."
    His words, the depth of their awareness, the fact that he spoke as much to her as to those who secretly listened, forced her to reevaluate him.
    He has stature, she thought. Where did he learn such inner balance?
    "The law that demands our form of choosing a leader is a just law," Stilgar said. "But it does not follow that justice is always the thing a people needs. What we truly need now is time to grow and prosper, to spread our force over more land."
    What is his ancestry? she wondered. Whence comes such breeding? She said: "Stilgar, I underestimated you." 
    "Such was my suspicion," he said.
    "Each of us apparently underestimated the other," she said.
    "I should like an end to this," he said. "I should like friendship with you . . . and trust. I should like that respect for each other which grows in the breast without demand for the huddlings of sex." 
    "I understand," she said. 
    "Do you trust me?" 
    "I hear your sincerity."
    "Among us," he said, "the Sayyadina, when they are not the formal leaders, hold a special place of honor. They teach. They maintain the strength of God here." He touched his breast.
    Now I must probe this Reverend Mother mystery, she thought. And she said: "You spoke of your Reverend Mother . . . and I've heard words of legend and prophecy."
    "It is said that a Bene Gesserit and her offspring hold the key to our future," he said.
    "Do you believe I am that one."
    She watched his face, thinking; The young reed dies so easily. Beginnings are times of such great peril. 
    "We do not know," he said.
    She nodded, thinking: He's an honorable man. He wants a sign from me, but he'll not tip fate by telling me the sign.
    Jessica turned her head, stared down into the basin at the golden shadows, the purple shadows, the vibrations of dust-mote air across the lip of their cave. Her mind was filled suddenly with feline prudence. She knew the cant of the Missionaria Protectiva, knew how to adapt the techniques of legend and fear and hope to her emergency needs, but she sensed wild changes here . . . as though someone had been in among these Fremen and capitalized on the Missionaria Protectiva's imprint.
    Stilgar cleared his throat.
    She sensed his impatience, knew that the day moved ahead and men waited to seal off this opening. This was a time for boldness on her part, and she realized what she needed: some dar al-hikman, some school of translation that would give her . . . 
    "Adab," she whispered.
    Her mind felt as though it had rolled over within her. She recognized the sensation with a quickening of pulse. Nothing in all the Bene Gesserit training carried such a signal of recognition. It could be only the adab, the demanding memory that comes upon you of itself. She gave herself up to it, allowing the words to flow from her.
    "Ibn qirtaiba," she said, "as far as the spot where the dust ends." She stretched out an arm from her robe, seeing Stilgar's eyes go wide. She heard a rustling of many robes in the background. "I see a . . . Fremen with the book of examples," she intoned. "He reads to al-Lat, the sun whom he defied and subjugated. He reads to the Sadus of the Trial and this is what he reads;

"Mine enemies are like green blades eaten down 
That did stand in the path of the tempest. 
Hast thou not seen what our Lord did? 
He sent the pestilence among them 
That did lay schemes against us.
They are like birds scattered by the huntsman. 
Their schemes are like pellets of poison 
That every mouth rejects."

    A trembling passed through her. She dropped her arm.
    Back to her from the inner cave's shadows came a whispered response of many voices: "Their works have been overturned." 
    "The fire of God mount over thy heart," she said. And she thought: Now, it goes in the proper channel. 
    "The fire of God set alight," came the response. 
    She nodded. "Thine enemies shall fall," she said. 
    "Bi-la kaifa," they answered.
    In the sudden hush, Stilgar bowed to her. "Sayyadina," he said. "If the Shai-hulud grant, then you may yet pass within to become a Reverend Mother."
    Pass within, she thought. An odd way of putting it. But the rest of it fitted into the cant well enough. And she felt a cynical bitterness at what she had done. Our Missionaria Protectiva seldom fails. A place was prepared for us in this wilderness. The prayer of the salat has carved out our hiding place. Now . . . I must play the part of Auliya, the Friend of God . . . Sayyadina to rogue peoples who've been so heavily imprinted with our Bene Gesserit soothsay they even call their chief priestesses Reverend Mothers.
    Paul stood beside Chani in the shadows of the inner cave. He could still taste the morsel she had fed him--bird flesh and grain bound with spice honey and encased in a leaf. In tasting it he had realized he never before had eaten such a concentration of spice essence and there had been a moment of fear. He knew what this essence could do to him--the spice change that pushed his mind into prescient awareness.
    "Bi-la kaifa," Chani whispered.
    He looked at her, seeing the awe with which the Fremen appeared to accept his mother's words. Only the man called Jamis seemed to stand aloof from the ceremony, holding himself apart with arms folded across his breast.
    "Duy yakha bin mange," Chani whispered. "Duy punra bin mange. I have two eyes. I have two feet." 
    And she stared at Paul with a look of wonder.
    Paul took a deep breath, trying to still the tempest within him. His mother's words had locked onto the working of the spice essence, and he had felt her voice rise and fall within him like the shadows of an open fire. Through it all, he had sensed the edge of cynicism in her--he knew her so well!--but nothing could stop this thing that had begun with a morsel of food. 
    Terrible purpose!
    He sensed it, the race consciousness that he could not escape. There was the sharpened clarity, the inflow of data, the cold precision of his awareness. He sank to the floor, sitting with his back against rock, giving himself up to it. Awareness flowed into that timeless stratum where he could view time, sensing the available paths, the winds of the future . . . the winds of the past: the one-eyed vision of the past, the one-eyed vision of the present and the one-eyed vision of the future--all combined in a trinocular vision that permitted him to see time-become-space.
    There was danger, he felt, of overrunning himself, and he had to hold onto his awareness of the present, sensing the blurred deflection of experience, the flowing moment, the continual solidification of that-which-is into the perpetual-was.
    In grasping the present, he felt for the first time the massive steadiness of time's movement everywhere complicated by shifting currents, waves, surges, and countersurges, like surf against rocky cliffs. It gave him a new understanding of his prescience, and he saw the source of blind time, the source of error in it, with an immediate sensation of fear.
    The prescience, he realized, was an illumination that incorporated the limits of what it revealed--at once a source of accuracy and meaningful error. A kind of Heisenberg indeterminacy intervened: the expenditure of energy that revealed what he saw, changed what he saw.
    And what he saw was a time nexus within this cave, a boiling of possibilities focused here, wherein the most minute action--the wink of an eye, a careless word, a misplaced grain of sand--moved a gigantic lever across the known universe. He saw violence with the outcome subject to so many variables that his slightest movement created vast shiftings in the pattern.
    The vision made him want to freeze into immobility, but this, too, was action with its consequences.
    The countless consequences--lines fanned out from this cave, and along most of these consequence-lines he saw his own dead body with blood flowing from a gaping knife wound.

My father, the Padishah Emperor, was 72 yet looked no more than 35 the year he encompassed the death of Duke Leto and gave Arrakis back to the Harkonnens. He seldom appeared in public wearing other than a Sardaukar uniform and a Burseg's black helmet with the imperial lion in gold upon its crest. The uniform was an open reminder of where his power lay. He was not always that blatant, though. When he wanted, he could radiate charm and sincerity, but I often wonder in these later days if anything about him was as it seemed. I think now he was a man fighting constantly to escape the bars of an invisible cage. You must remember that he was an emperor, father-head of a dynasty that reached back into the dimmest history. But we denied him a legal son. Was this not the most terrible defeat a ruler ever suffered? My mother obeyed her Sister Superiors where the Lady Jessica disobeyed. Which of them was the stronger? History already has answered.
-"In My Father's House" by the Princess Irulan

    Jessica awakened in cave darkness, sensing the stir of Fremen around her, smelling the acrid stillsuit odor. Her inner timesense told her it would soon be night outside, but the cave remained in blackness, shielded from the desert by the plastic hoods that trapped their body moisture within this space.
    She realized that she had permitted herself the utterly relaxing sleep of great fatigue, and this suggested something of her own unconscious assessment on personal security within Stilgar's troop. She turned in the hammock that had been fashioned of her robe, slipped her feet to the rock floor and into her desert boots.
    I must remember to fasten the boots slip-fashion to help my stillsuit's pumping action, she thought. There are so many things to remember.
    She could still taste their morning meal--the morsel of bird flesh and grain bound within a leaf with spice honey--and it came to her that the use of time was turned around here: night was the day of activity and day was the time of rest. 
    Night conceals; night is safest.
    She unhooked her robe from its hammock pegs in a rock alcove, fumbled with the fabric in the dark until she found the top, slipped into it.
    How to get a message out to the Bene Gesserit? she wondered. They would have to be told of the two strays in Arrakeen sanctuary.
    Glowglobes came alight farther into the cave. She saw people moving there, Paul among them already dressed and with his hood thrown back to reveal the aquiline Atreides profile.
    He had acted so strangely before they retired, she thought. Withdrawn. He was like one come back from the dead, not yet fully aware of his return, his eyes half shut and glassy with the inward stare. It made her think of his warning about the spice-impregnated diet: addictive.
    Are there side effects? she wondered. He said it had something to do with his prescient faculty, but he has been strangely silent about what he sees.
    Stilgar came from shadows to her right, crossed to the group beneath the glowglobes. She marked how he fingered his beard and the watchful, cat-stalking look of him.
    Abrupt fear shot through Jessica as her senses awakened to the tensions visible in the people gathered around Paul--the stiff movements, the ritual positions.
    "They have my countenance!" Stilgar rumbled.
    Jessica recognized the man Stilgar confronted--Jamis! She saw then the rage in Jamis--the tight set of his shoulders.
    Jamis, the man Paul bested! she thought. 
    "You know the rule, Stilgar," Jamis said.
    "Who knows it better?" Stilgar asked, and she heard the tone of placation in his voice, the attempt to smooth something over. 
    "I choose the combat," Jamis growled.
    Jessica sped across the cave, grasped Stilgar's arm. "What is this?" she asked.
    "It is the amtal rule," Stilgar said. "Jamis is demanding the right to test your part in the legend."
    "She must be championed," Jamis said. "If her champion wins, that's the truth in it. But it's said . . . " He glanced across the press of people. " . . . that she'd need no champion from the Fremen--which can mean only that she brings her own champion." 
    He's talking of single combat with Paul! Jessica thought.
    She released Stilgar's arm, took a half-step forward. "I'm always my own champion," she said. "The meaning's simple enough for . . . "
    "You'll not tell us our ways!" Jamis snapped. "Not without more proof than I've seen. Stilgar could've told you what to say last morning. He could've filled your mind full of the coddle and you could've bird-talked it to us, hoping to make a false way among us."
    I can take him, Jessica thought, but that might conflict with the way they interpret the legend. And again she wondered at the way the Missionaria Protectiva's work had been twisted on this planet.
    Stilgar looked at Jessica, spoke in a low voice but one designed to carry to the crowd's fringe. "Jamis is one to hold a grudge, Sayyadina. Your son bested him and--"
    "It was an accident!" Jamis roared. "There was witch-force at Tuono Basin and I'll prove it now!"
    " . . . and I've bested him myself," Stilgar continued. "He seeks by this tahaddi challenge to get back at me as well. There's too much of violence in Jamis for him ever to make a good leader--too much ghafla, the distraction. He gives his mouth to the rules and his heart to the sarfa, the turning away. No, he could never make a good leader. I've preserved him this long because he's useful in a fight as such, but when he gets this carving anger on him he's dangerous to his own society." 
    "Stilgar-r-r-r!" Jamis rumbled.
    And Jessica saw what Stilgar was doing, trying to enrage Jamis, to take the challenge away from Paul.
    Stilgar faced Jamis, and again Jessica heard the soothing in the rumbling voice. "Jamis, he's but a boy. He's--"
    "You named him a man," Jamis said. "His mother says he's been through the gom jabbar. He's full-fleshed and with a surfeit of water. The ones who carried their pack say there's literjons of water in it. Literjons! And us sipping our catch-pockets the instant they show dewsparkle."
    Stilgar glanced at Jessica. "Is this true? Is there water in your pack?" 
    "Yes." 
    "Literjons of it?" 
    "Two literjons." 
    "What was intended with this wealth?"
    Wealth? she thought. She shook her head, feeling the coldness in his voice.
    "Where I was born, water fell from the sky and ran over the land in wide rivers," she said. "There were oceans of it so broad you could not see the other shore. I've not been trained to your water discipline. I never before had to think of it this way." 
    A sighing gasp arose from the people around them: "Water fell from the sky . . . it ran over the land."
    "Did you know there're those among us who've lost from their catch-pockets by accident and will be in sore trouble before we reach Tabr this night?"
    "How could I know?" Jessica shook her head. "If they're in need, give them water from our pack." 
    "Is that what you intended with this wealth?" 
    "I intended it to save life," she said. 
    "Then we accept your blessing, Sayyadina."
    "You'll not buy us off with water," Jamis growled. "Nor will you anger me against yourself, Stilgar. I see you trying to make me call you out before I've proved my words,"
    Stilgar faced Jamis. "Are you determined to press this fight against a child, Jamis?" His voice was low, venomous. 
    "She must be championed." 
    "Even though she has my countenance?" 
    "I invoke the amtal rule," Jamis said. "It's my right." 
    Stilgar nodded. "Then, if the boy does not carve you down, you'll answer to my knife afterward. And this time I'll not hold back the blade as I've done before." 
    "You cannot do this thing," Jessica said. "Paul's just--" 
    "You must not interfere, Sayyadina," Stilgar said. "Oh, I know you can take me and, therefore, can take anyone among us, but you cannot best us all united. This must be; it is the amtal rule." 
    Jessica fell silent, staring at him in the green light of the glowglobes, seeing the demoniacal stiffness that had taken over his expression. She shifted her attention to Jamis, saw the brooding look to his brows and thought: I should've seen that before. He broods. He's the silent kind, one who works himself up inside. I should've been prepared.
    "If you harm my son," she said, "You'll have me to meet. I call you out now. I'll carve you into a joint of--"
    "Mother." Paul stepped forward, touched her sleeve. "Perhaps if I explain to Jamis how--" 
    "Explain!" Jamis sneered.
    Paul fell silent, staring at the man. He felt no fear of him. Jamis appeared clumsy in his movements and he had fallen so easily in their night encounter on the sand. But Paul still felt the nexus-boiling of this cave, still remembered the prescient visions of himself dead under a knife. There had been so few avenues of escape for him in that vision . . . 
    Stilgar said: "Sayyadina, you must step back now where--" 
    "Stop calling her Sayyadina!" Jamis said. "That's yet to be proved. So she knows the prayer! What's that? Every child among us knows it."
    He has talked enough, Jessica thought. I've the key to him. I could immobilize him with a word. She hesitated. But I cannot stop them all.
    "You will answer to me then," Jessica said, and she pitched her voice in a twisting tone with a little whine in it and a catch at the end. 
    Jamis stared at her, fright visible on his face.
    "I'll teach you agony," she said in the same tone. "Remember that as you fight. You'll have agony such as will make the gom jabbar a happy memory by comparison. You will writhe with your entire--"
    "She tries a spell on me!" Jamis gasped. He put his clenched right fist beside his ear. "I invoke the silence on her!" 
    "So be it then," Stilgar said. He cast a warning glance at Jessica. "If you speak again, Sayyadina, we'll know it's your witchcraft and you'll be forfeit." He nodded for her to step back.
    Jessica felt hands pulling her, helping her back, and she sensed they were not unkindly. She saw Paul being separated from the throng, the elfin-faced Chani whispering in his ear as she nodded toward Jamis.
    A ring formed within the troop. More glowglobes were brought and all of them tuned to the yellow band.
    Jamis stepped into the ring, slipped out of his robe and tossed it to someone in the crowd. He stood there in a cloudy gray slickness of stillsuit that was patched and marked by tucks and gathers. For a moment, he bent with his mouth to his shoulder, drinking from a catchpocket tube. Presently he straightened, peeled off and detached the suit, handed it carefully into the crowd. He stood waiting, clad in loincloth and some tight fabric over his feet, a crysknife in his right hand.
    Jessica saw the girl-child Chani helping Paul, saw her press a crysknife handle into his palm, saw him heft it, testing the weight and balance. And it came to Jessica that Paul had been trained in prana and bindu, the nerve and the fiber--that he had been taught fighting in a deadly school, his teachers men like Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, men who were legends in their own lifetimes. The boy knew the devious ways of the Bene Gesserit and he looked supple and confident.
    But he's only fifteen, she thought. And he has no shield. I must stop this. Somehow, there must be a way to . . . She looked up, saw Stilgar watching her.
    "You cannot stop it," he said. "You must not speak." 
    She put a hand over her mouth, thinking: I've planted fear in Jamis' mind. It'll slow him some . . . perhaps. If I could only pray--truly pray.
    Paul stood alone now just into the ring, clad in the fighting trunks he'd worn under his stillsuit. He held a crysknife in his right hand; his feet were bare against the sand-gritted rock. Idaho had warned him time and again: "When in doubt of your surface, bare feet are best." And there were Chani's words of instruction still in the front of his consciousness: "Jamis turns to the right with his knife after a parry. It's a habit in him we've all seen. And he'll aim for the eyes to catch a blink in which to slash you. And he can fight either hand; took out for a knife shift."
    But strongest in Paul so that he felt it with his entire body was training and the instinctual reaction mechanism that had been hammered into him day after day, hour after hour on the practice floor.
    Gurney Halleck's words were there to remember: "The good knife fighter thinks on point and blade and shearing-guard simultaneously. The point can also cut; the blade can also stab; the shearing-guard can also trap your opponent's blade." 
    Paul glanced at the crysknife. There was no shearing-guard; only the slim round ring of the handle with its raised lips to protect the hand. And even so, he realized that he did not know the breaking tension of this blade, did not even know if it could be broken.
    Jamis began sidling to the right along the edge of the ring opposite Paul.
    Paul crouched, realizing then that he had no shield, but was trained to fighting with its subtle field around him, trained to react on defense with utmost speed while his attack would be timed to the controlled slowness necessary for penetrating the enemy's shield. In spite of constant warning from his trainers not to depend on the shield's mindless blunting of attack speed, he knew that shield-awareness was part of him.
    Jamis called out in ritual challenge: "May thy knife chip and shatter!" 
    This knife will break then, Paul thought.
    He cautioned himself that Jamis also was without shield, but the man wasn't trained to its use, had no shield-fighter inhibitions.
    Paul stared across the ring at Jamis. The man's body looked like knotted whipcord on a dried skeleton. His crysknife shone milky yellow in the light of the glowglobes.
    Fear coursed through Paul. He felt suddenly alone and naked standing in dull yellow light within this ring of people. Prescience had fed his knowledge with countless experiences, hinted at the strongest currents of the future and the strings of decision that guided them, but this was the real-now. This was death hanging on an infinite number of miniscule mischances.
    Anything could tip the future here, he realized. Someone coughing in the troop of watchers, a distraction. A variation in a glowglobe's brilliance, a deceptive shadow. 
    I'm afraid, Paul told himself.
    And he circled warily opposite Jamis, repeating silently to himself the Bene Gesserit litany against fear. "Fear is the mind-killer . . . " It was a cool bath washing over him. He felt muscles untie themselves, become poised and ready.
    "I'll sheath my knife in your blood," Jamis snarled. And in the middle of the last word he pounced. 
    Jessica saw the motion, stifled an outcry.
    Where the man struck there was only empty air and Paul stood now behind Jamis with a clear shot at the exposed back. 
    Now, Paul! Now! Jessica screamed it in her mind.
    Paul's motion was slowly timed, beautifully fluid, but so slow it gave Jamis the margin to twist away, backing and turning to the right.
    Paul withdrew, crouching low. "First, you must find my blood," he said.
    Jessica recognized the shield-fighter timing in her son, and it came over her what a two-edged thing that was. The boy's reactions were those of youth and trained to a peak these people had never seen. But the attack was trained, too, and conditioned by the necessities of penetrating a shield barrier. A shield would repel too fast a blow, admit only the slowly deceptive counter. It needed control and trickery to get through a shield. 
    Does Paul see it? she asked herself. He must!
    Again Jamis attacked, ink-dark eyes glaring, his body a yellow blur under the glowglobes.
    And again Paul slipped away to return too slowly on the attack. 
    And again. 
    And again.
    Each time, Paul's counterblow came an instant late.
    And Jessica saw a thing she hoped Jamis did not see. Paul's defensive reactions were blindingly fast, but they moved each time at the precisely correct angle they would take if a shield were helping deflect part of Jamis' blow.
    "Is your son playing with that poor fool?" Stilgar asked. He waved her to silence before she could respond. "Sorry; you must remain silent."
    Now the two figures on the rock floor circled each other; Jamis with knife hand held far forward and tipped up slightly; Paul crouched with knife held low.
    Again, Jamis pounced, and this time he twisted to the right where Paul had been dodging.
    Instead of faking back and out, Paul met the man's knife hand on the point of his own blade. Then the boy was gone, twisting away to the left and thankful for Chani's warning.
    Jamis backed into the center of the circle, rubbing his knife hand. Blood dripped from the injury for a moment, stopped. His eyes were wide and staring--two blue-black holes--studying Paul with a new wariness in the dull light of the glowglobes. 
    "Ah, that one hurt," Stilgar murmured.
    Paul crouched at the ready and, as he had been trained to do after first blood, called out: "Do you yield?" 
    "Hah!" Jamis cried.
    An angry murmur arose from the troop.
    "Hold!" Stilgar called out. "The lad doesn't know our rule." Then, to Paul: "There can be no yielding in the tahaddi-challenge. Death is the test of it."
    Jessica saw Paul swallow hard. And she thought: He's never killed a man like this . . . in the hot blood of a knife fight. Can he do it?
    Paul circled slowly right, forced by Jamis' movement. The prescient knowledge of the time-boiling variables in this cave came back to plague him now. His new understanding told him there were too many swiftly compressed decisions in this fight for any clear channel ahead to show itself.
    Variable piled on variable--that was why this cave lay as a blurred nexus in his path. It was like a gigantic rock in the flood, creating maelstroms in the current around it.
    "Have an end to it, lad," Stilgar muttered. "Don't play with him." 
    Paul crept farther into the ring, relying on his own edge in speed.
    Jamis backed now that the realization swept over him--that this was no soft offworlder in the tahaddi ring, easy prey for a Fremen crysknife.
    Jessica saw the shadow of desperation in the man's face. Now is when he's most dangerous, she thought. Now he's desperate and can do anything. He sees that this is not like a child of his own people, but a fighting machine born and trained to it from infancy. Now the fear I planted in him has come to bloom.
    And she found in herself a sense of pity for Jamis--an emotion tempered by awareness of the immediate peril to her son.
    Jamis could do anything . . . any unpredictable thing, she told herself. She wondered then if Paul had glimpsed this future, if he were reliving this experience. But she saw the way her son moved, the beads of perspiration on his face and shoulders, the careful wariness visible in the flow of muscles. And for the first time she sensed, without understanding it, the uncertainty factor in Paul's gift.
    Paul pressed the fight now, circling but not attacking. He had seen the fear in his opponent. Memory of Duncan Idaho's voice flowed through Paul's awareness: "When your opponent fears you, then's the moment when you give the fear its own rein, give it the time to work on him. Let it become terror. The terrified man fights himself. Eventually, he attacks in desperation. That is the most dangerous moment, but the terrified man can be trusted usually to make a fatal mistake. You are being trained here to detect these mistakes and use them. " 
    The crowd in the cavern began to mutter.
    They think Paul's toying with Jamis, Jessica thought. They think Paul's being needlessly cruel.
    But she sensed also the undercurrent of crowd excitement, their enjoyment of the spectacle. And she could see the pressure building up in Jamis. The moment when it became too much for him to contain was as apparent to her as it was to Jamis . . . or to Paul.
    Jamis leaped high, feinting and striking down with his right hand, but the hand was empty. The crysknife had been shifted to his left hand.
    Jessica gasped.
    But Paul had been warned by Chani: "Jamis fights with either hand." And the depth of his training had taken in that trick en passant. "Keep the mind on the knife and not on the hand that holds it, " Gurney Halleck had told him time and again. "The knife is more dangerous than the hand and the knife can be in either hand." 
    And Paul had seen Jamis' mistake: bad footwork so that it took the man a heartbeat longer to recover from his leap, which had been intended to confuse Paul and hide the knife shift.
    Except for the low yellow light of the glowglobes and the inky eyes of the staring troop, it was similar to a session on the practice floor. Shields didn't count where the body's own movement could be used against it. Paul shifted his own knife in a blurred motion, slipped sideways and thrust upward where Jamis' chest was descending--then away to watch the man crumble.
    Jamis fell like a limp rag, face down, gasped once and turned his face toward Paul, then lay still on the rock floor. His dead eyes stared out like beads of dark glass.
    "Killing with the point lacks artistry," Idaho had once told Paul, "but don't let that hold your hand when the opening presents itself."
    The troop rushed forward, filling the ring, pushing Paul aside. They hid Jamis in a frenzy of huddling activity. Presently a group of them hurried back into the depths of the cavern carrying a burden wrapped in a robe.
    And there was no body on the rock floor.
    Jessica pressed through toward her son. She felt that she swam in a sea of robed and stinking backs, a throng strangely silent.
    Now is the terrible moment, she thought. He has killed a man in clear superiority of mind and muscle. He must not grow to enjoy such a victory.
    She forced herself through the last of the troop and into a small open space where two bearded Fremen were helping Paul into his stillsuit.
    Jessica stared at her son. Paul's eyes were bright. He breathed heavily, permitting the ministrations to his body rather than helping them.
    "Him against Jamis and not a mark on him," one of the men muttered.
    Chani stood at one side, her eyes focused on Paul. Jessica saw the girl's excitement, the admiration in the elfin face. 
    It must be done now and swiftly, Jessica thought.
    She compressed ultimate scorn into her voice and manner, said: "Well-l-l, now--how does it feel to be a killer?" 
    Paul stiffened as though he had been struck. He met his mother's cold glare and his face darkened with a rush of blood. Involuntarily he glanced toward the place on the cavern floor where Jamis had lain.
    Stilgar pressed through to Jessica's side, returning from the cave depths where the body of Jamis had been taken. He spoke to Paul in a bitter, controlled tone: "When the time comes for you to call me out and try for my burda, do not think you will play with me the way you played with Jamis."
    Jessica sensed the way her own words and Stilgar's sank into Paul, doing their harsh work on the boy. The mistake these people made--it served a purpose now. She searched the faces around them as Paul was doing, seeing what he saw. Admiration, yes, and fear . . . and in some--loathing. She looked at Stilgar, saw his fatalism, knew how the fight had seemed to him. 
    Paul looked at his mother. "You know what it was," he said.
    She heard the return to sanity, the remorse in his voice. Jessica swept her glance across the troop, said: "Paul has never before killed a man with a naked blade." 
    Stilgar faced her, disbelief in his face.
    "I wasn't playing with him," Paul said. He pressed in front of his mother, straightening his robe, glanced at the dark place of Jamis' blood on the cavern floor. "I did not want to kill him." 
    Jessica saw belief come slowly to Stilgar, saw the relief in him as he tugged at his beard with a deeply veined hand. She heard muttering awareness spread through the troop.
    "That's why y' asked him to yield," Stilgar said. "I see. Our ways are different, but you'll see the sense in them. I thought we'd admitted a scorpion into our midst." He hesitated, then: "And I shall not call you lad the more." 
    A voice from the troop called out: "Needs a naming, Stil." 
    Stilgar nodded, tugging at his beard. "I see strength in you . . . like the strength beneath a pillar." Again he paused, then: "You shall be known among us as Usul, the base of the pillar. This is your secret name, your troop name. We of Sietch Tabr may use it, but none other may so presume . . . Usul."
    Murmuring went through the troop: "Good choice, that . . . strong . . . bring us luck." And Jessica sensed the acceptance, knowing she was included in it with her champion. She was indeed Sayyadina. 
    "Now, what name of manhood do you choose for us to call you openly?" Stilgar asked.
    Paul glanced at his mother, back to Stilgar. Bits and pieces of this moment registered on his prescient memory, but he felt the differences as though they were physical, a pressure forcing him through the narrow door of the present.
    "How do you call among you the little mouse, the mouse that jumps?" Paul asked, remembering the pop-hop of motion at Tuono Basin. He illustrated with one hand. 
    A chuckle sounded through the troop.
    "We call that one Muad'Dib," Stilgar said.
    Jessica gasped. It was the name Paul had told her, saying that the Fremen would accept them and call him thus. She felt a sudden fear of her son and for him.
    Paul swallowed. He felt that he played a part already played over countless times in his mind . . . yet . . . there were differences. He could see himself perched on a dizzying summit, having experienced much and possessed of a profound store of knowledge, but all around him was abyss.
    And again he remembered the vision of fanatic legions following the green and black banner of the Atreides, pillaging and burning across the universe in the name of their prophet Muad'Dib. 
    That must not happen, he told himself.
    "Is that the name you wish, Muad'Dib?" Stilgar asked.
    "I am an Atreides," Paul whispered, and then louder: "It's not right that I give up entirely the name my father gave me. Could I be known among you as Paul-Muad'Dib?" 
    "You are Paul-Muad'Dib," Stilgar said.
    And Paul thought: That was in no vision of mine. I did a different thing.
    But he felt that the abyss remained all around him.
    Again a murmuring response went through the troop as man turned to man: "Wisdom with strength . . . Couldn't ask more . . . It's the legend for sure . . . Lisan al-Gaib . . . Lisan al-Gaib . . . " 
    "I will tell you a thing about your new name," Stilgar said. "The choice pleases us. Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul-Muad'Dib, who is Usul among us. We welcome you."
    Stilgar touched Paul's forehead with one palm, withdrew his hand, embraced Paul and murmured, "Usul."
    As Stilgar released him, another member of the troop embraced Paul, repeating his new troop name. And Paul was passed from embrace to embrace through the troop, hearing the voices, the shadings of tone; "Usul . . . Usul . . . Usul." Already, he could place some of them by name. And there was Chani who pressed her cheek against his as she held him and said his name.
    Presently Paul stood again before Stilgar, who said: "Now, you are of the Ichwan Bedwine, our brother." His face hardened, and he spoke with command in his voice. "And now, Paul-Muad'Dib, tighten up that stillsuit." He glanced at Chani. "Chani! Paul-Muad'Dib's nose plugs are as poor a fit I've ever seen! I thought I ordered you to see after him! "
    "I hadn't the makings, Stil," she said. "There's Jamis' of course, but--" 
    "Enough of that!"
    "Then I'll share one of mine," she said. "I can make do with one until--"
    "You will not," Stilgar said. "I know there are spares among us. Where are the spares? Are we a troop together or a band of savages?"
    Hands reached out from the troop offering hard, fibrous objects. Stilgar selected four, handed them to Chani. "Fit these to Usul and the Sayyadina."
    A voice lifted from the back of the troop: "What of the water, Stil? What of the literjons in their pack?"
    "I know your need, Farok," Stilgar said. He glanced at Jessica. She nodded.
    "Broach one for those that need it," Stilgar said. "Watermaster . . . where is a watermaster? Ah, Shimoom, care for the measuring of what is needed. The necessity and no more. This water is the dower property of the Sayyadina and will be repaid in the sietch at field rates less pack fees." 
    "What is the repayment at field rates?" Jessica asked. 
    "Ten for one," Stilgar said. 
    "But--" 
    "It's a wise rule as you'll come to see," Stilgar said.
    A rustling of robes marked movement at the back of the troop as men turned to get the water.
    Stilgar held up a hand, and there was silence. "As to Jamis," he said, "I order the full ceremony. Jamis was our companion and brother of the Ichwan Bedwine. There shall be no turning away without the respect due one who proved our fortune by his tahaddi-challenge. I invoke the rite . . . at sunset when the dark shall cover him."
    Paul, hearing these words, realized that he had plunged once more into the abyss . . . blind time. There was no past occupying the future in his mind . . . except . . . except . . . he could still sense the green and black Atreides banner waving . . . somewhere ahead . . . still see the jihad's bloody swords and fanatic legions.
    It will not be, he told himself. I cannot let it be.

    In the stillness of the cavern, Jessica heard the scrape of sand on rock as people moved, the distant bird calls that Stilgar had said were the signals of his watchmen.
    The great plastic hood-seals had been removed from the cave's opening. She could see the march of evening shadows across the lip of rock in front of her and the open basin beyond. She sensed the daylight leaving them, sensed it in the dry heat as well as the shadows. She knew her trained awareness soon would give her what these Fremen obviously had--the ability to sense even the slightest change in the air's moisture.
    How they had scurried to tighten their stillsuits when the cave was opened!
    Deep within the cave, someone began chanting:

"Ima trava okolo!
I korenja okolo!"

    Jessica translated silently: These are ashes! And these are roots! " 
    The funeral ceremony for Jamis was beginning.
    She looked out at the Arrakeen sunset, at the banked decks of color in the sky. Night was beginning to utter its shadows along the distant rocks and the dunes. 
    Yet the heat persisted.
    Heat forced her thoughts onto water and the observed fact that this whole people could be trained to be thirsty only at given times. 
    Thirst.
    She could remember moonlit waves on Caladan throwing white robes over rocks . . . and the wind heavy with dampness. Now the breeze that fingered her robes seared the patches of exposed skin at cheeks and forehead. The new nose plugs irritated her, and she found herself overly conscious of the tube that trailed down across her face into the suit, recovering her breath's moisture. 
    The suit itself was a sweatbox.
    "Your suit will be more comfortable when you've adjusted to a lower wafer content in your body, " Stilgar had said.
    She knew he was right, but the knowledge made this moment no more comfortable. The unconscious preoccupation with water here weighed on her mind. No, she corrected herself: it was preoccupation with moisture.
    And that was a more subtle and profound matter.
    She heard approaching footsteps, turned to see Paul come out of the cave's depths trailed by the elfin-faced Chani.
    There's another thing, Jessica thought. Paul must be cautioned about their women. One of these desert women would not do as wife to a Duke. As concubine, yes, but not as wife.
    Then she wondered at herself, thinking: Have I been infected with his schemes? And she saw how well she had been conditioned. I can think of the marital needs of royalty without once weighing my own concubinage. Yet . . . I was more than concubine. 
    "Mother." 
    Paul stopped in front of her. Chani stood at his elbow. 
    "Mother, do you know what they're doing back there?" 
    Jessica looked at the dark patch of his eyes staring out from the hood. "I think so."
    "Chani showed me . . . because I'm supposed to see it and give my . . . permission for the weighing of the water." 
    Jessica looked at Chani.
    "They're recovering Jamis' water," Chani said, and her thin voice came out nasal past the nose plugs. "It's the rule. The flesh belongs to the person, but his water belongs to the tribe . . . except in the combat." 
    "They say the water's mine," Paul said.
    Jessica wondered why this should make her suddenly alert and cautious.
    "Combat water belongs to the winner," Chani said. "It's because you have to fight in the open without stillsuits. The winner has to get his water back that he loses while fighting."
    "I don't want his water," Paul muttered. He felt that he was a part of many images moving simultaneously in a fragmenting way that was disconcerting to the inner eye. He could not be certain what he would do, but of one thing he was positive: he did not want the water distilled out of Jamis' flesh. 
    "It's . . . water," Chani said.
    Jessica marveled at the way she said it. "Water." So much meaning in a simple sound. A Bene Gesserit axiom came to Jessica's mind: "Survival is the ability to swim in strange water." And Jessica thought: Paul and I, we must find the currents and patterns in these strange waters . . . if we're to survive. 
    "You will accept the water," Jessica said.
    She recognized the tone in her voice. She had used that same tone once with Leto, telling her lost Duke that he would accept a large sum offered for his support in a questionable venture--because money maintained power for the Atreides. 
    On Arrakis, water was money. She saw that clearly.
    Paul remained silent, knowing then that he would do as she ordered--not because she ordered it, but because her tone of voice had forced him to re-evaluate. To refuse the water would be to break with accepted Fremen practice.
    Presently Paul recalled the words of 467 Kalima in Yueh's O.C. Bible. He said: "From water does all life begin." 
    Jessica stared at him. Where did he learn that quotation? she asked herself. He hasn't studied the mysteries.
    "Thus it is spoken," Chani said. "Giudichar mantene: It is written in the Shah-Nama that water was the first of all things created."
    For no reason she could explain (and this bothered her more than the sensation), Jessica suddenly shuddered. She turned away to hide her confusion and was just in time to see the sunset. A violent calamity of color spilled over the sky as the sun dipped beneath the horizon.
    "It is time!"
    The voice was Stilgar's ringing in the cavern. "Jamis' weapon has been killed. Jamis has been called by Him, by Shai-hulud, who has ordained the phases for the moons that daily wane and--in the end--appear as bent and withered twigs." Stilgar's voice lowered. "Thus it is with Jamis."
    Silence fell like a blanket on the cavern.
    Jessica saw the gray-shadow movement of Stilgar like a ghost figure within the dark inner reaches. She glanced back at the basin, sensing the coolness.
    "The friends of Jamis will approach," Stilgar said.
    Men moved behind Jessica, dropping a curtain across the opening. A single glowglobe was lighted overhead far back in the cave. Its yellow glow picked out an inflowing of human figures. Jessica heard the rustling of the robes.
    Chani took a step away as though pulled by the light.
    Jessica bent close to Paul's ear, speaking in the family code: "Follow their lead; do as they do. It will be a simple ceremony to placate the shade of Jamis."
    It will be more than that, Paul thought. And he felt a wrenching sensation within his awareness as though he were trying to grasp some thing in motion and render it motionless.
    Chani glided back to Jessica's side, took her hand. "Come, Sayyadina. We must sit apart."
    Paul watched them move off into the shadows, leaving him alone. He felt abandoned.
    The men who had fixed the curtain came up beside him. 
    "Come, Usul."
    He allowed himself to be guided forward, to be pushed into a circle of people being formed around Stilgar, who stood beneath the glowglobe and beside a bundled, curving, and angular shape gathered beneath a robe on the rock floor.
    The troop crouched down at a gesture from Stilgar, their robes hissing with the movement. Paul settled with them, watching Stilgar, noting the way the overhead globe made pits of his eyes and brightened the touch of green fabric at his neck. Paul shifted his attention to the robe-covered mound at Stilgar's feet, recognized the handle of a baliset protruding from the fabric.
    "The spirit leaves the body's water when the first moon rises," Stilgar intoned. "Thus it is spoken. When we see the first moon rise this night, whom will it summon?" 
    "Jamis," the troop responded.
    Stilgar turned full circle on one heel, passing his gaze across the ring of faces. "I was a friend of Jamis," he said. "When the hawk plane stooped upon us at Hole-in-the-Rock, it was Jamis pulled me to safety."
    He bent over the pile beside him, lifted away the robe. "I take this robe as a friend of Jamis--leader's right." He draped the robe over a shoulder, straightening.
    Now, Paul saw the contents of the mound exposed: the pale glistening gray of a stillsuit, a battered literjon, a kerchief with a small book in its center, the bladeless handle of a crysknife, an empty sheath, a folded pack, a paracompass, a distrans, a thumper, a pile of fist-sized metallic hooks, an assortment of what looked like small rocks within a fold of cloth, a clump of bundled feathers . . . and the baliset exposed beside the folded pack.
    So Jamis played the baliset, Paul thought. The instrument reminded him of Gurney Halleck and all that was lost. Paul knew with his memory of the future in the past that some chance-lines could produce a meeting with Halleck, but the reunions were few and shadowed. They puzzled him. The uncertainty factor touched him with wonder. Does it mean that something I will do . . . that I may do, could destroy Gurney . . . or bring him back to life . . . or . . . 
    Paul swallowed, shook his head. 
    Again, Stilgar bent over the mound.
    "For Jamis' woman and for the guards," he said. The small rocks and the book were taken into the folds of his robe. 
    "Leader's right," the troop intoned.
    "The marker for Jamis' coffee service," Stilgar said, and he lifted a flat disc of green metal. "That it shall be given to Usul in suitable ceremony when we return to the sietch." 
    "Leader's right," the troop intoned.
    Lastly, he took the crysknife handle and stood with it. 
    "For the funeral plain," he said.
    "For the funeral plain," the troop responded.
    At her place in the circle across from Paul, Jessica nodded, recognizing the ancient source of the rite, and she thought: The meeting between ignorance and knowledge, between brutality and culture--it begins in the dignity with which we treat our dead. She looked across at Paul, wondering: Will he see it? Will he know what to do?
    "We are friends of Jamis," Stilgar said. "We are not wailing for our dead like a pack of garvarg."
    A gray-bearded man to Paul's left stood up. "I was a friend of Jamis," he said. He crossed to the mound, lifted the distrans. "When our water went below minim at the siege at Two Birds, Jamis shared." The man returned to his place in the circle.
    Am I supposed to say I was a friend of Jamis? Paul wondered. Do they expect me to take something from that pile? He saw faces turn toward him, turn away. They do expect it!
    Another man across from Paul arose, went to the pack and removed the paracompass. "I was a friend of Jamis," he said. "When the patrol caught us at Bight-of-the-Cliff and I was wounded, Jamis drew them off so the wounded could be saved." He returned to his place in the circle.
    Again, the faces turned toward Paul, and he saw the expectancy in them, lowered his eyes. An elbow nudged him and a voice hissed: "Would you bring the destruction on us?" 
    How can I say I was his friend? Paul wondered.
    Another figure arose from the circle opposite Paul and, as the hooded face came into the light, he recognized his mother. She removed a kerchief from the mount. "I was a friend of Jamis," she said. "When the spirit of spirits within him saw the needs of truth, that spirit withdrew and spared my son." She returned to her place.
    And Paul recalled the scorn in his mother's voice as she had confronted him after the fight. "How does it f eel to be a killer?" 
    Again, he saw the faces turned toward him, felt the anger and fear in the troop. A passage his mother had once filmbooked for him on "The Cult of the Dead" flickered through Paul's mind. He knew what he had to do.
    Slowly, Paul got to his feet. 
    A sigh passed around the circle.
    Paul felt the diminishment of his self as he advanced into the center of the circle. It was as though he lost a fragment of himself and sought it here. He bent over the mound of belongings, lifted out the baliset. A string twanged softly as it struck against something in the pile.
    "I was a friend of Jamis," Paul whispered.
    He felt tears burning his eyes, forced more volume into his voice. "Jamis taught me . . . that . . . when you kill . . . you pay for it. I wish I'd known Jamis better."
    Blindly, he groped his way back to his place in the circle, sank to the rock floor.
    A voice hissed: "He sheds tears!"
    It was taken up around the ring: "Usul gives moisture to the dead!" 
    He felt fingers touch his damp cheek, heard the awed whispers.
    Jessica, hearing the voices, felt the depth of the experience, realized what terrible inhibitions there must be against shedding tears. She focused on the words: "He gives moisture to the dead." It was a gift to the shadow world--tears. They would be sacred beyond a doubt.
    Nothing on this planet had so forcefully hammered into her the ultimate value of water. Not the water-sellers, not the dried skins of the natives, not stillsuits or the rules of water discipline. Here there was a substance more precious than all others--it was life itself and entwined all around with symbolism and ritual.
    Water.
    "I touched his cheek," someone whispered. "I felt the gift." 
    At first, the fingers touching his face frightened Paul. He clutched the cold handle of the baliset, feeling the strings bite his palm. Then he saw the faces beyond the groping hands--the eyes wide and wondering.
    Presently, the hands withdrew. The funeral ceremony resumed. But now there was a subtle space around Paul, a drawing back as the troop honored him by a respectful isolation. The ceremony ended with a low chant:

"Full moon calls thee-- 
Shai-hulud shall thou see; 
Red the night, dusky sky, 
Bloody death didst thou die. 
We pray to a moon: she is round-- 
Luck with us will then abound, 
What we seek for shall be found 
In the land of solid ground."

    A bulging sack remained at Stilgar's feet. He crouched, placed his palms against it. Someone came up beside him, crouched at his elbow, and Paul recognized Chani's face in the hood shadow.
    "Jamis carried thirty-three liters and seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms of the tribe's water," Chani said. "I bless it now in the presence of a Sayyadina. Ekkeri-akairi, this is the water, fillissin-follasy of Paul-Muad'Dib! Kivi a-kavi, never the more, nakalas! Nakelas! to be measured and counted, ukair-an! by the heartbeats jan-jan-jan of our friend . . . Jamis."
    In an abrupt and profound silence, Chani turned, stared at Paul. Presently she said: "Where I am flame be thou the coals. Where I am dew be thou the water." 
    "Bi-lal kaifa," intoned the troop.
    "To Paul-Muad'Dib goes this portion," Chani said. "May he guard it for the tribe, preserving it against careless loss. May he be generous with it in time of need. May he pass it on in his time for the good of the tribe." 
    "Bi-lal kaifa," intoned the troop.
    I must accept that water, Paul thought. Slowly, he arose, made his way to Chani's side. Stilgar stepped back to make room for him, took the baliset gently from his hand. 
    "Kneel," Chani said. 
    Paul knelt.
    She guided his hands to the waterbag, held them against the resilient surface. "With this water the tribe entrusts thee," she said. "Jamis is gone from it. Take it in peace." She stood, pulling Paul up with her.
    Stilgar returned the baliset, extended a small pile of metal rings in one palm. Paul looked at them, seeing the different sizes, the way the light of the glowglobe reflected off them.
    Chani took the largest ring, held it on a finger. "Thirty liters," she said. One by one, she took the others, showing each to Paul, counting them. "Two liters; one liter; seven watercounters of one drachm each; one watercounter of three-thirty-seconds drachms. In all--thirty-three liters and seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms." 
    She held them up on her finger for Paul to see. 
    "Do you accept them?" Stilgar asked. 
    Paul swallowed, nodded. "Yes."
    "Later," Chani said, "I will show you how to tie them in a kerchief so they won't rattle and give you away when you need silence." She extended her hand.
    "Will you . . . hold them for me?" Paul asked. 
    Chani turned a startled glance on Stilgar.
    He smiled, said, "Paul-Muad'Dib who is Usul does not yet know our ways, Chani. Hold his watercounters without commitment until it's time to show him the manner of carrying them." 
    She nodded, whipped a ribbon of cloth from beneath her robe, linked the rings onto it with an intricate over and under weaving, hesitated, then stuffed them into the sash beneath her robe.
    I missed something there, Paul thought. He sensed the feeling of humor around him, something bantering in it, and his mind linked up a prescient memory: watercounters offered to a woman--courtship ritual.
    "Watermasters," Stilgar said.
    The troop arose in a hissing of robes. Two men stepped out, lifted the waterbag. Stilgar took down the glowglobe, led the way with it into the depths of the cave.
    Paul was pressed in behind Chani, noted the buttery glow of light over rock walls, the way the shadows danced, and he felt the troop's lift of spirits contained in a hushed air of expectancy.
    Jessica, pulled into the end of the troop by eager hands, hemmed around by jostling bodies, suppressed a moment of panic. She had recognized fragments of the ritual, identified the shards of Chakobsa and Bhotani-jib in the words, and she knew the wild violence that could explode out of these seemingly simple moments.
    Jan-jan-jan, she thought. Go-go-go.
    It was like a child's game that had lost all inhibition in adult hands.
    Stilgar stopped at a yellow rock wall. He pressed an outcropping and the wall swung silently away from him, opening along an irregular crack. He led the way through past a dark honeycomb lattice that directed a cool wash of air across Paul when he passed it.
    Paul turned a questioning stare on Chani, tugged her arm. "That air felt damp," he said. 
    "Sh-h-h-h," she whispered.
    But a man behind them said: "Plenty of moisture in the trap tonight. Jamis' way of telling us he's satisfied."
    Jessica passed through the secret door, heard it close behind. She saw how the Fremen slowed while passing the honeycomb lattice, felt the dampness of the air as she came opposite it.
    Windtrap! she thought. They've a concealed windtrap somewhere on the surface to funnel air down here into cooler regions and precipitate the moisture from it.
    They passed through another rock door with latticework above it, and the door closed behind them. The draft of air at their backs carried a sensation of moisture clearly perceptible to both Jessica and Paul.
    At the head of the troop, the glowglobe in Stilgar's hands dropped below the level of the heads in front of Paul. Presently he felt steps beneath his feet, curving down to the left. Light reflected back up across hooded heads and a winding movement of people spiraling down the steps.
    Jessica sensed mounting tension in the people around her, a pressure of silence that rasped her nerves with its urgency.
    The steps ended and the troop passed through another low door. The light of the glowglobe was swallowed in a great open space with a high curved ceiling.
    Paul felt Chani's hand on his arm, heard a faint dripping sound in the chill air, felt an utter stillness come over the Fremen in the cathedral presence of water.
    I have seen this place in a dream, he thought.
    The thought was both reassuring and frustrating. Somewhere ahead of him on this path, the fanatic hordes cut their gory path across the universe in his name. The green and black Atreides banner would become a symbol of terror. Wild legions would charge into battle screaming their war cry: "Muad'Dib!" 
    It must not be, he thought. I cannot let it happen. 
    But he could feel the demanding race consciousness within him, his own terrible purpose, and he knew that no small thing could deflect the juggernaut. It was gathering weight and momentum. If he died this instant, the thing would go on through his mother and his unborn sister. Nothing less than the deaths of all the troop gathered here and now--himself and his mother included--could stop the thing.
    Paul stared around him, saw the troop spread out in a line. They pressed him forward against a low barrier carved from native rock. Beyond the barrier in the glow of Stilgar's globe, Paul saw an unruffled dark surface of water. It stretched away into shadows--deep and black--the far wall only faintly visible, perhaps a hundred meters away.
    Jessica felt the dry pulling of skin on her cheeks and forehead relaxing in the presence of moisture. The water pool was deep; she could sense its deepness, and resisted a desire to dip her hands into it.
    A splashing sounded on her left. She looked down the shadowy line of Fremen, saw Stilgar with Paul standing beside him and the watermasters emptying their load into the pool through a flowmeter. The meter was a round gray eye above the pool's rim. She saw its glowing pointer move as the water flowed through it, saw the pointer stop at thirty-three liters, seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms.
    Superb accuracy in water measurement, Jessica thought. And she noted that the walls of the meter trough held no trace of moisture after the water's passage. The water flowed off those walls without binding tension. She saw a profound clue to Fremen technology in the simple fact: they were perfectionists.
    Jessica worked her way down the barrier to Stilgar's side. Way was made for her with casual courtesy. She noted the withdrawn look in Paul's eyes, but the mystery of this great pool of water dominated her thoughts.
    Stilgar looked at her. "There were those among us in need of water," he said, "yet they would come here and not touch this water. Do you know that?" 
    "I believe it," she said.
    He looked at the pool. "We have more than thirty-eight million decaliters here," he said. "Walled off from the little makers, hidden and preserved." 
    "A treasure trove," she said.
    Stilgar lifted the globe to look into her eyes. "It is greater than treasure. We have thousands of such caches. Only a few of us know them all." He cocked his head to one side. The globe cast a yellow-shadowed glow across face and beard. "Hear that?" 
    They listened.
    The dripping of water precipitated from the windtrap filled the room with its presence. Jessica saw that the entire troop was caught up in a rapture of listening. Only Paul seemed to stand remote from it.
    To Paul, the sound was like moments ticking away. He could feel time flowing through him, the instants never to be recaptured. He sensed a need for decision, but felt powerless to move.
    "It has been calculated with precision," Stilgar whispered. "We know to within a million decaliters how much we need. When we have it, we shall change the face of Arrakis."
    A hushed whisper of response lifted from the troop: "Bi-lal kaifa."
    "We will trap the dunes beneath grass plantings," Stilgar said, his voice growing stronger. "We will tie the water into the soil with trees and undergrowth." 
    "Bi-lal kaifa," intoned the troop.
    "Each year the polar ice retreats," Stilgar said.
    "Bi-lal kaifa," they chanted.
    "We shall make a homeworld of Arrakis--with melting lenses at the poles, with lakes in the temperate zones, and only the deep desert for the maker and his spice." 
    "Bi-lal kaifa."
    "And no man ever again shall want for water. It shall be his for dipping from well or pond or lake or canal. It shall run down through the qanats to feed our plants. It shall be there for any man to take. It shall be his for holding out his hand." 
    "Bi-lal kaifa."
    Jessica felt the religious ritual in the words, noted her own instinctively awed response. They're in league with the future, she thought. They have their mountain to climb. This is the scientist's dream . . . and these simple people, these peasants, are filled with it.
    Her thoughts turned to Liet-Kynes, the Emperor's planetary ecologist, the man who had gone native--and she wondered at him. This was a dream to capture men's souls, and she could sense the hand of the ecologist in it. This was a dream for which men would die willingly. It was another of the essential ingredients that she felt her son needed; people with a goal. Such people would be easy to imbue with fervor and fanaticism. They could be wielded like a sword to win back Paul's place for him.
    "We leave now," Stilgar said, "and wait for the first moon's rising. When Jamis is safely on his way, we will go home." 
    Whispering their reluctance, the troop fell in behind him, turned back along the water barrier and up the stairs.
    And Paul, walking behind Chani, felt that a vital moment had passed him, that he had missed an essential decision and was now caught up in his own myth. He knew he had seen this place before, experienced it in a fragment of prescient dream on faraway Caladan, but details of the place were being filled in now that he had not seen. He felt a new sense of wonder at the limits of his gift. It was as though he rode within the wave of time, sometimes in its trough, sometimes on a crest--and all around him the other waves lifted and fell, revealing and then hiding what they bore on their surface.
    Through it all, the wild jihad still loomed ahead of him, the violence and the slaughter. It was like a promontory above the surf.
    The troop filed through the last door into the main cavern. The door was sealed. Lights were extinguished, hoods removed from the cavern openings, revealing the night and the stars that had come over the desert.
    Jessica moved to the dry lip of the cavern's edge, looked up at the stars. They were sharp and near. She felt the stirring of the troop around her, heard the sound of a baliset being tuned somewhere behind her, and Paul's voice humming the pitch. There was a melancholy in his tone that she did not like.
    Chani's voice intruded from the deep cave darkness: "Tell me about the waters of your birthworld, Paul Muad'Dib." 
    And Paul: "Another time, Chani. I promise." 
    Such sadness.
    "It's a good baliset," Chani said.
    "Very good," Paul said. "Do you think Jamis'll mind my using it?"
    He speaks of the dead in the present tense, Jessica thought. The implications disturbed her.
    A man's voice intruded: "He liked music betimes, Jamis did." 
    "Then sing me one of your songs," Chani pleaded.
    Such feminine allure in that girl-child's voice, Jessica thought. I must caution Paul about their women . . . and soon.
    "This was a song of a friend of mine," Paul said. "I expect he's dead now, Gurney is. He called it his evensong." 
    The troop grew still, listening as Paul's voice lifted in a sweet boy tenor with the baliset tinkling and strumming beneath it:

"This clear time of seeing embers--
A gold-bright sun's lost in first dusk. 
What frenzied senses, desp'rate musk 
Are consort of rememb'ring."

    Jessica felt the verbal music in her breast--pagan and charged with sounds that made her suddenly and intensely aware of herself, feeling her own body and its needs. She listened with a tense stillness.

"Night's pearl-censered requi-em . . . 
"Tis for us!
What joys run, then--
Bright in your eyes--
What flower-spangled amores 
Pull at our hearts . . .
What flower-spangled amores 
Fill our desires."

    And Jessica heard the after-stillness that hummed in the air with the last note. Why does my son sing a love song to that girl-child? she asked herself. She felt an abrupt fear. She could sense life flowing around her and she had no grasp on its reins. Why did he choose that song? she wondered. The instincts are true sometimes. Why did he do this?
    Paul sat silently in the darkness, a single stark thought dominating his awareness: My mother is my enemy. She does not know it, but she is. She is bringing the jihad. She bore me; she trained me. She is my enemy.

-from "Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    On his seventeenth birthday, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen killed his one hundredth slave-gladiator in the family games. Visiting observers from the Imperial Court--a Count and Lady Fenring--were on the Harkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime for the event, invited to sit that afternoon with the immediate family in the golden box above the triangular arena.
    In honor of the na-Baron's nativity and to remind all Harkonnens and subjects that Feyd-Rautha was heir-designate, it was holiday on Giedi Prime. The old Baron had decreed a meridian-to-meridian rest from labors, and effort had been spent in the family city of Harko to create the illusion of gaiety: banners flew from buildings, new paint had been splashed on the walls along Court Way.
    But off the main way, Count Fenring and his lady noted the rubbish heaps, the scabrous brown walls reflected in the dark puddles of the streets, and the furtive scurrying of the people.
    In the Baron's blue-walled keep, there was fearful perfection, but the Count and his lady saw the price being paid--guards everywhere and weapons with that special sheen that told a trained eye they were in regular use. There were checkpoints for routine passage from area to area even within the keep. The servants revealed their military training in the way they walked, in the set of their shoulders . . . in the way their eyes watched and watched and watched.
    "The pressure's on," the Count hummed to his lady in their secret language. "The Baron is just beginning to see the price he really paid to rid himself of the Duke Leto."
    "Sometime I must recount for you the legend of the phoenix," she said.
    They were in the reception hall of the keep waiting to go to the family games. It was not a large hall--perhaps forty meters long and half that in width--but false pillars along the sides had been shaped with an abrupt taper, and the ceiling had a subtle arch, all giving the illusion of much greater space. 
    "Ah-h-h, here comes the Baron," the Count said.
    The Baron moved down the length of the hall with that peculiar waddling-glide imparted by the necessities of guiding suspensor-hung weight. His jowls bobbed up and down; the suspensors jiggled and shifted beneath his orange robe. Rings glittered on his hands and opafires shone where they had been woven into the robe.
    At the Baron's elbow walked Feyd-Rautha. His dark hair was dressed in close ringlets that seemed incongruously gay above sullen eyes. He wore a tight-fitting black tunic and snug trousers with a suggestion of bell at the bottom. Soft-soled slippers covered his small feet.
    Lady Fenring, noting the young man's poise and the sure flow of muscles beneath the tunic thought: Here's one who won't let himself go to fat.
    The Baron stopped in front of them, took Feyd-Rautha's arm in a possessive grip, said, "My nephew, the na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen." And, turning his baby-fat face toward Feyd-Rautha, he said, "The Count and Lady Fenring of whom I've spoken." 
    Feyd-Rautha dipped his head with the required courtesy. He stared at the Lady Fenring. She was golden-haired and willowy, her perfection of figure clothed in a flowing gown of ecru--simple fitness of form without ornament. Gray-green eyes stared back at him. She had that Bene Gesserit serene repose about her that the young man found subtly disturbing.
    "Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m-m," said the Count. He studied Feyd-Rautha. "The, hm-m-m-m, precise young man, ah, my . . . hm-m-m-m . . . dear?" The Count glanced at the Baron. "My dear Baron, you say you've spoken of us to this precise young man? What did you say?"
    "I told my nephew of the great esteem our Emperor holds for you. Count Fenring," the Baron said. And he thought: Mark him well, Feyd! A killer with the manners of a rabbit--this is the most dangerous kind.
    "Of course!" said the Count, and he smiled at his lady.
    Feyd-Rautha found the man's actions and words almost insulting. They stopped just short of something overt that would require notice. The young man focused his attention on the Count: a small man, weak-looking. The face was weaselish with overlarge dark eyes. There was gray at the temples. And his movements--he moved a hand or turned his head one way, then he spoke another way. It was difficult to follow.
    "Um-m-m-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m, you come upon such, mm-m-m, preciseness so rarely," the Count said, addressing the Baron's shoulder. "I . . . ah, congratulate you on the hm-m-m perfection of your ah-h-h heir. In the light of the hm-m-m elder, one might say."
    "You are too kind," the Baron said. He bowed, but Feyd-Rautha noted that his uncle's eyes did not agree with the courtesy.
    "When you're mm-m-m ironic, that ah-h-h suggests you're hm-m-m-m thinking deep thoughts," the Count said.
    There he goes again, Feyd-Rautha thought. It sounds like he's being insulting, but there's nothing you can call out for satisfaction.
    Listening to the man gave Feyd-Rautha the feeling his head was being pushed through mush . . . um-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m-m! Feyd-Rautha turned his attention back to the Lady Fenring. 
    "We're ah-h-h taking up too much of this young man's time," she said. "I understand he's to appear in the arena today." 
    By the houris of the Imperial hareem, she's a lovely one! Feyd-Rautha thought. He said: "I shall make a kill for you this day, my Lady. I shall make the dedication in the arena, with your permission."
    She returned his stare serenely, but her voice carried whiplash as she said: "You do not have my permission."
    "Feyd!" the Baron said. And he thought: That imp! Does he want this deadly Count to call him out?
    But the Count only smiled and said: "Hm-m-m-m-um-m-m." 
    "You really must be getting ready for the arena, Feyd," the Baron said. "You must be rested and not take any foolish risks." 
    Feyd-Rautha bowed, his face dark with resentment. "I'm sure everything will be as you wish, Uncle." He nodded to Count Fenring. "Sir." To the lady: "My Lady." And he turned, strode out of the hall, barely glancing at the knot of Families Minor near the double doors.
    "He's so young," the Baron sighed.
    "Um-m-m-m-ah indeed hmmm," the Count said.
    And the Lady Fenring thought: Can that be the young man the Reverend Mother meant? Is that a bloodline we must preserve?
    "We've more than an hour before going to the arena," the Baron sad. "Perhaps we could have our little talk now, Count Fenring." He tipped his gross head to the right. "There's a considerable amount of progress to be discussed."
    And the Baron thought; Let us see now how the Emperors errand boy gets across whatever message he carries without ever being so crass as to speak it right out.
    The Count spoke to his lady: "Um-m-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m, you mm-m will ah-h-h excuse us, my dear?"
    "Each day, some time each hour, brings change," she said. "Mm-m-m-m." And she smiled sweetly at the Baron before turning away. Her long skirts swished and she walked with a straight-backed regal stride toward the double doors at the end of the hall.
    The Baron noted how all conversation among the Houses Minor there stopped at her approach, how the eyes followed her. Bene Gesserit! the Baron thought. The universe would be better rid of them all!
    "There's a cone of silence between two of the pillars over here on our left," the Baron said. "We can talk there without fear of being overheard." He led the way with his waddling gait into the sound-deadening field, feeling the noises of the keep become dull and distant.
    The Count moved up beside the Baron, and they turned, facing the wall so their lips could not be read.
    "We're not satisfied with the way you ordered the Sardaukar off Arrakis," the Count said.
    Straight talk! the Baron thought.
    "The Sardaukar could not stay longer without risking that others would find out how the Emperor helped me," the Baron said.
    "But your nephew Rabban does not appear to be pressing strongly enough toward a solution of the Fremen problem." 
    "What does the Emperor wish?" the Baron asked. "There cannot be more than a handful of Fremen left on Arrakis. The southern desert is uninhabitable. The northern desert is swept regularly by our patrols." 
    "Who says the southern desert is uninhabitable?" 
    "Your own planetologist said it, my dear Count." 
    "But Doctor Kynes is dead." 
    "Ah, yes . . . unfortunate, that."
    "We've word from an overflight across the southern reaches," the Count said. "There's evidence of plant life." 
    "Has the Guild then agreed to a watch from space?" 
    "You know better than that, Baron. The Emperor cannot legally post a watch on Arrakis."
    "And I cannot afford it," the Baron said. "Who made this overflight?"
    "A . . . smuggler."
    "Someone has lied to you, Count," the Baron said. "Smugglers cannot navigate, the southern reaches any better than can Rabban's men. Storms, sand-static, and all that, you know. Navigation markers are knocked out faster than they can be installed." 
    "We'll discuss various types of static another time," the Count said.
    Ah-h-h-h, the Baron thought. "Have you found some mistake in my accounting then?" he demanded.
    "When you imagine mistakes there can be no self-defense," the Count said.
    He's deliberately trying to arouse my anger, the Baron thought. He took two deep breaths to calm himself. He could smell his own sweat, and the harness of the suspensors beneath his robe felt suddenly itchy and galling.
    "The Emperor cannot be unhappy about the death of the concubine and the boy," the Baron said. "They fled into the desert. There was a storm."
    "Yes, there were so many convenient accidents," the Count agreed
    "I do not like your tone, Count," the Baron said.
    "Anger is one thing, violence another," the Count said. "Let me caution you: Should an unfortunate accident occur to me here the Great Houses all would learn what you did on Arrakis. They've long suspected how you do business."
    "The only recent business I can recall," the Baron said, "was transportation of several legions of Sardaukar to Arrakis." 
    "You think you could hold that over the Emperor's head?" 
    "I wouldn't think of it!"
    The Count smiled. "Sardaukar commanders could be found who'd confess they acted without orders because they wanted a battle with your Fremen scum."
    "Many might doubt such a confession," the Baron said, but the threat staggered him. Are Sardaukar truly that disciplined? he wondered.
    "The Emperor does wish to audit your books," the Count said. 
    "Any time." 
    "You . . . ah . . . have no objections?"
    "None. My CHOAM Company directorship will bear the closest scrutiny." And he thought: Let him bring a false accusation against me and have it exposed. I shall stand there, Promethean, saying: "Behold me, I am wronged. " Then let him bring any other accusation against me, even a true one. The Great Houses will not believe a second attack from an accuser once proved wrong.
    "No doubt your books will bear the closest scrutiny," the Count muttered.
    "Why is the Emperor so interested in exterminating the Fremen?" the Baron asked.
    "You wish the subject to be changed, eh?" The Count shrugged. "It is the Sardaukar who wish it, not the Emperor. They needed practice in killing . . . and they hate to see a task left undone." 
    Does he think to frighten me by reminding me that he is supported by bloodthirsty killers? the Baron wondered.
    "A certain amount of killing has always been an arm of business," the Baron said, "but a line has to be drawn somewhere. Someone must be left to work the spice."
    The Count emitted a short, barking laugh. "You think you can harness the Fremen?"
    "There never were enough of them for that," the Baron said. "But the killing has made the rest of my population uneasy. It's reaching the point where I'm considering another solution to the Arrakeen problem, my dear Fenring. And I must confess the Emperor deserves credit for the inspiration."
    "Ah-h-h?"
    "You see, Count, I have the Emperor's prison planet, Salusa Secundus, to inspire me."
    The Count stared at him with glittering intensity. "What possible connection is there between Arrakis and Salusa Secundus?" 
    The Baron felt the alertness in Fenring's eyes, said: "No connection yet." 
    "Yet?"
    "You must admit it'd be a way to develop a substantial work force on Arrakis--use the place as a prison planet." 
    "You anticipate an increase in prisoners?"
    "There has been unrest," the Baron admitted. "I've had to squeeze rather severely, Fenring. After all, you know the price I paid that damnable Guild to transport our mutual force to Arrakis. That money has to come from somewhere."
    "I suggest you not use Arrakis as a prison planet without the Emperor's permission, Baron."
    "Of course not," the Baron said, and he wondered at the sudden chill in Fenring's voice.
    "Another matter," the Count said. "We learn that Duke Leto's Mentat, Thufir Hawat, is not dead but in your employ." 
    "I could not bring myself to waste him," the Baron said.
    "You lied to our Sardaukar commander when you said Hawat was dead."
    "Only a white lie, my dear Count. I hadn't the stomach for a long argument with the man." 
    "Was Hawat the real traitor?"
    "Oh, goodness, no! It was the false doctor." The Baron wiped at perspiration on his neck. "You must understand, Fenring, I was without a Mentat. You know that. I've never been without a Mentat. It was most unsettling." 
    "How could you get Hawat to shift allegiance?"
    "His Duke was dead." The Baron forced a smile. "There's nothing to fear from Hawat, my dear Count. The Mentat's flesh has been impregnated with a latent poison. We administer an antidote in his meals. Without the antidote, the poison is triggered--he'd die in a few days." 
    "Withdraw the antidote," the Count said. 
    "But he's useful!" 
    "And he knows too many things no living man should know." 
    "You said the Emperor doesn't fear exposure." 
    "Don't play games with me, Baron!" 
    "When I see such an order above the Imperial seal I'll obey it," the Baron said. "But I'll not submit to your whim." 
    "You think it whim?"
    "What else can it be? The Emperor has obligations to me, too, Fenring. I rid him of the troublesome Duke." 
    "With the help of a few Sardaukar."
    "Where else would the Emperor have found a House to provide the disguising uniforms to hide his hand in this matter?" 
    "He has asked himself the same question, Baron, but with a slightly different emphasis."
    The Baron studied Fenring, noting the stiffness of jaw muscles, the careful control. "Ah-h-h, now," the Baron said. "I hope the Emperor doesn't believe he can move against me in total secrecy." 
    "He hopes it won't become necessary."
    "The Emperor cannot believe I threaten him!" The Baron permitted anger and grief to edge his voice, thinking: Let him wrong me in that! I could place myself on the throne while still beating my breast over how I'd been wronged.
    The Count's voice went dry and remote as he said: "The Emperor believes what his senses tell him."
    "Dare the Emperor charge me with treason before a full Landsraad Council?" And the Baron held his breath with the hope of it. 
    "The Emperor need dare nothing."
    The Baron whirled away in his suspensors to hide his expression. It could happen in my lifetime! he thought. Emperor! Let him wrong me! Then--the bribes and coercion, the rallying of the Great Houses: they'd flock to my banner like peasants running for shelter. The thing they fear above all else is the Emperor's Sardaukar loosed upon them one House at a time.
    "It's the Emperor's sincere hope he'll never have to charge you with treason," the Count said.
    The Baron found it difficult to keep irony out of his voice and permit only the expression of hurt, but he managed. "I've been a most loyal subject. These words hurt me beyond my capacity to express." 
    "Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m," said the Count.
    The Baron kept his back to the Count, nodding. Presently he said, "It's time to go to the arena." 
    "Indeed," said the Count.
    They moved out of the cone of silence and, side by side, walked toward the clumps of Houses Minor at the end of the hall. A bell began a slow tolling somewhere in the keep--twenty-minute warning for the arena gathering.
    "The Houses Minor wait for you to lead them," the Count said, nodding toward the people they approached.
    Double meaning . . . double meaning, the Baron thought.
    He looked up at the new talismans flanking the exit to his hall--the mounted bull's head and the oil painting of the Old Duke Atreides, the late Duke Leto's father. They filled the Baron with an odd sense of foreboding, and he wondered what thoughts these talismans had inspired in the Duke Leto as they hung in the halls of Caladan and then on Arrakis--the bravura father and the head of the bull that had killed him.
    "Mankind has ah only one mm-m-m science," the Count said as they picked up their parade of followers and emerged from the hall into the waiting room--a narrow space with high windows and floor of patterned white and purple tile.
    "And what science is that?" the Baron asked.
    "It's the um-m-m-ah-h science of ah-h-h discontent," the Count said.
    The Houses Minor behind them, sheep-faced and responsive, laughed with just the right tone of appreciation, but the sound carried a note of discord as it collided with the sudden blast of motors that came to them when pages threw open the outer doors, revealing the line of ground cars, their guidon pennants whipping in a breeze.
    The Baron raised his voice to surmount the sudden noise, said, "I hope you'll not be discontented with the performance of my nephew today, Count Fenring."
    "I ah-h-h am filled um-m-m only with a hm-m-m sense of anticipation, yes," the Count said. "Always in the ah-h-h process verbal, one um-m-m ah-h-h must consider the ah-h-h office of origin."
    The Baron hid his sudden stiffening of surprise by stumbling on the first step down from the exit. Process verbal! That was a report of a crime against the Imperium!
    But the Count chuckled to make it seem a joke, and patted the Baron's arm.
    All the way to the arena, though, the Baron sat back among the armored cushions of his car, casting covert glances at the Count beside him, wondering why the Emperor's errand boy had thought it necessary to make that particular kind of joke in front of the Houses Minor. It was obvious that Fenring seldom did anything he felt to be unnecessary, or used two words where one would do, or held himself to a single meaning in a single phrase.
    They were seated in the golden box above the triangular arena--horns blaring, the tiers above and around them jammed with a hubbub of people and waving pennants--when the answer came to the Baron.
    "My dear Baron," the Count said, leaning close to his ear, "you know, don't you, that the Emperor has not given official sanction to your choice of heir?"
    The Baron felt himself to be within a sudden personal cone of silence produced by his own shock. He stared at Fenring, barely seeing the Count's lady come through the guards beyond to join the party in the golden box.
    "That's really why I'm here today," the Count said. "The Emperor wishes me to report on whether you've chosen a worthy successor. There's nothing like the arena to expose the true person from beneath the mask, eh?"
    "The Emperor promised me free choice of heir!" the Baron grated.
    "We shall see," Fenring said, and turned away to greet his lady. She sat down, smiling at the Baron, then giving her attention to the sand floor beneath them where Feyd-Rautha was emerging in giles and tights--the black glove and the long knife in his right hand, the white glove and the short knife in his left hand.
    "White for poison, black for purity," the Lady Fenring said. "A curious custom, isn't it, my love?" 
    "Um-m-m-m," the Count said.
    The greeting cheer lifted from the family galleries, and Feyd-Rautha paused to accept it, looking up and scanning the faces--seeing his cousines and cousins, the demibrothers, the concubines and out-freyn relations. They were so many pink trumpet mouths yammering amidst a flutter of colorful clothing and banners.
    It came to Feyd-Rautha then that the packed ranks of faces would look just as avidly at his blood as at that of the slave-gladiator. There was not a doubt of the outcome in this fight, of course. Here was only the form of danger without its substance--yet . . . 
    Feyd-Rautha held up his knives to the sun, saluted the three corners of the arena in the ancient manner. The short knife in white-gloved hand (white, the sign of poison) went first into its sheath. Then the long blade in the black-gloved hand--the pure blade that now was unpure, his secret weapon to turn this day into a purely personal victory: poison on the black blade.
    The adjustment of his body shield took only a moment, and he paused to sense the skin-tightening at his forehead assuring him he was properly guarded.
    This moment carried its own suspense, and Feyd-Rautha dragged it out with the sure hand of a showman, nodding to his handlers and distracters, checking their equipment with a measuring stare--gyves in place with their prickles sharp and glistening, the barbs and hooks waving with their blue streamers. 
    Feyd-Rautha signaled the musicians.
    The slow march began, sonorous with its ancient pomp, and Feyd-Rautha led his troupe across the arena for obeisance at the foot of his uncle's box. He caught the ceremonial key as it was thrown. 
    The music stopped.
    Into the abrupt silence, he stepped back two paces, raised the key and shouted. "I dedicate this truth to . . . " And he paused, knowing his uncle would think: The young fool's going to dedicate to Lady Fenring after all and cause a ruckus!
    " . . . to my uncle and patron, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen!" Feyd-Rautha shouted.
    And he was delighted to see his uncle sigh.
    The music resumed at the quick-march, and Feyd-Rautha led his men scampering back across the arena to the prudence door that admitted only those wearing the proper identification band. Feyd-Rautha prided himself that he never used the pru-door and seldom needed distracters. But it was good to know they were available this day--special plans sometimes involved special dangers. 
    Again, silence settled over the arena.
    Feyd-Rautha turned, faced the big red door across from him through which the gladiator would emerge. 
    The special gladiator.
    The plan Thufir Hawat had devised was admirably simple and direct, Feyd-Rautha thought. The slave would not be drugged--that was the danger. Instead, a key word had been drummed into the man's unconscious to immobilize his muscles at a critical instant. Feyd-Rautha rolled the vital word in his mind, mouthing it without sound: "Scum!" To the audience, it would appear that an un-drugged slave had been slipped into the arena to kill the na-Baron. And all the carefully arranged evidence would point to the slavemaster.
    A low humming arose from the red door's servomotors as they were armed for opening.
    Feyd-Rautha focused all his awareness on the door. This first moment was the critical one. The appearance of the gladiator as he emerged told the trained eye much it needed to know. All gladiators were supposed to be hyped on elacca drug to come out kill-ready in fighting stance--but you had to watch how they hefted the knife, which way they turned in defense, whether they were actually aware of the audience in the stands. The way a slave cocked his head could give the most vital clue to counter and feint. 
    The red door slammed open.
    Out charged a tall, muscular man with shaved head and darkly pitted eyes. His skin was carrot-colored as it should be from the elacca drug, but Feyd-Rautha knew the color was paint. The slave wore green leotards and the red belt of a semishield--the belt's arrow pointing left to indicate the slave's left side was shielded. He held his knife sword-fashion, cocked slightly outward in the stance of a trained fighter. Slowly, he advanced into the arena, turning his shielded side toward Feyd-Rautha and the group at the pru-door.
    "I like not the look of this one, "said one of Feyd-Rautha's barb-men. "Are you sure he's drugged, m'Lord?" 
    "He has the color," Feyd-Rautha said. 
    "Yet he stands like a fighter," said another helper.
    Feyd-Rautha advanced two steps onto the sand, studied this slave.
    "What has he done to his arm?" asked one of the distracters.
    Feyd-Rautha's attention went to a bloody scratch on the man's left forearm, followed the arm down to the hand as it pointed to a design drawn in blood on the left hip of the green leotards--a wet shape there: the formalized outline of a hawk. 
    Hawk!
    Feyd-Rautha looked up into the darkly pitted eyes, saw them glaring at him with uncommon alertness.
    It's one of Duke Leto's fighting men we took on Arrakis! Feyd-Rautha thought. No simple gladiator this! A chill ran through him, and he wondered if Hawat had another plan for this arena--a feint within a feint within a feint. And only the slavemaster prepared to take the blame!
    Feyd-Rautha's chief handler spoke at his ear: "I like not the look on that one, m'Lord. Let me set a barb or two in his knife arm to try him."
    "I'll set my own barbs," Feyd-Rautha said. He took a pair of the long, hooked shafts from the handler, hefted them, testing the balance. These barbs, too, were supposed to be drugged--but not this time, and the chief handler might die because of that. But it was all part of the plan.
    "You'll come out of this a hero," Hawat had said. "Killed your gladiator man to man and in spite of treachery. The slavemaster will be executed and your man will step into his spot." 
    Feyd-Rautha advanced another five paces into the arena, playing out the moment, studying the slave. Already, he knew, the experts in the stands above him were aware that something was wrong. The gladiator had the correct skin color for a drugged man, but he stood his ground and did not tremble. The aficionados would be whispering among themselves now: "See how he stands. He should be agitated--attacking or retreating. See how he conserves his strength, how he waits. He should not wait."
    Feyd-Rautha felt his own excitement kindle. Let there be treachery in Hawat's mind, he thought. I can handle this slave. And it's my long knife that carries the poison this time, not the short one. Even Hawat doesn't know that.
    "Hai, Harkonnen!" the slave called. "Are you prepared to die?"
    Deathly stillness gripped the arena. Slaves did not issue the challenge!
    Now, Feyd-Rautha had a clear view of the gladiator's eyes, saw the cold ferocity of despair in them. He marked the way the man stood, loose and ready, muscles prepared for victory. The slave grapevine had carried Hawat's message to this one: "You'll get a true chance to kill the na-Baron." That much of the scheme was as they'd planned it, then.
    A tight smile crossed Feyd-Rautha's mouth. He lifted the barbs, seeing success for his plans in the way the gladiator stood. 
    "Hai! Hai!" the slave challenged, and crept forward two steps. 
    No one in the galleries can mistake it now, Feyd-Rautha thought.
    This slave should have been partly crippled by drug-induced terror. Every movement should have betrayed his inner knowledge that there was no hope for him--he could not win. He should have been filled with the stories of the poisons the na-Baron chose for the blade in his white-gloved hand. The na-Baron never gave quick death; he delighted in demonstrating rare poisons, could stand in the arena pointing out interesting side effects on a writhing victim. There was fear in the slave, yes--but not terror.
    Feyd-Rautha lifted the barbs high, nodded in an almost-greeting. 
    The gladiator pounced.
    His feint and defensive counter were as good as any Feyd-Rautha had ever seen. A timed side blow missed by the barest fraction from severing the tendons of the na-Baron's left leg.
    Feyd-Rautha danced away, leaving a barbed shaft in the slave's right forearm, the hooks completely buried in flesh where the man could not withdraw them without ripping tendons. 
    A concerted gasp lifted from the galleries. 
    The sound filled Feyd-Rautha with elation.
    He knew now what his uncle was experiencing, sitting up there with the Fenrings, the observers from the Imperial Court, beside him. There could be no interference with this fight. The forms must be observed in front of witnesses. And the Baron would interpret the events in the arena only one way--threat to himself.
    The slave backed, holding knife in teeth and lashing the barbed shaft to his arm with the pennant. "I do not feel your needle!" he shouted. Again he crept forward, knife ready, left side presented, his body bent backward to give it the greatest surface of protection from the half-shield.
    That action, too, didn't escape the galleries. Sharp cries came from the family boxes. Feyd-Rautha's handlers were calling out to ask if he needed them.
    He waved them back to the pru-door.
    I'll give them a show such as they've never had before, Feyd-Rautha thought. No tame killing where they can sit back and admire the style. This'll be something to take them by the guts and twist them. When I'm Baron they'll remember this day and won't be a one of them can escape fear of me because of this day.
    Feyd-Rautha gave ground slowly before the gladiator's crablike advance. Arena sand grated underfoot. He heard the slave's panting, smelled his own sweat and a faint odor of blood on the air.
    Steadily, the na-Baron moved backward, turning to the right, his second barb ready. The slave danced sideways. Feyd-Rautha appeared to stumble, heard the scream from the galleries. 
    Again, the slave pounced.
    Gods, what a fighting man! Feyd-Rautha thought as he leaped aside. Only youth's quickness saved him, but he left the second barb buried in the deltoid muscle of the slave's right arm. 
    Shrill cheers rained from the galleries.
    They cheer me now, Feyd-Rautha thought. He heard the wildness in the voices just as Hawat had said he would. They'd never cheered a family fighter that way before. And he thought with an edge of grimness on a thing Hawat had told him: "It's easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire."
    Swiftly, Feyd-Rautha retreated to the center of the arena where all could see clearly. He drew his long blade, crouched and waited for the advancing slave.
    The man took only the time to lash the second barb tight to his arm, then sped in pursuit.
    Let the family see me do this thing, Feyd-Rautha thought. I am their enemy: let them think of me as they see me now. 
    He drew his short blade.
    "I do not fear you, Harkonnen swine," the gladiator said. "Your tortures cannot hurt a dead man. I can be dead on my own blade before a handler lays finger to my flesh. And I'll have you dead beside me!"
    Feyd-Rautha grinned, offered now the long blade, the one with the poison. "Try this one," he said, and feinted with the short blade in his other hand.
    The slave shifted knife hands, turned inside both parry and feint to grapple the na-Baron's short blade--the one in the white gloved hand that tradition said should carry the poison. 
    "You will die, Harkonnen," the gladiator gasped.
    They struggled sideways across the sand. Where Feyd-Rautha's shield met the slave's halfshield, a blue glow marked the contact. The air around them filled with ozone from the field. 
    "Die on your own poison!" the slave grated.
    He began forcing the white-gloved hand inward, turning the blade he thought carried the poison.
    Let them see this! Feyd-Rautha thought. He brought down the long blade, felt it clang uselessly against the barbed shaft lashed to the slave's arm.
    Feyd-Rautha felt a moment of desperation. He had not thought the barbed shafts would be an advantage for the slave. But they gave the man another shield. And the strength of this gladiator! The short blade was being forced inward inexorably, and Feyd-Rautha focused on the fact that a man could also die on an unpoisoned blade.
    "Scum!" Feyd-Rautha gasped.
    At the key word, the gladiator's muscles obeyed with a momentary slackness. It was enough for Feyd-Rautha. He opened a space between them sufficient for the long blade. Its poisoned tip flicked out, drew a red line down the slave's chest. There was instant agony in the poison. The man disengaged himself, staggered backward.
    Now, let my dear family watch, Feyd-Rautha thought. Let them think on this slave who tried to turn the knife he thought poisoned and use it against me. Let them wonder how a gladiator could come into this arena ready for such an attempt. And let them always be aware they cannot know for sure which of my hands carries the poison.
    Feyd-Rautha stood in silence, watching the slowed motions of the slave. The man moved within a hesitation-awareness. There was an orthographic thing on his face now for every watcher to recognize. The death was written there. The slave knew it had been done to him and he knew how it had been done. The wrong blade had carried the poison.
    "You!" the man moaned.
    Feyd-Rautha drew back to give death its space. The paralyzing drug in the poison had yet to take full effect, but the man's slowness told of its advance.
    The slave staggered forward as though drawn by a string--one dragging step at a time. Each step was the only step in his universe. He still clutched his knife, but its point wavered.
    "One day . . . one . . . of us . . . will . . . get . . . you," he gasped.
    A sad little moue contorted his mouth. He sat, sagged, then stiffened and rolled away from Feyd-Rautha, face down. 
    Feyd-Rautha advanced in the silent arena, put a toe under the gladiator and rolled him onto his back to give the galleries a clear view of the face when the poison began its twisting, wrenching work on the muscles. But the gladiator came over with his own knife, protruding from his breast.
    In spite of frustration, there was for Feyd-Rautha a measure of admiration for the effort this slave had managed in overcoming the paralysis to do this thing to himself. With the admiration came the realization that here was truly a thing to fear. 
    That which makes a man superhuman is terrifying.
    As he focused on this thought, Feyd-Rautha became conscious of the eruption of noise from the stands and galleries around him. They were cheering with utter abandon. 
    Feyd-Rautha turned, looking up at them.
    All were cheering except the Baron, who sat with hand to chin in deep contemplation--and the Count and his lady, both of whom were staring down at him, their faces masked by smiles.
    Count Fenring turned to his lady, said: "Ah-h-h-um-m-m, a resourceful um-m-m-m young man. Eh, mm-m-m-ah, my dear?" 
    "His ah-h-h synaptic responses are very swift," she said.
    The Baron looked at her, at the Count, returned his attention to the arena, thinking: If someone could get that close to one of mine! Rage began to replace his fear. I'll have the slavemaster dead over a slow fire this night . . . and if this Count and his lady had a hand in it . . . 
   The conversation in the Baron's box was remote movement to Feyd-Rautha, the voices drowned in the foot-stamping chant that came now from all around: 
    "Head! Head! Head! Head!"
    The Baron scowled, seeing the way Feyd-Rautha turned to him. Languidly, controlling his rage with difficulty, the Baron waved his hand toward the young man standing in the arena beside the sprawled body of the slave. Give the boy a head. He earned it by exposing the slavemaster.
    Feyd-Rautha saw the signal of agreement, thought: They think they honor me. Let them see what I think!
    He saw his handlers approaching with a saw-knife to do the honors, waved them back, repeated the gesture as they hesitated. They think they honor me with just a head! he thought. He bent and crossed the gladiator's hands around the protruding knife handle, then removed the knife and placed it in the limp hands.
    It was done in an instant, and he straightened, beckoned his handlers. "Bury this slave intact with his knife in his hands," he said. "The man earned it."
    In the golden box, Count Fenring leaned close to the Baron, said: "A grand gesture, that--true bravura. Your nephew has style as well as courage."
    "He insults the crowd by refusing the head," the Baron muttered.
    "Not at all," Lady Fenring said. She turned, looking up at the tiers around them.
    And the Baron noted the line of her neck--a truly lovely flowing of muscles--like a young boy's.
    "They like what your nephew did," she said.
    As the import of Feyd-Rautha's gesture penetrated to the most distant seats, as the people saw the handlers carrying off the dead gladiator intact, the Baron watched them and realized she had interpreted the reaction correctly. The people were going wild, beating on each other, screaming and stamping.
    The Baron spoke wearily. "I shall have to order a fete. You cannot send people home like this, their energies unspent. They must see that I share their elation." He gave a hand signal to his guard, and a servant above them dipped the Harkonnen orange pennant over the box--once, twice, three times--signal for a fete.
    Feyd-Rautha crossed the arena to stand beneath the golden box, his weapons sheathed, arms hanging at his sides. Above the undiminished frenzy of the crowd, he called: "A fete, Uncle?" 
    The noise began to subside as people saw the conversation and waited.
    "In your honor, Feyd!" the Baron called down. And again, he caused the pennant to be dipped in signal.
    Across the arena, the pru-barriers had been dropped and young men were leaping down into the arena, racing toward Feyd-Rautha.
    "You ordered the pru-shields dropped. Baron?" the Count asked.
    "No one will harm the lad," the Baron said. "He's a hero." 
    The first of the charging mass reached Feyd-Rautha, lifted him on their shoulders, began parading around the arena.
    "He could walk unarmed and unshielded through the poorest quarters of Harko tonight," the Baron said. "They'd give him the last of their food and drink just for his company." 
    The Baron pushed himself from his chair, settled his weight into his suspensors. "You will forgive me, please. There are matters that require my immediate attention. The guard will see you to the keep."
    The Count arose, bowed. "Certainly, Baron. We're looking forward to the fete. I've ah-h-h-mm-m-m never seen a Harkonnen fete."
    "Yes," the Baron said. "The fete." He turned, was enveloped by guards as he stepped into the private exit from the box.
    A guard captain bowed to Count Fenring. "Your orders, my Lord?"
    "We will ah-h-h wait for the worst mm-m-m crush to um-m-m pass," the Count said.
    "Yes, m'Lord." The man bowed himself back three paces.
    Count Fenring faced his lady, spoke again in their personal humming-code tongue: "You saw it, of course?" 
    In the same humming tongue, she said: "The lad knew the gladiator wouldn't be drugged. There was a moment of fear, yes, but no surprise." 
    "It was planned," he said. "The entire performance." 
    "Without a doubt." 
    "It stinks of Hawat." 
    "Indeed," she said.
    "I demanded earlier that the Baron eliminate Hawat." 
    "That was an error, my dear." 
    "I see that now." 
    "The Harkonnens may have a new Baron ere long." 
    "If that's Hawat's plan."
    "That will bear examination, true," she said.
    "The young one will be more amenable to control." 
    "For us . . . after tonight," she said.
    "You don't anticipate difficulty seducing him, my little brood-mother?" 
    "No, my love. You saw how he looked at me." 
    "Yes, and I can see now why we must have that bloodline." 
    "Indeed, and it's obvious we must have a hold on him. I'll plant deep in his deepest self the necessary prana-bindu phrases to bend him."
    "We'll leave as soon as possible--as soon as you're sure," he said.
    She shuddered. "By all means. I should not want to bear a child in this terrible place." 
    "The things we do in the name of humanity," he said. 
    "Yours is the easy part," she said.
    "There are some ancient prejudices I overcome," he said. "They're quite primordial, you know."
    "My poor dear," she said, and patted his cheek. "You know this is the only way to be sure of saving that bloodline." 
    He spoke in a dry voice: "I quite understand what we do." 
    "We won't fail," she said.
    "Guilt starts as a feeling of failure," he reminded.
    "There'll be no guilt," she said. "Hypno-ligation of that Feyd-Rautha's psyche and his child in my womb--then we go." 
    "That uncle," he said. "Have you ever seen such distortion?" 
    "He's pretty fierce," she said, "but the nephew could well grow to be worse."
    "Thanks to that uncle. You know, when you think what this lad could've been with some other upbringing--with the Atreides code to guide him, for example." 
    "It's sad, "she said.
    "Would that we could've saved both the Atreides youth and this one. From what I heard of that young Paul--a most admirable lad, good union of breeding and training." He shook his head. "But we shouldn't waste sorrow over the aristocracy of misfortune." 
    "There's a Bene Gesserit saying," she said. 
    "You have sayings for everything!" he protested.
    "You'll like this one," she said. "It goes: 'Do not count a human dead until you've seen his body. And even then you can make a mistake.' "

Muad'Dib tells us in "A Time of Reflection" that his first collisions with Arrakeen necessities were the true beginnings of his education. He learned then how to pole the sand for its weather, learned the language of the wind's needles stinging his skin, learned how the nose can buzz with sand-itch and how to gather his body's precious moisture around him to guard it and preserve it. As his eyes assumed the blue of the Ibad, he learned the Chakobsa way.
-Stilgar's preface to "Muad'Dib, the Man" by the Princess Irulan

    Stilgar's troop returning to the sietch with its two strays from the desert climbed out of the basin in the waning light of the first moon. The robed figures hurried with the smell of home in their nostrils. Dawn's gray line behind them was brightest at the notch in their horizon-calendar that marked the middle of autumn, the month of Caprock.
    Wind-raked dead leaves strewed the cliffbase where the sietch children had been gathering them, but the sounds of the troop's passage (except for occasional blunderings by Paul and his mother) could not be distinguished from the natural sounds of the night. 
    Paul wiped sweat-caked dust from his forehead, felt a tug at his arm, heard Chani's voice hissing. "Do as I told you: bring the fold of your hood down over your forehead! Leave only the eyes exposed. You waste moisture."
    A whispered command behind them demanded silence: "The desert hears you!" 
    A bird chirruped from the rocks high above them. 
    The troop stopped, and Paul sensed abrupt tension.
    There came a faint thumping from the rocks, a sound no louder than mice jumping in the sand. 
    Again, the bird chirruped.
    A stir passed through the troop's ranks. And again, the mouse-thumping pecked its way across the sand. 
    Once more, the bird chirruped.
    The troop resumed its climb up into a crack in the rocks, but there was a stillness of breath about the Fremen now that filled Paul with caution, and he noted covert glances toward Chani, the way she seemed to withdraw, pulling in upon herself.
    There was rock underfoot now, a faint gray swishing of robes around them, and Paul sensed a relaxing of discipline, but still that quiet-of-the-person about Chani and the others. He followed a shadow shape--up steps, a turn, more steps, into a tunnel, past two moisture-sealed doors and into a globelighted narrow passage with yellow rock walls and ceiling.
    All around him, Paul saw the Fremen throwing back their hoods, removing nose plugs, breathing deeply. Someone sighed. Paul looked for Chani, found that she had left his side. He was hemmed in by a press of robed bodies. Someone jostled him, said, "Excuse me, Usul. What a crush! It's always this way."
    On his left, the narrow bearded face of the one called Farok turned toward Paul. The stained eyepits and blue darkness of eyes appeared even darker under the yellow globes. "Throw off your hood, Usul," Farok said. "You're home." And he helped Paul, releasing the hood catch, elbowing a space around them.
    Paul slipped out his nose plugs, swung the mouth baffle aside. The odor of the place assailed him: unwashed bodies, distillate esters of reclaimed wastes, everywhere the sour effluvia of humanity with, over it all, a turbulence of spice and spicelike harmonics.
    "Why are we waiting, Farok?" Paul asked.
    "For the Reverend Mother, I think. You heard the message--poor Chani."
    Poor Chani? Paul asked himself. He looked around, wondering where she was, where his mother had got to in all this crush. 
    Farok took a deep breath. "The smells of home," he said.
    Paul saw that the man was enjoying the stink of this air, that there was no irony in his tone. He heard his mother cough then, and her voice came back to him through the press of the troop: "How rich the odors of your sietch, Stilgar. I see you do much working with the spice . . . you make paper . . . plastics . . . and isn't that chemical explosives?"
    "You know this from what you smell?" It was another man's voice.
    And Paul realized she was speaking for his benefit, that she wanted him to make a quick acceptance of this assault on his nostrils.
    There came a buzz of activity at the head of the troop and a prolonged indrawn breath that seemed to pass through the Fremen, and Paul heard hushed voices back down the line: "It's true then--Liet is dead."
    Liet, Paul thought. Then: Chani, daughter of Liet. The pieces fell together in his mind. Liet was the Fremen name of the planetologist.
    Paul looked at Farok, asked: "Is it the Liet known as Kynes?" 
    "There is only one Liet," Farok said.
    Paul turned, stared at the robed back of a Fremen in front of him. Then Liet-Kynes is dead, he thought.
    "It was Harkonnen treachery," someone hissed. "They made it seem an accident . . . lost in the desert . . . a 'thopter crash . . . " 
    Paul felt a burst of anger. The man who had befriended them, helped save them from the Harkonnen hunters, the man who had sent his Fremen cohorts searching for two strays in the desert . . . another victim of the Harkonnens.
    "Does Usul hunger yet for revenge?" Farok asked.
    Before Paul could answer, there came a low call and the troop swept forward into a wider chamber, carrying Paul with them. He found himself in an open space confronted by Stilgar and a strange woman wearing a flowing wraparound garment of brilliant orange and green. Her arms were bare to the shoulders, and he could see she wore no stillsuit. Her skin was a pale olive. Dark hair swept back from her high forehead, throwing emphasis on sharp cheekbones and aquiline nose between the dense darkness of her eyes.
    She turned toward him, and Paul saw golden rings threaded with water tallies dangling from her ears. 
    "This bested my Jamis?" she demanded.
    "Be silent, Harah," Stilgar said. "It was Jamis' doing--he invoked the tahaddi al-burhan."
    "He's not but a boy!" she said. She gave her head a sharp shake from side to side, setting the water tallies to jingling. "My children made fatherless by another child? Surely, 'twas an accident!" 
    "Usul, how many years have you?" Stilgar asked. 
    "Fifteen standard," Paul said.
    Stilgar swept his eyes over the troop. "Is there one among you cares to challenge me?" 
    Silence.
    Stilgar looked at the woman. "Until I've learned his weirding ways. I'd not challenge him." 
    She returned his stare. "But--"
    "You saw the stranger, woman who went with Chani to the Reverend Mother?" Stilgar asked. "She's an out-freyn Sayyadina, mother to this lad. The mother and son are masters of the weirding ways of battle."
    "Lisan al-Gaib," the woman whispered. Her eyes held awe as she turned them back toward Paul.
    The legend again, Paul thought.
    "Perhaps," Stilgar said. "It hasn't been tested, though." He returned his attention to Paul. "Usul, it's our way that you've now the responsibility for Jamis' woman here and for his two sons. His yali . . . his quarters, are yours. His coffee service is yours . . . and this, his woman."
    Paul studied the woman, wondering: Why isn't she mourning her man? Why does she show no hate for me? Abruptly, he saw that the Fremen were staring at him, waiting.
    Someone whispered: "There's work to do. Say how you accept her." 
    Stilgar said: "Do you accept Harah as woman or servant?" 
    Harah lifted her arms, turning slowly on one heel. "I am still young, Usul. It's said I still look as young as when I was with Geoff . . . before Jamis bested him." 
    Jamis killed another to win her, Paul thought.
    Paul said: "If I accept her as servant, may I yet change my mind at a later time?"
    "You'd have a year to change your decision," Stilgar said. "After that, she's a free woman to choose as she wishes . . . or you could free her to choose for herself at any time. But she's your responsibility, no matter what, for one year . . . and you'll always share some responsibility for the sons of Jamis." 
    "I accept her as servant," Paul said.
    Harah stamped a foot, shook her shoulders with anger. "But I'm young!"
    Stilgar looked at Paul, said: "Caution's a worthy trait in a man who'd lead." 
    "But I'm young!" Harah repeated.
    "Be silent," Stilgar commanded. "If a thing has merit, it'll be. Show Usul to his quarters and see he has fresh clothing and a place to rest." 
    "Oh-h-h-h!" she said.
    Paul had registered enough of her to have a first approximation. He felt the impatience of the troop, knew many things were being delayed here. He wondered if he dared ask the whereabouts of his mother and Chani, saw from Stilgar's nervous stance that it would be a mistake.
    He faced Harah, pitched his voice with tone and tremolo to accent her fear and awe, said: "Show me my quarters, Harah! We will discuss your youth another time."
    She backed away two steps, cast a frightened glance at Stilgar. "He has the weirding voice," she husked.
    "Stilgar," Paul said. "Chani's father put heavy obligation on me. If there's anything . . . "
    "It'll be decided in council," Stilgar said. "You can speak then." He nodded in dismissal, turned away with the rest of the troop following him.
    Paul took Harah's arm, noting how cool her flesh seemed, feeling her tremble. "I'll not harm you, Harah," he said. "Show me our quarters." And he smoothed his voice with relaxants.
    "You'll not cast me out when the year's gone?" she said. "I know for true I'm not as young as once I was."
    "As long as I live you'll have a place with me," he said. He released her arm. "Come now, where are our quarters?" 
    She turned, led the way down the passage, turning right into a wide cross tunnel lighted by evenly spaced yellow overhead globes. The stone floor was smooth, swept clean of sand.
    Paul moved up beside her, studied the aquiline profile as they walked. "You do not hate me, Harah?" 
    "Why should I hate you?"
    She nodded to a cluster of children who stared at them from the raised ledge of a side passage. Paul glimpsed adult shapes behind the children partly hidden by filmy hangings. 
    "I . . . bested Jamis."
    "Stilgar said the ceremony was held and you're a friend of Jamis." She glanced sidelong at him. "Stilgar said you gave moisture to the dead. Is that truth?" 
    "Yes." 
    "It's more than I'll do . . . can do." 
    "Don't you mourn him?" 
    "In the time of mourning, I'll mourn him."
    They passed an arched opening. Paul looked through it at men and women working with stand-mounted machinery in a large, bright chamber. There seemed an extra tempo of urgency to them. 
    "What're they doing in there?" Paul asked.
    She glanced back as they passed beyond the arch, said: "They hurry to finish the quota in the plastics shop before we flee. We need many dew collectors for the planting." 
    "Flee?" 
    "Until the butchers stop hunting us or are driven from our land." 
    Paul caught himself in a stumble, sensing an arrested instant of time, remembering a fragment, a visual projection of prescience--but it was displaced, like a montage in motion. The bits of his prescient memory were not quite as he remembered them. 
    "The Sardaukar hunt us," he said.
    "They'll not find much excepting an empty sietch or two," she said. "And they'll find their share of death in the sand." 
    "They'll find this place?" he asked. 
    "Likely." 
    "Yet we take the time to . . . " He motioned with his head toward the arch now far behind them. " . . . make . . . dew collectors?" 
    "The planting goes on." 
    "What're dew collectors?" he asked.
    The glance she turned on him was full of surprise. "Don't they teach you anything in the . . . wherever it is you come from?" 
    "Not about dew collectors."
    "Hai!" she said, and there was a whole conversation in the one word.
    "Well, what are they?"
    "Each bush, each weed you see out there in the erg," she said, "how do you suppose it lives when we leave it? Each is planted most tenderly in its own little pit. The pits are filled with smooth ovals of chromoplastic. Light turns them white. You can see them glistening in the dawn if you look down from a high place. White reflects. But when Old Father Sun departs, the chromoplastic reverts to transparency in the dark. It cools with extreme rapidity. The surface condenses moisture out of the air. That moisture trickles down to keep our plants alive."
    "Dew collectors," he muttered, enchanted by the simple beauty of such a scheme.
    "I'll mourn Jamis in the proper time for it," she said, as though her mind had not left his other question. "He was a good man, Jamis, but quick to anger. A good provider, Jamis, and a wonder with the children. He made no separation between Geoff's boy, my firstborn, and his own true son. They were equal in his eyes." She turned a questing stare on Paul. "Would it be that way with you, Usul?" 
    "We don't have that problem." 
    "But if--" 
    "Harah!" 
    She recoiled at the harsh edge in his voice.
    They passed another brightly lighted room visible through an arch on their left. "What's made there?" he asked.
    "They repair the weaving machinery," she said. "But it must be dismantled by tonight." She gestured at a tunnel branching to their left. "Through there and beyond, that's food processing and stillsuit maintenance." She looked at Paul. "Your suit looks new. But if it needs work, I'm good with suits. I work in the factory in season."
    They began coming on knots of people now and thicker clusterings of openings in the tunnel's sides. A file of men and women passed them carrying packs that gurgled heavily, the smell of spice strong about them.
    "They'll not get our water," Harah said. "Or our spice. You can be sure of that."
    Paul glanced at the openings in the tunnel walls, seeing the heavy carpets on the raised ledge, glimpses of rooms with bright fabrics on the walls, piled cushions. People in the openings fell silent at their approach, followed Paul with untamed stares.
    "The people find it strange you bested Jamis," Harah said. "Likely you'll have some proving to do when we're settled in a new sietch." 
    "I don't like killing," he said.
    "Thus Stilgar tells it," she said, but her voice betrayed her disbelief.
    A shrill chanting grew louder ahead of them. They came to another side opening wider than any of the others Paul had seen. He slowed his pace, staring in at a room crowded with children sitting cross-legged on a maroon-carpeted floor.
    At a chalkboard against the far wall stood a woman in a yellow wraparound, a projecto-stylus in one hand. The board was filled with designs--circles, wedges and curves, snake tracks and squares, flowing arcs split by parallel lines. The woman pointed to the designs one after the other as fast as she could move the stylus, and the children chanted in rhythm with her moving hand.
    Paul listened, hearing the voices grow dimmer behind as he moved deeper into the sietch with Harah.
    "Tree," the children chanted. "Tree, grass, dune, wind, mountain, hill, fire, lightning, rock, rocks, dust, sand, heat, shelter, heat, full, winter, cold, empty, erosion, summer, cavern, day, tension, moon, night, caprock, sandtide, slope, planting, binder . . . " 
    "You conduct classes at a time like this?" Paul asked.
    Her face went somber and grief edged her voice: "What Liet taught us, we cannot pause an instant in that. Liet who is dead must not be forgotten. It's the Chakobsa way."
    She crossed the tunnel to the left, stepped up onto a ledge, parted gauzy orange hangings and stood aside: "Your yali is ready for you, Usul."
    Paul hesitated before joining her on the ledge. He felt a sudden reluctance to be alone with this woman. It came to him that he was surrounded by a way of life that could only be understood by postulating an ecology of ideas and values. He felt that this Fremen world was fishing for him, trying to snare him in its ways. And he knew what lay in that snare--the wild jihad, the religious war he felt he should avoid at any cost.
    "This is your yali," Harah said. "Why do you hesitate?" 
    Paul nodded, joined her on the ledge. He lifted the hangings across from her, feeling metal fibers in the fabric, followed her into a short entrance way and then into a larger room, square, about six meters to a side--thick blue carpets on the floor, blue and green fabrics hiding the rock walls, glowglobes tuned to yellow overhead bobbing against draped yellow ceiling fabrics. 
    The effect was that of an ancient tent.
    Harah stood in front of him, left hand on hip, her eyes studying his face. "The children are with a friend," she said. "They will present themselves later."
    Paul masked his unease beneath a quick scanning of the room. Thin hangings to the right, he saw, partly concealed a larger room with cushions piled around the walls. He felt a soft breeze from an air duct, saw the outlet cunningly hidden in a pattern of hangings directly ahead of him.
    "Do you wish me to help you remove your stillsuit?" Harah asked.
    "No . . . thank you." 
    "Shall I bring food?" 
    "Yes."
    "There is a reclamation chamber off the other room." She gestured. "For your comfort and convenience when you're out of your stillsuit."
    "You said we have to leave this sietch," Paul said. "Shouldn't we be packing or something?"
    "It will be done in its time," she said. "The butchers have yet to penetrate to our region." 
    Still she hesitated, staring at him. 
    "What is it?" he demanded.
    "You've not the eyes of the Ibad," she said. "It's strange but not entirely unattractive." 
    "Get the food," he said. "I'm hungry."
    She smiled at him--a knowing, woman's smile that he found disquieting. "I am your servant," she said, and whirled away in one lithe motion, ducking behind a heavy wall hanging that revealed another passage before falling back into place.
    Feeling angry with himself, Paul brushed through the thin hanging on the right and into the larger room. He stood there a moment caught by uncertainty. And he wondered where Chani was . . . Chani who had just lost her father.
    We're alike in that, he thought.
    A wailing cry sounded from the outer corridors, its volume muffled by the intervening hangings. It was repeated, a bit more distant. And again. Paul realized someone was calling the time. He focused on the fact that he had seen no clocks.
    The faint smell of burning creosote bush came to his nostrils, riding on the omnipresent stink of the sietch. Paul saw that he had already suppressed the odorous assault on his senses.
    And he wondered again about his mother, how the moving montage of the future would incorporate her . . . and the daughter she bore. Mutable time-awareness danced around him. He shook his head sharply, focusing his attention on the evidences that spoke of profound depth and breadth in this Fremen culture that had swallowed them.
    With its subtle oddities.
    He had seen a thing about the caverns and this room, a thing that suggested far greater differences than anything he had yet encountered.
    There was no sign of a poison snooper here, no indication of their use anywhere in the cave warren. Yet he could smell poisons in the sietch stench--strong ones, common ones.
    He heard a rustle of hangings, thought it was Harah returning with food, and turned to watch her. Instead, from beneath a displaced pattern of hangings, he saw two young boys--perhaps aged nine and ten--staring out at him with greedy eyes. Each wore a small kindjal-type of crysknife, rested a hand on the hilt.
    And Paul recalled the stories of the Fremen--that their children fought as ferociously as the adults.

-description from "A Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    Phosphortubes in the faraway upper reaches of the cavern cast a dim light onto the thronged interior, hinting at the great size of this rock-enclosed space . . . larger, Jessica saw, than even the Gathering Hall of her Bene Gesserit school. She estimated there were more than five thousand people gathered out there beneath the ledge where she stood with Stilgar. 
    And more were coming.
    The air was murmurous with people.
    "Your son has been summoned from his rest, Sayyadina," Stilgar said. "Do you wish him to share in your decision?" 
    "Could he change my decision?"
    "Certainly, the air with which you speak comes from your own lungs, but--" 
    "The decision stands," she said.
    But she felt misgivings, wondering if she should use Paul as an excuse for backing out of a dangerous course. There was an unborn daughter to think of as well. What endangered the flesh of the mother endangered the flesh of the daughter.
    Men came with rolled carpets, grunting under the weight of them, stirring up dust as the loads were dropped onto the ledge.
    Stilgar took her arm, led her back into the acoustical horn that formed the rear limits of the ledge. He indicated a rock bench within the horn. "The Reverend Mother will sit here, but you may rest yourself until she comes." 
    "I prefer to stand," Jessica said.
    She watched the men unroll the carpets, covering the ledge, looked out at the crowd. There were at least ten thousand people on the rock floor now. 
    And still they came.
    Out on the desert, she knew, it already was red nightfall, but here in the cavern hall was perpetual twilight, a gray vastness thronged with people come to see her risk her life.
    A way was opened through the crowd to her right, and she saw Paul approaching flanked by two small boys. There was a swaggering air of self-importance about the children. They kept hands on knives, scowled at the wall of people on either side.
    "The sons of Jamis who are now the sons of Usul," Stilgar said. "They take their escort duties seriously." He ventured a smile at Jessica.
    Jessica recognized the effort to lighten her mood and was grateful for it, but could not take her mind from the danger that confronted her.
    I had no choice but to do this, she thought. We must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.
    Paul climbed to the ledge, leaving the children below. He stopped in front of his mother, glanced at Stilgar, back to Jessica. "What is happening? I thought I was being summoned to council." 
    Stilgar raised a hand for silence, gestured to his left where another way had been opened in the throng. Chani came down the lane opened there, her elfin face set in lines of grief. She had removed her stillsuit and wore a graceful blue wraparound that exposed her thin arms. Near the shoulder on her left arm, a green kerchief had been tied.
    Green for mourning, Paul thought.
    It was one of the customs the two sons of Jamis had explained to him by indirection, telling him they wore no green because they accepted him as guardian-father.
    "Are you the Lisan al-Gaib?" they had asked. And Paul had sensed the jihad in their words, shrugged off the question with one of his own--learning then that Kaleff, the elder of the two, was ten, and the natural son of Geoff. Orlop, the younger, was eight, the natural son of Jamis.
    It had been a strange day with these two standing guard over him because he asked it, keeping away the curious, allowing him the time to nurse his thoughts and prescient memories, to plan a way to prevent the jihad.
    Now, standing beside his mother on the cavern ledge and looking out at the throng, he wondered if any plan could prevent the wild outpouring of fanatic legions.
    Chani, nearing the ledge, was followed at a distance by four women carrying another woman in a litter.
    Jessica ignored Chani's approach, focusing all her attention on the woman in the litter--a crone, a wrinkled and shriveled ancient thing in a black gown with hood thrown back to reveal the tight knot of gray hair and the stringy neck.
    The litter-carriers deposited their burden gently on the ledge from below, and Chani helped the old woman to her feet. 
    So this is their Reverend Mother, Jessica thought.
    The old woman leaned heavily on Chani as she hobbled toward Jessica, looking like a collection of sticks draped in the black robe. She stopped in front of Jessica, peered upward for a long moment before speaking in a husky whisper.
    "So you're the one." The old head nodded once precariously on the thin neck. "The Shadout Mapes was right to pity you." 
    Jessica spoke quickly, scornfully: "I need no one's pity." 
    "That remains to be seen," husked the old woman. She turned with surprising quickness and faced the throng. "Tell them, Stilgar."
    "Must I?" he asked.
    "We are the people of Misr," the old woman rasped. "Since our Sunni ancestors fled from Nilotic al-Ourouba, we have known flight and death. The young go on that our people shall not die." 
    Stilgar took a deep breath, stepped forward two paces.
    Jessica felt the hush come over the crowded cavern--some twenty thousand people now, standing silently, almost without movement. It made her feel suddenly small and filled with caution.
    "Tonight we must leave this sietch that has sheltered us for so long and go south into the desert," Stilgar said. His voice boomed out across the uplifted faces, reverberating with the force given it by the acoustical horn behind the ledge. 
    Still the throng remained silent.
    "The Reverend Mother tells me she cannot survive another hajra," Stilgar said. "We have lived before without a Reverend Mother, but it is not good for people to seek a new home in such straits."
    Now, the throng stirred, rippling with whispers and currents of disquiet.
    "That this may not come to pass," Stilgar said, "our new Sayyadina Jessica of the Weirding, has consented to enter the rite at this time. She will attempt to pass within that we not lose the strength of our Reverend Mother."
    Jessica of the Weirding, Jessica thought. She saw Paul staring at her, his eyes filled with questions, but his mouth held silent by all the strangeness around them.
    If I die in the attempt, what will become of him? Jessica asked herself. Again she felt the misgivings fill her mind.
    Chani led the old Reverend Mother to a rock bench deep in the acoustical horn, returned to stand beside Stilgar.
    "That we may not lose all if Jessica of the Weirding should fail," Stilgar said, "Chani, daughter of Liet, will be consecrated in the Sayyadina at this time." He stepped one pace to the side.
    From deep in the acoustical horn, the old woman's voice came out to them, an amplified whisper, harsh and penetrating: "Chani has returned from her hajra--Chani has seen the waters." 
    A sussurant response arose from the crowd: "She has seen the waters."
    "I consecrate the daughter of Liet in the Sayyadina," husked the old woman.
    "She is accepted," the crowd responded.
    Paul barely heard the ceremony, his attention still centered on what had been said of his mother.
    If she should fail?
    He turned and looked back at the one they called Reverend Mother, studying the dried crone features, the fathomless blue fixation of her eyes. She looked as though a breeze would blow her away, yet there was that about her which suggested she might stand untouched in the path of a coriolis storm. She carried the same aura of power that he remembered from the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam who had tested him with agony in the way of the gom jabbar.
    "I, the Reverend Mother Ramallo, whose voice speaks as a multitude, say this to you," the old woman said. "It is fitting that Chani enter the Sayyadina." 
    "It is fitting," the crowd responded.
    The old woman nodded, whispered: "I give her the silver skies, the golden desert and its shining rocks, the green fields that will be. I give these to Sayyadina Chani. And lest she forget that she's servant of us all, to her fall the menial tasks in this Ceremony of the Seed. Let it be as Shai-hulud will have it." She lifted a brown-stick arm, dropped it.
    Jessica, feeling the ceremony close around her with a current that swept her beyond all turning back, glanced once at Paul's question filled face, then prepared herself for the ordeal.
    "Let the watermasters come forward," Chani said with only the slightest quaver of uncertainty in her girl-child voice.
    Now, Jessica felt herself at the focus of danger, knowing its presence in the watchfulness of the throng, in the silence.
    A band of men made its way through a serpentine path opened in the crowd, moving up from the back in pairs. Each pair carried a small skin sack, perhaps twice the size of a human head. The sacks sloshed heavily.
    The two leaders deposited their load at Chani's feet on the ledge and stepped back.
    Jessica looked at the sack, then at the men. They had their hoods thrown back, exposing long hair tied in a roll at the base of the neck. The black pits of their eyes stared back at her without wavering.
    A furry redolence of cinnamon arose from the sack, wafted across Jessica. The spice? she wondered. 
    "Is there water?" Chani asked.
    The watermaster on the left, a man with a purple scar line across the bridge of his nose, nodded once. "There is water, Sayyadina," he said, "but we cannot drink of it." 
    "Is there seed?" Chani asked. 
    "There is seed," the man said.
    Chani knelt and put her hands to the sloshing sack. "Blessed is the water and its seed." 
    There was familiarity to the rite, and Jessica looked back at the Reverend Mother Ramallo. The old woman's eyes were closed and she sat hunched over as though asleep. 
    "Sayyadina Jessica," Chani said.
    Jessica turned to see the girl staring up at her. 
    "Have you tasted the blessed water?" Chani asked.
    Before Jessica could answer, Chani said: "It is not possible that you have tasted the blessed water. You are outworlder and unprivileged."
    A sigh passed through the crowd, a sussuration of robes that made the nape hairs creep on Jessica's neck.
    "The crop was large and the maker has been destroyed," Chani said. She began unfastening a coiled spout fixed to the top of the sloshing sack.
    Now, Jessica felt the sense of danger boiling around her. She glanced at Paul, saw that he was caught up in the mystery of the ritual and had eyes only for Chani.
    Has he seen this moment in time? Jessica wondered. She rested a hand on her abdomen, thinking of the unborn daughter there, asking herself: Do I have the right to risk us both?
    Chani lifted the spout toward Jessica, said: "Here is the Water of Life, the water that is greater than water--Kan, the water that frees the soul. If you be a Reverend Mother, it opens the universe to you. Let Shai-hulud judge now."
    Jessica felt herself torn between duty to her unborn child and duty to Paul. For Paul, she knew, she should take that spout and drink of the sack's contents, but as she bent to the proffered spout, her senses told her its peril.
    The stuff in the sack had a bitter smell subtly akin to many poisons that she knew, but unlike them, too. 
    "You must drink it now," Chani said.
    There's no turning back, Jessica reminded herself. But nothing in all her Bene Gesserit training came into her mind to help her through this instant.
    What is it? Jessica asked, herself. Liquor? A drug?
    She bent over the spout, smelled the esters of cinnamon, remembering then the drunkenness of Duncan Idaho. Spice liquor? she asked herself. She took the siphon tube in her mouth, pulled up only the most minuscule sip. It tasted of the spice, a faint bite acrid on the tongue.
    Chani pressed down on the skin bag. A great gulp of the stuff surged into Jessica's mouth and before she could help herself, she swallowed it, fighting to retain her calmness and dignity.
    "To accept a little death is worse than death itself," Chani said. She stared at Jessica, waiting.
    And Jessica stared back, still holding the spout in her mouth. She tasted the sack's contents in her nostrils, in the roof of her mouth, in her cheeks, in her eyes--a biting sweetness, now. 
    Cool.
    Again, Chani sent the liquid gushing into Jessica's mouth. 
    Delicate.
    Jessica studied Chani's face--elfin features--seeing the traces of Liet-Kynes there as yet unfixed by time. 
    This is a drug they feed me, Jessica told herself.
    But it was unlike any other drug of her experience, and Bene Gesserit training included the taste of many drugs. 
    Chani's features were so clear, as though outlined in light. 
    A drug.
    Whirling silence settled around Jessica. Every fiber of her body accepted the fact that something profound had happened to it. She felt that she was a conscious mote, smaller than any subatomic particle, yet capable of motion and of sensing her surroundings. Like an abrupt revelation--the curtains whipped away--she realized she had become aware of a psychokinesthetic extension of herself. She was the mote, yet not the mote.
    The cavern remained around her--the people. She sensed them: Paul, Chani, Stilgar, the Reverend Mother Ramallo. 
    Reverend Mother!
    At the school there had been rumors that some did not survive the Reverend Mother ordeal, that the drug took them.
    Jessica focused her attention on the Reverend Mother Ramallo, aware now that all this was happening in a frozen instant of time--suspended time for her alone.
    Why is time suspended? she asked herself. She stared at the frozen expressions around her, seeing a dust mote above Chani's head, stopped there. 
    Waiting.
    The answer to this instant came like an explosion in her consciousness: her personal time was suspended to save her life.
    She focused on the psychokinesthetic extension of herself, looking within, and was confronted immediately with a cellular core, a pit of blackness from which she recoiled.
    That is the place where we cannot look, she thought. There is the place the Reverend Mothers are so reluctant to mention--the place where only a Kwisatz Haderach may look.
    This realization returned a small measure of confidence, and again she ventured to focus on the psychokinesthetic extension, becoming a mote-self that searched within her for danger. 
    She found it within the drug she had swallowed.
    The stuff was dancing particles within her, its motions so rapid that even frozen time could not stop them. Dancing particles. She began recognizing familiar structures, atomic linkages: a carbon atom here, helical wavering . . . a glucose molecule. An entire chain of molecules confronted her, and she recognized a protein . . . a methyl-protein configuration. 
    Ah-h-h!
    It was a soundless mental sigh within her as she saw the nature of the poison.
    With her psychokinesthetic probing, she moved into it, shifted an oxygen mote, allowed another carbon mote to link, reattached a linkage of oxygen . . . hydrogen.
    The change spread . . . faster and faster as the catalyzed reaction opened its surface of contact.
    The suspension of time relaxed its hold upon her, and she sensed motion. The tube spout from the sack was touched to her mouth--gently, collecting a drop of moisture.
    Chani's taking the catalyst from my body to change the poison in that sack, Jessica thought. Why?
    Someone eased her to a sitting position. She saw the old Reverend Mother Ramallo being brought to sit beside her on the carpeted ledge. A dry hand touched her neck.
    And there was another psychokinesthetic mote within her awareness! Jessica tried to reject it, but the mote swept closer . . . closer.
    They touched!
    It was like an ultimate simpatico, being two people at once: not telepathy, but mutual awareness. 
    With the old Reverend Mother!
    But Jessica saw that the Reverend Mother didn't think of herself as old. An image unfolded before the mutual mind's eye: a young girl with a dancing spirit and tender humor.
    Within the mutual awareness, the young girl said, "Yes, that is how I am." 
    Jessica could only accept the words, not respond to them. 
    "You'll have it all soon, Jessica," the inward image said. 
    This is hallucination, Jessica told herself.
    "You know better than that," the inward image said. "Swiftly now, do not fight me. There isn't much time. We . . . " There came a long pause, then; "You should've told us you were pregnant!"
    Jessica found the voice that talked within the mutual awareness. "Why?" 
    "This changes both of you! Holy Mother, what have we done?" 
    Jessica sensed a forced shift in the mutual awareness, saw another mote-presence with the inward eye. The other mote darted wildly here, there, circling. It radiated pure terror.
    "You'll have to be strong," the old Reverend Mother's image-presence said. "Be thankful it's a daughter you carry. This would've killed a male fetus. Now . . . carefully, gently . . . touch your daughter-presence. Be your daughter-presence. Absorb the fear . . . soothe . . . use your courage and your strength . . . gently now . . . gently . . . "
    The other whirling mote swept near, and Jessica compelled herself to touch it.
    Terror threatened to overwhelm her.
    She fought it the only way she knew: "I shall not fear. Fear is the mind killer . . . "
    The litany brought a semblance of calm. The other mote lay quiescent against her.
    Words won't work, Jessica told herself.
    She reduced herself to basic emotional reactions, radiated love, comfort, a warm snuggling of protection. 
    The terror receded.
    Again, the presence of the old Reverend Mother asserted itself, but now there was a tripling of mutual awareness--two active and one that lay quietly absorbing.
    "Time compels me," the Reverend Mother said within the awareness. "I have much to give you. And I do not know if your daughter can accept all this while remaining sane. But it must be: the needs of the tribe are paramount." 
    "What--" 
    "Remain silent and accept!"
    Experiences began to unroll before Jessica. It was like a lecture strip in a subliminal training projector at the Bene Gesserit school . . . but faster . . . blindingly faster. 
    Yet . . . distinct.
    She knew each experience as it happened: there was a lover--virile, bearded, with the Fremen eyes, and Jessica saw his strength and tenderness, all of him in one blink-moment, through the Reverend Mother's memory.
    There was no time now to think of what this might be doing to the daughter fetus, only time to accept and record. The experiences poured in on Jessica--birth, life, death--important matters and unimportant, an outpouring of single-view time.
    Why should a fall of sand from a clifftop stick in the memory? she asked herself.
    Too late, Jessica saw what was happening: the old woman was dying and, in dying, pouring her experiences into Jessica's awareness as water is poured into a cup. The other mote faded back into pre-birth awareness as Jessica watched it. And, dying-in-conception, the old Reverend Mother left her life in Jessica's memory with one last sighing blur of words.
    "I've been a long time waiting for you," she said. "Here is my life." 
    There it was, encapsuled, all of it. 
    Even the moment of death.
    I am now a Reverend Mother, Jessica realized.
    And she knew with a generalized awareness that she had become, in truth, precisely what was meant by a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. The poison drug had transformed her.
    This wasn't exactly how they did it at the Bene Gesserit school, she knew. No one had ever introduced her to the mysteries of it, but she knew.
    The end result was the same.
    Jessica sensed the daughter-mote still touching her inner awareness, probed it without response.
    A terrible sense of loneliness crept through Jessica in the realization of what had happened to her. She saw her own life as a pattern that had slowed and all life around her speeded up so that the dancing interplay became clearer.
    The sensation of mote-awareness faded slightly, its intensity easing as her body relaxed from the threat of the poison, but still she felt that other mote, touching it with a sense of guilt at what she had allowed to happen to it.
    I did it, my poor, unformed, dear little daughter, I brought you into this universe and exposed your awareness to all its varieties without any defenses.
    A tiny outflowing of love-comfort, like a reflection of what she had poured into it, came from the other mote.
    Before Jessica could respond, she felt the adab presence of demanding memory. There was something that needed doing. She groped for it, realizing she was being impeded by a muzziness of the changed drug permeating her senses.
    I could change that, she thought. I could take away the drug action and make it harmless. But she sensed this would be an error. I'm within a rite of joining.
    Then she knew what she had to do.
    Jessica opened her eyes, gestured to the watersack now being held above her by Chani.
    "It has been blessed," Jessica said. "Mingle the waters, let the change come to all, that the people may partake and share in the blessing."
    Let the catalyst do its work, she thought. Let the people drink of it and have their awareness of each other heightened for awhile. The drug is safe now . . . now that a Reverend Mother has changed it.
    Still, the demanding memory worked on her, thrusting. There was another thing she had to do, she realized, but the drug made it difficult to focus.
    Ah-h-h-h-h . . . the old Reverend Mother.
    "I have met the Reverend Mother Ramallo," Jessica said. "She is gone, but she remains. Let her memory be honored in the rite. 
    Now, where did I get those words? Jessica wondered.
    And she realized they came from another memory, the life that had been given to her and now was part of herself. Something about that gift felt incomplete, though.
    "Let them have their orgy," the other-memory said within her. "They've little enough pleasure out of living. Yes, and you and I need this little time to become acquainted before I recede and pour out through your memories. Already, I feel myself being tied to bits of you. Ah-h-h, you've a mind filled with interesting things. So many things I'd never imagined."
    And the memory-mind encapsulated within her opened itself to Jessica, permitting a view down a wide corridor to other Reverend Mothers until there seemed no end to them.
    Jessica recoiled, fearing she would become lost in an ocean of oneness. Still, the corridor remained, revealing to Jessica that the Fremen culture was far older than she had suspected.
    There had been Fremen on Poritrin, she saw, a people grown soft with an easy planet, fair game for Imperial raiders to harvest and plant human colonies on Bela Tegeuse and Salusa Secundus. 
    Oh, the wailing Jessica sensed in that parting.
    Far down the corridor, an image-voice screamed: "They denied us the Hajj!"
    Jessica saw the slave cribs on Bela Tegeuse down that inner corridor, saw the weeding out and the selecting that spread men to Rossak and Harmonthep. Scenes of brutal ferocity opened to her like the petals of a terrible flower. And she saw the thread of the past carried by Sayyadina after Sayyadina--first by word of mouth, hidden in the sand chanteys, then refined through their own Reverend Mothers with the discovery of the poison drug on Rossak . . . and now developed to subtle strengthen Arrakis in the discovery of the Water of Life.
    Far down the inner corridor, another voice screamed: "Never to forgive! Never to forget!"
    But Jessica's attention was focused on the revelation of the Water of Life, seeing its source: the liquid exhalation of a dying sandworm, a maker. And as she saw the killing of it in her new memory, she suppressed a gasp. 
    The creature was drowned! 
    "Mother, are you all right?"
    Paul's voice intruded on her, and Jessica struggled out of the inner awareness to stare up at him, conscious of duty to him, but resenting his presence.
    I'm like a person whose hands were kept numb, without sensation from the first moment of awareness--until one day the ability to feel is forced into them.
    The thought hung in her mind, an enclosing awareness.
    And I say: "Look! I have no hands!" But the people all around me say: "What are hands?" " 
    "Are you all right?" Paul repeated. 
    "Yes."
    "Is this all right for me to drink?" He gestured to the sack in Chani's hands. "They want me to drink it."
    She heard the hidden meaning in his words, realized he had detected the poison in the original, unchanged substance, that he was concerned for her. It occurred to Jessica then to wonder about the limits of Paul's prescience. His question revealed much to her.
    "You may drink it," she said. "It has been changed." And she looked beyond him to see Stilgar staring down at her, the dark-dark eyes studying.
    "Now, we know you cannot be false," he said.
    She sensed hidden meaning here, too, but the muzziness of the drug was overpowering her senses. How warm it was and soothing. How beneficent these Fremen to bring her into the fold of such companionship.
    Paul saw the drug take hold of his mother.
    He searched his memory--the fixed past, the flux-lines of the possible futures. It was like scanning through arrested instants of time, disconcerting to the lens of the inner eye. The fragments were difficult to understand when snatched out of the flux.
    This drug--he could assemble knowledge about it, understand what it was doing to his mother, but the knowledge lacked a natural rhythm, lacked a system of mutual reflection.
    He realized suddenly that it was one thing to see the past occupying the present, but the true test of prescience was to see the past in the future.
    Things persisted in not being what they seemed.
    "Drink it," Chani said. She waved the hornspout of a watersack under his nose.
    Paul straightened, staring at Chani. He felt carnival excitement in the air. He knew what would happen if he drank this spice drug with its quintessence of the substance that brought the change onto him. He would return to the vision of pure time, of time-become-space. It would perch him on the dizzying summit and defy him to understand.
    From behind Chani, Stilgar said: "Drink it, lad. You delay the rite."
    Paul listened to the crowd then, hearing the wildness in their voices--"Lisan al-Gaib," they said. "Muad'Dib!" He looked down at his mother. She appeared peacefully asleep in a sitting position--her breathing even and deep. A phrase out of the future that was his lonely past came into his mind: "She sleeps in the Waters of Life." 
    Chani tugged at his sleeve.
    Paul took the hornspout into his mouth, hearing the people shout. He felt the liquid gush into his throat as Chani pressed the sack, sensed giddiness in the fumes. Chani removed the spout, handed the sack into hands that reached for it from the floor of the cavern. His eyes focused on her arm, the green band of mourning there.
    As she straightened, Chani saw the direction of his gaze, said: "I can mourn him even in the happiness of the waters. This was something he gave us." She put her hand into his, pulling him along the ledge. "We are alike in a thing, Usul: We have each lost a father to the Harkonnens."
    Paul followed her. He felt that his head had been separated from his body and restored with odd connections. His legs were remote and rubbery.
    They entered a narrow side passage, its walls dimly lighted by spaced-out glowglobes. Paul felt the drug beginning to have its unique effect on him, opening time like a flower. He found need to steady himself against Chani as they turned through another shadowed tunnel. The mixture of whipcord and softness he felt beneath her robe stirred his blood. The sensation mingled with the work of the drug, folding future and past into the present, leaving him the thinnest margin of trinocular focus.
    "I know you, Chani," he whispered. "We've sat upon a ledge above the sand while I soothed your fears. We've caressed in the dark of the sietch. We've . . . " He found himself losing focus, tried to shake his head, stumbled.
    Chani steadied him, led him through thick hangings into the yellow warmth of a private apartment--tow tables, cushions, a sleeping pad beneath an orange spread.
    Paul grew aware that they had stopped, that Chani stood facing him, and that her eyes betrayed a look of quiet terror. 
    "You must tell me," she whispered. 
    "You are Sihaya," he said, "the desert spring." 
    "When the tribe shares the Water," she said, "we're together--all of us. We . . . share. I can . . . sense the others with me, but I'm afraid to share with you." 
    "Why?"
    He tried to focus on her, but past and future were merging into the present, blurring her image. He saw her in countless ways and positions and settings.
    "There's something frightening in you," she said. "When I took you away from the others . . . I did it because I could feel what the others wanted. You . . . press on people. You . . . make us see things!" 
    He forced himself to speak distinctly: "What do you see?" 
    She looked down at her hands. "I see a child . . . in my arms. It's our child, yours and mine." She put a hand to her mouth. "How can I know every feature of you?"
    They've a little of the talent, his mind told him. But they suppress it because it terrifies.
    In a moment of clarity, he saw how Chani was trembling. 
    "What is it you want to say?" he asked. 
    "Usul," she whispered, and still she trembled. 
    "You cannot back into the future," he said.
    A profound compassion for her swept through him. He pulled her against him, stroked her head. "Chani, Chani, don't fear." 
    "Usul, help me," she cried.
    As she spoke, he felt the drug complete its work within him, ripping away the curtains to let him see the distant gray turmoil of his future.
    "You're so quiet," Chani said.
    He held himself poised in the awareness, seeing time stretch out in its weird dimension, delicately balanced yet whirling, narrow yet spread like a net gathering countless worlds and forces, a tightwire that he must walk, yet a teeter-totter on which he balanced.
    On one side he could see the Imperium, a Harkonnen called Feyd-Rautha who flashed toward him like a deadly blade, the Sardaukar raging off their planet to spread pogrom on Arrakis, the Guild conniving and plotting, the Bene Gesserit with their scheme of selective breeding. They lay massed like a thunderhead on his horizon, held back by no more than the Fremen and their Muad'Dib, the sleeping giant Fremen poised for their wild crusade across the universe.
    Paul felt himself at the center, at the pivot where the whole structure turned, walking a thin wire of peace with a measure of happiness, Chani at his side. He could see it stretching ahead of him, a time of relative quiet in a hidden sietch, a moment of peace between periods of violence.
    "There's no other place for peace," he said.
    "Usul, you're crying," Chani murmured. "Usul, my strength, do you give moisture to the dead? To whose dead?" 
    "To ones not yet dead," he said.
    "Then let them have their time of life," she said.
    He sensed through the drug fog how right she was, pulled her against him with savage pressure. "Sihaya!" he said.
    She put a palm against his cheek, "I'm no longer afraid, Usul. Look at me. I see what you see when you hold me thus." 
    "What do you see?" he demanded.
    "I see us giving love to each other in a time of quiet between storms. It's what we were meant to do."
    The drug had him again and he thought: So many times you've given me comfort and forgetfulness. He felt anew the hyperillumination with its high-relief imagery of time, sensed his future becoming memories--the tender indignities of physical love, the sharing and communion of selves, the softness and the violence. 
    "You're the strong one, Chani," he muttered. "Stay with me. " 
    "Always," she said, and kissed his cheek.

Book Three
THE PROPHET

= = = = = =

No woman, no man, no child ever was deeply intimate with my father. The closest anyone ever came to casual camaraderie with the Padishah Emperor was the relationship offered by Count Hasimir Fenring, a companion from childhood. The measure of Count Fenring's friendship may be seen first in a positive thing: he allayed the Landsraad's suspicions after the Arrakis Affair. It cost more than a billion solaris in spice bribes, so my mother said, and there were other gifts as well: slave women, royal honors, and tokens of rank. The second major evidence of the Count's friendship was negative. He refused to kill a man even though it was within his capabilities and my father commanded it. I will relate this presently.
-"Count Fenring: A Profile" by the Princess Irulan

    The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen raged down the corridor from his private apartments, flitting through patches of late afternoon sunlight that poured down from high windows. He bobbed and twisted in his suspensors with violent movements.
    Past the private kitchen he stormed -- past the library, past the small reception room and into the servants' antechamber where the evening relaxation already had set in.
    The guard captain, Iakin Nefud, squatted on a divan across the chamber, the stupor of semuta dullness in his flat face, the eerie wailing of semuta music around him. His own court sat near to do his bidding.
    "Nefud!" the Baron roared. 
    Men scrambled.
    Nefud stood, his face composed by the narcotic but with an overlay of paleness that told of his fear. The semuta music had stopped.
    "My Lord Baron," Nefud said. Only the drug kept the trembling out of his voice.
    The Baron scanned the faces around him, seeing the looks of frantic quiet in them. He returned his attention to Nefud, and spoke in a silken tone:
    "How long have you been my guard captain, Nefud?" 
    Nefud swallowed. "Since Arrakis, my Lord. Almost two years."
    "And have you always anticipated dangers to my person?" 
    "Such has been my only desire, my Lord." 
    "Then where is Feyd-Rautha?" the Baron roared. 
    Nefud recoiled. "M'Lord?"
    "You do not consider Feyd-Rautha a danger to my person?" Again, the voice was silken.
    Nefud wet his lips with his tongue. Some of the semuta dullness left his eyes. "Feyd-Rautha's in the slave quarters, my Lord." 
    "With the women again, eh?" The Baron trembled with the effort of suppressing anger. 
    "Sire, it could be he's --" 
    "Silence!"
    The Baron advanced another step into the antechamber, noting how the men moved back, clearing a subtle space around Nefud, dissociating themselves from the object of wrath.
    "Did I not command you to know precisely where the na-Baron was at all times?" the Baron asked. He moved a step closer. "Did I not say to you that you were to know precisely what the na-Baron was saying at all times -- and to whom?" Another step. "Did I not say to you that you were to tell me whenever he went into the quarters of the slave women?" 
    Nefud swallowed. Perspiration stood out on his forehead.
    The Baron held his voice flat, almost devoid of emphasis: "Did I not say these things to you?" 
    Nefud nodded.
    "And did I not say to that you were to check all slave boys sent to me and that you were to do this yourself . . . personally?" 
    Again, Nefud nodded.
    "Did you, perchance, not see the blemish on the thigh of the one sent me this evening?" the Baron asked. "Is it possible you --" 
    "Uncle."
    The Baron whirled, stared at Feyd-Rautha standing in the doorway. The presence of his nephew here, now -- the look of hurry that the young man could not quite conceal -- all revealed much. Feyd-Rautha had his own spy system focused on the Baron.
    "There is a body in my chambers that I wish removed," the Baron said, and he kept his hand at the projectile weapon beneath his robes, thankful that his shield was the best.
    Feyd-Rautha glanced at two guardsmen against the right wall, nodded. The two detached themselves, scurried out the door and down the hall toward the Baron's apartments.
    Those two, eh? the Baron thought. Ah, this young monster has much to learn yet about conspiracy!
    "I presume you left matters peaceful in the slave quarters, Feyd," the Baron said.
    "I've been playing cheops with the slavemaster," Feyd-Rautha said, and he thought: What has gone wrong? The boy we sent to my uncle has obviously been killed. But he was perfect for the job. Even Hawat couldn't have made a better choice. The boy was perfect!
    "Playing pyramid chess," the Baron said. "How nice. Did you win?"
    "I . . . ah, yes, Uncle." And Feyd-Rautha strove to contain his disquiet.
    The Baron snapped his fingers. "Nefud, you wish to be restored to my good graces?" 
    "Sire, what have I done?" Nefud quavered.
    "That's unimportant now," the Baron said. "Feyd has beaten the slavemaster at cheops. Did you hear that?" 
    "Yes . . . Sire."
    "I wish you to take three men and go to the slavemaster," the Baron said. "Garrote the slavemaster. Bring his body to me when you've finished that I may see it was done properly. We cannot have such inept chess players in our employ." 
    Feyd-Rautha went pale, took a step forward. "But, Uncle, I --" 
    "Later, Feyd," the Baron said, and waved a hand. "Later." 
    The two guards who had gone to the Baron's quarters for the slave boy's body staggered past the antechamber door with their load sagging between them, arms trailing. The Baron watched until they were out of sight.
    Nefud stepped up beside the Baron. "You wish me to kill the slavemaster, now, my Lord?"
    "Now," the Baron said. "And when you've finished, add those two who just passed to your list. I don't like the way they carried that body. One should do such things neatly. I'll wish to see their carcasses, too." 
    Nefud said, "My Lord, is it anything that I've --" 
    "Do as your master has ordered," Feyd-Rautha said. And he thought: All I can hope for now is to save my own skin.
    Good! the Baron thought. He yet knows how to cut his losses. And the Baron smiled inwardly at himself, thinking: The lad knows, too, what will please me and be most apt to stay my wrath from falling on him. He knows I must preserve him. Who else do I have who could take the reins I must leave someday? I have no other as capable. But he must learn! And I must preserve myself while he's learning.
    Nefud signaled men to assist him, led them out the door.
    "Would you accompany me to my chambers, Feyd?" the Baron asked.
    "I am yours to command," Feyd-Rautha said. He bowed, thinking: I'm caught.
    "After you," the Baron said, and he gestured to the door.
    Feyd-Rautha indicated his fear by only the barest hesitation. Have I failed utterly? he asked himself. Will he slip a poisoned blade into my back . . . slowly, through the shield? Does he have an alternative successor?
    Let him experience this moment of terror, the Baron thought as he walked along behind his nephew. He will succeed me, but at a time of my choosing. I'll not have him throwing away what I've built!
    Feyd-Rautha tried not to walk too swiftly. He felt the skin crawling on his back as though his body itself wondered when the blow could come. His muscles alternately tensed and relaxed.
    "Have you heard the latest word from Arrakis?" the Baron asked.
    "No, Uncle."
    Feyd-Rautha forced himself not to look back. He turned down the hall out of the servants' wing.
    "They've a new prophet or religious leader of some kind among the Fremen," the Baron said. "They call him Muad'Dib. Very funny, really. It means 'the Mouse.' I've told Rabban to let them have their religion. It'll keep them occupied."
    "That's very interesting, Uncle," Feyd-Rautha said. He turned into the private corridor to his uncle's quarters, wondering: Why does he talk about religion? Is it some subtle hint to me? 
    "Yes, isn't it?" the Baron said.
    They came into the Baron's apartments through the reception salon to the bedchamber. Subtle signs of a struggle greeted them here -- a suspensor lamp displaced, a bedcushion on the floor, a soother-reel spilled open across a bedstand.
    "It was a clever plan," the Baron said. He kept his body shield tuned to maximum, stopped, facing his nephew. "But not clever enough. Tell me, Feyd, why didn't you strike me down yourself? You've had opportunity enough."
    Feyd-Rautha found a suspensor chair, accomplished a mental shrug as he sat down in it without being asked. 
    I must be bold now, he thought.
    "You taught me that my own hands must remain clean," he said.
    "Ah, yes," the Baron said. "When you face the Emperor, you must be able to say truthfully that you did not do the deed. The witch at the Emperor's elbow will hear your words and know their truth or falsehood. Yes. I warned you about that."
    "Why haven't you ever bought a Bene Gesserit, Uncle?" Feyd-Rautha asked. "With a Truthsayer at your side  --" 
    "You know my tastes!" the Baron snapped.
    Feyd-Rautha studied his uncle, said: "Still, one would be valuable for --"
    "I trust them not!" the Baron snarled. "And stop trying to change the subject!" 
    Feyd-Rautha spoke mildly; "As you wish, Uncle." 
    "I remember a time in the arena several years ago," the Baron said. "It seemed there that day a slave had been set to kill you. Is that truly how it was?" 
    "It's been so long ago, Uncle. After all, I --"
    "No evasions, please," the Baron said, and the tightness of his voice exposed the rein on his anger.
    Feyd-Rautha looked at his uncle, thinking: He knows, else he wouldn't ask.
    "It was a sham, Uncle. I arranged it to discredit your slavemaster."
    "Very clever," the Baron said. "Brave, too. That slave-gladiator almost took you, didn't he?" 
    "Yes."
    "If you had finesse and subtlety to match such courage, you'd be truly formidable." The Baron shook his head from side to side. And as he had done many times since that terrible day on Arrakis, he found himself regretting the loss of Piter, the Mentat. There'd been a man of delicate, devilish subtlety. It hadn't saved him, though. Again, the Baron shook his head. Fate was sometimes inscrutable.
    Feyd-Rautha glanced around the bedchamber, studying the signs of the struggle, wondering how his uncle had overcome the slave they'd prepared so carefully.
    "How did I best him?" the Baron asked. "Ah-h-h, now, Feyd -- let me keep some weapons to preserve me in my old age. It's better we use this time to strike a bargain."
    Feyd-Rautha stared at him. A bargain! He means to keep me as his heir for certain, then. Else why bargain. One bargains with equals or near equals!
    "What bargain, Uncle?" And Feyd-Rautha felt proud that his voice remained calm and reasonable, betraying none of the elation that filled him.
    The Baron, too, noted the control. He nodded. "You're good material, Feyd. I don't waste good material. You persist, however, in refusing to learn my true value to you. You are obstinate. You do not see why I should be preserved as someone of the utmost value to you. This . . . " He gestured at the evidence of the struggle in the bedchamber. "This was foolishness. I do not reward foolishness." 
    Get to the point, you old fool! Feyd-Rautha thought.
    "You think of me as an old fool," the Baron said. "I must dissuade you of that." 
    "You speak of a bargain."
    "Ah, the impatience of youth," the Baron said. "Well, this is the substance of it, then: You will cease these foolish attempts on my life. And I, when you are ready for it, will step aside in your favor. I will retire to an advisory position, leaving you in the seat of power." 
    "Retire, Uncle?"
    "You still think me the fool," the Baron said, "and this but confirms it, eh? You think I'm begging you! Step cautiously, Feyd. This old fool saw through the shielded needle you'd planted in that slave boy's thigh. Right where I'd put my hand on it, eh? The smallest pressure and -- snick! A poison needle in the old fool's palm! Ah-h-h, Feyd . . . "
    The Baron shook his head, thinking: It would've worked, too, if Hawat hadn't warned me. Well, let the lad believe I saw the plot on my own. In a way, I did. I was the one who saved Hawat from the wreckage of Arrakis. And this lad needs greater respect for my prowess.
    Feyd-Rautha remained silent, struggling, with himself. Is he being truthful? Does he really mean to retire? Why not? I'm sure to succeed him one day if I move carefully. He can't live forever. Perhaps it was foolish to try hurrying the process.
    "You speak of a bargain," Feyd-Rautha said. "What pledge do we give to bind it?"
    "How can we trust each other, eh?" the Baron asked. "Well, Feyd, as for you: I'm setting Thufir Hawat to watch over you. I trust Hawat's Mentat capabilities in this. Do you understand me? And as for me, you'll have to take me on faith. But I can't live forever, can I, Feyd? And perhaps you should begin to suspect now that there're things I know which you should know."
    "I give you my pledge and what do you give me?" Feyd-Rautha asked.
    "I let you go on living," the Baron said.
    Again, Feyd-Rautha studied his uncle. He sets Hawat over me! What would he say if I told him Hawat planned the trick with the gladiator that cost him his slavemaster? He'd likely say I was lying in the attempt to discredit Hawat. No, the good Thufir is a Mentat and has anticipated this moment.
    "Well, what do you say?" the Baron asked. 
    "What can I say? I accept, of course."
    And Feyd-Rautha thought: Hawat! He plays both ends against the middle . . . is that it? Has he moved to my uncle's camp because I didn't counsel with him over the slave boy attempt?
    "You haven't said anything about my setting Hawat to watch you," the Baron said.
    Feyd-Rautha betrayed anger by a flaring of nostrils. The name of Hawat had been a danger signal in the Harkonnen family for so many years . . . and now it had a new meaning: still dangerous. 
    "Hawat's a dangerous toy," Feyd-Rautha said.
    "Toy! Don't be stupid. I know what I have in Hawat and how to control it. Hawat has deep emotions, Feyd. The man without emotions is the one to fear. But deep emotions . . . ah, now, those can be bent to your needs." 
    "Uncle, I don't understand you." 
    "Yes, that's plain enough."
    Only a flicker of eyelids betrayed the passage of resentment through Feyd-Rautha.
    "And you do not understand Hawat," the Baron said. 
    Nor do you! Feyd-Rautha thought.
    "Who does Hawat blame for his present circumstances?" the Baron asked. "Me? Certainly. But he was an Atreides tool and bested me for years until the Imperium took a hand. That's how he sees it. His hate for me is a casual thing now. He believes he can best me any time. Believing this, he is bested. For I direct his attention where I want it -- against the Imperium."
    Tensions of a new understanding drew tight lines across Feyd-Rautha's forehead, thinned his mouth. "Against the Emperor?" 
    Let my dear nephew try the taste of that, the Baron thought. Let him say to himself: "The Emperor Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen!" Let him ask himself how much that's worth. Surely it must be worth the life of one old uncle who could make that dream come to pass!
    Slowly, Feyd-Rautha wet his lips with his tongue. Could it be true what the old fool was saying? There was more here than there seemed to be.
    "And what has Hawat to do with this?" Feyd-Rautha asked. 
    "He thinks he uses us to wreak his revenge upon the Emperor." 
    "And when that's accomplished?" 
    "He does not think beyond his revenge. Hawat's a man who must serve others, and doesn't even know this about himself." 
    "I've learned much from Hawat," Feyd-Rautha agreed, and felt the truth of the words as he spoke them. "But the more I learn, the more I feel we should dispose of him . . . and soon." 
    "You don't like the idea of his watching you?" 
    "Hawat watches everybody."
    "And he may put you on a throne. Hawat is subtle. He is dangerous, devious. But I'll not yet withhold the antidote from him. A sword is dangerous, too, Feyd. We have the scabbard for this one, though. The poison's in him. When we withdraw the antidote, death will sheathe him."
    "In a way, it's like the arena," Feyd-Rautha said. "Feints within feints within feints. You watch to see which way the gladiator leans, which way he looks, how he holds his knife."
    He nodded to himself, seeing that these words pleased his uncle, but thinking: Yes! Like the arena! And the cutting edge is the mind!
    "Now you see how you need me," the Baron said. "I'm yet of use, Feyd."
    A sword to be wielded until he's too blunt for use, Feyd-Rautha thought.
    "Yes, Uncle, "he said.
    "And now," the Baron said, "we will go down to the slave quarters, we two. And I will watch while you, with your own hands, kill all the women in the pleasure wing."
    "Uncle!"
    "There will be other women, Feyd. But I have said that you do not make a mistake casually with me." 
    Feyd-Rautha's face darkened. "Uncle, you --" 
    "You will accept your punishment and learn something from it," the Baron said.
    Feyd-Rautha met the gloating stare in his uncle's eyes. And I must remember this night, he thought. And remembering it, I must remember other nights.
    "You will not refuse," the Baron said.
    What could you do if I refused, old man? Feyd-Rautha asked himself. But he knew there might be some other punishment, perhaps a more subtle one, a more brutal lever to bend him. 
    "I know you, Feyd," the Baron said. "You will not refuse." 
    All right, Feyd-Rautha thought. I need you now. I see that. The bargain's made. But I'll not always need you. And . . . someday . . .

Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.
-from "The Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    I've sat across from many rulers of Great Houses, but never seen a more gross and dangerous pig than this one, Thufir Hawat told himself.
    "You may speak plainly with me, Hawat," the Baron rumbled. He leaned back in his suspensor chair, the eyes in their folds of fat boring into Hawat.
    The old Mentat looked down at the table between him and the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, noting the opulence of its grain. Even this was a factor to consider in assessing the Baron, as were the red walls of this private conference room and the faint sweet herb scent that hung on the air, masking a deeper musk.
    "You didn't have me send that warning to Rabban as an idle whim," the Baron said.
    Hawat's leathery old face remained impassive, betraying none of the loathing he felt. "I suspect many things, my Lord," he said.
    "Yes. Well, I wish to know how Arrakis figures in your suspicions about Salusa Secundus. It is not enough that you say to me the Emperor is in a ferment about some association between Arrakis and his mysterious prison planet. Now, I rushed the warning out to Rabban only because the courier had to leave on that Heighliner. You said there could be no delay. Well and good. But now I will have an explanation."
    He babbles too much, Hawat thought. He's not like Leto who could tell me a thing with the lift of an eyebrow or the wave of a hand. Nor like the Old Duke who could express an entire sentence in the way he accented a single word. This is a clod! Destroying him will be a service to mankind.
    "You will not leave here until I've had a full and complete explanation," the Baron said.
    "You speak too casually of Salusa Secundus," Hawat said.
    "It's a penal colony," the Baron said. "The worst riff-raff in the galaxy are sent to Salusa Secundus. What else do we need to know?"
    "That conditions on the prison planet are more oppressive than anywhere else," Hawat said. "You hear that the mortality rate among new prisoners is higher than sixty per cent. You hear that the Emperor practices every form of oppression there. You hear all this and do not ask questions?"
    "The Emperor doesn't permit the Great Houses to inspect his prison," the Baron growled. "But he hasn't seen into my dungeons, either."
    "And curiosity about Salusa Secundus is . . . ah . . . " Hawat put a bony finger to his lips. ". . . discouraged." 
    "So he's not proud of some of the things he must do there!" 
    Hawat allowed the faintest of smiles to touch his dark lips. His eyes glinted in the glowtube light as he stared at the Baron. "And you've never wondered where the Emperor gets his Sardaukar?" 
    The Baron pursed his fat lips. This gave his features the look of a pouting baby, and his voice carried a tone of petulance as he said: "Why . . . he recruits . . . that is to say, there are the levies and he enlists from --"
    "Faaa!" Hawat snapped. "The stories you hear about the exploits of the Sardaukar, they're not rumors, are they? Those are first-hand accounts from the limited number of survivors who've fought against the Sardaukar, eh?"
    "The Sardaukar are excellent fighting men, no doubt of it," the Baron said. "But I think my own legions --"
    "A pack of holiday excursionists by comparison!" Hawat snarled. "You think I don't know why the Emperor turned against House Atreides?"
    "This is not a realm open to your speculation," the Baron warned.
    Is it possible that even he doesn't know what motivated the Emperor in this? Hawat asked himself.
    "Any area is open to my speculation if it does what you've hired me to do," Hawat said. "I am a Mentat. You do not withhold information or computation lines from a Mentat." 
    For a long minute, the Baron stared at him, then: "Say what you must say. Mentat."
    "The Padishah Emperor turned against House Atreides because the Duke's Warmasters Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho had trained a fighting force -- a small fighting force -- to within a hair as good as the Sardaukar. Some of them were even better. And the Duke was in a position to enlarge his force, to make it every bit as strong as the Emperor's."
    The Baron weighed this disclosure, then: "What has Arrakis to do with this?"
    "It provides a pool of recruits already conditioned to the bitterest survival training." 
    The Baron shook his head. "You cannot mean the Fremen?" 
    "I mean the Fremen."
    "Hah! Then why warn Rabban? There cannot be more than a handful of Fremen left after the Sardaukar pogrom and Rabban's oppression." 
    Hawat continued to stare at him silently.
    "Not more than a handful!" the baron repeated. "Rabban killed six thousand of them last year alone!" 
    Still, Hawat stared at him.
    "And the year before it was nine thousand," the baron said. "And before they left, the Sardaukar must've accounted for at least twenty thousand."
    "What are Rabban's troop losses for the past two years?" Hawat asked.
    The Baron rubbed his jowls. "Well, he has been recruiting rather heavily, to be sure. His agents make rather extravagant promises and --" 
    "Shall we say thirty thousand in round numbers?" Hawat asked. 
    "That would seem a little high," the baron said.
    "Quite the contrary," Hawat said. "I can read between the lines of Rabban's reports as well as you can. And you certainly must've understood my reports from our agents."
    "Arrakis is a fierce planet," the Baron said. "Storm losses can --" 
    "We both know the figure for storm accretion," Hawat said.
    "What if he has lost thirty thousand?" the Baron demanded, and blood darkened his face.
    "By your own count," Hawat said, "he killed fifteen thousand over two years while losing twice that number. You say the Sardaukar accounted for another twenty thousand, possibly a few more. And I've seen the transportation manifests for their return from Arrakis. If they killed twenty thousand, they lost almost five for one. Why won't you face these figures, Baron, and understand what they mean?"
    The Baron spoke in a coldly measured cadence: "This is your job, Mentat. What do they mean?"
    "I gave you Duncan Idaho's head count on the sietch he visited," Hawat said. "It all fits. If they had just two hundred and fifty such sietch communities, their population would be about five million. My best estimate is that they had at least twice that many communities. You scatter your population on such a planet." 
    "Ten million?" The Baron's jowls quivered with amazement. 
    "At least."
    The Baron pursed his fat lips. The beady eyes stared without wavering at Hawat. Is this true Mentat computation? he wondered. How could this be and no one suspect?
    "We haven't even cut heavily into their birth-rate-growth figure," Hawat said. "We've just weeded out some of their less successful specimens, leaving the strong to grow stronger -- just like on Salusa Secundus."
    "Salusa Secundus!" the Baron barked. "What has this to do with the Emperor's prison planet?"
    "A man who survives Salusa Secundus starts out being tougher than most others," Hawat said. "When you add the very best of military training --"
    "Nonsense! By your argument, I could recruit from among the Fremen after the way they've been oppressed by my nephew." 
    Hawat spoke in a mild voice: "Don't you oppress any of your troops?" 
    "Well . . . I . . . but --"
    "Oppression is a relative thing," Hawat said. "Your fighting men are much better off than those around them, heh? They see unpleasant alternative to being soldiers of the Baron, heh?" 
    The Baron fell silent, eyes unfocused. The possibilities -- had Rabban unwittingly given House Harkonnen its ultimate weapon?
    Presently he said: "How could you be sure of the loyalty of such recruits?"
    "I would take them in small groups, not larger than platoon strength," Hawat said. "I'd remove them from their oppressive situation and isolate them with a training cadre of people who understood their background, preferably people who had preceded them from the same oppressive situation. Then I'd fill them with the mystique that their planet had really been a secret training ground to produce just such superior beings as themselves. And all the while, I'd show them what such superior beings could earn: rich living, beautiful women, fine mansions . . . whatever they desired." 
    The Baron began to nod. "The way the Sardaukar live at home." 
    "The recruits come to believe in time that such a place as Salusa Secundus is justified because it produced them -- the elite. The commonest Sardaukar trooper lives a life, in many respects, as exalted as that of any member of a Great House." 
    "Such an idea!" the Baron whispered.
    "You begin to share my suspicions," Hawat said. 
    "Where did such a thing start?" the Baron asked.
    "Ah, yes: Where did House Corrino originate? Were there people on Salusa Secundus before the Emperor sent his first contingents of prisoners there? Even the Duke Leto, a cousin on the distaff side, never knew for sure. Such questions are not encouraged."
    The Baron's eyes glazed with thought. "Yes, a very carefully kept secret. They'd use every device of --"
    "Besides, what's there to conceal?" Hawat asked. "That the Padishah Emperor has a prison planet? Everyone knows this. That he has --" 
    "Count Fenring!" the Baron blurted.
    Hawat broke off, studied the Baron with a puzzled frown. "What of Count Fenring?"
    "At my nephew's birthday several years ago," the Baron said. "This Imperial popinjay. Count Fenring, came as official observer and to . . . ah, conclude a business arrangement between the Emperor and myself." 
    "So?"
    "I . . . ah, during one of our conversations, I believe I said something about making a prison planet of Arrakis. Fenring --" 
    "What did you say exactly?" Hawat asked. 
    "Exactly? That was quite a while ago and --"
    "My Lord Baron, if you wish to make the best use of my services, you must give me adequate information. Wasn't this conversation recorded?"
    The Baron's face darkened with anger. "You're as bad as Piter! I don't like these --"
    "Piter is no longer with you my Lord," Hawat said. "As to that, whatever did happen to Piter?"
    "He became too familiar, too demanding of me," the Baron said.
    "You assure me you don't waste a useful man," Hawat said. "Will you waste me by threats and quibbling? We were discussing what you said to Count Fenring."
    Slowly, the Baron composed his features. When the time comes, he thought, I'll remember his manner with me. Yes. I will remember.
    "One moment," the Baron said, and he thought back to the meeting in his great hall. It helped to visualize the cone of silence in which they had stood. "I said something like this," the Baron said. "The Emperor knows a certain amount of killing has always been an arm of business.' I was referring to our work force losses. Then I said something about considering another solution to the Arrakeen problem and I said the Emperor's prison planet inspired me to emulate him." 
    "Witch blood!" Hawat snapped. "What did Fenring say?" 
    "That's when he began questioning me about you." 
    Hawat sat back, closed his eyes in thought. "So that's why they started looking into Arrakis," he said. "Well, the thing's done." He opened his eyes. "They must have spies all over Arrakis by now. Two years!" 
    "But certainly my innocent suggestion that --" 
    "Nothing is innocent in an Emperor's eyes! What were your instructions to Rabban?" 
    "Merely that he should teach Arrakis to fear us." 
    Hawat shook his head. "You now have two alternatives, Baron. You can kill off the natives, wipe them out entirely, or --" 
    "Waste an entire work force?"
    "Would you prefer to have the Emperor and those Great Houses he can still swing behind him come in here and perform a curettement, scrape out Giedi Prime like a hollow gourd?" 
    The Baron studied his Mentat, then: "He wouldn't dare!" 
    "Wouldn't he?" 
    The Baron's lips quivered. "What is your alternative?" 
    "Abandon your dear nephew, Rabban." 
    "Aband . . . " The Baron broke off, stared at Hawat.
    "Send him no more troops, no aid of any kind. Don't answer his messages other than to say you've heard of the terrible way he's handled things on Arrakis and you intend to take corrective measures as soon as you're able. I'll arrange to have some of your messages intercepted by Imperial spies." 
    "But what of the spice, the revenues, the --"
    "Demand your baronial profits, but be careful how you make your demands. Require fixed sums of Rabban. We can --" 
    The Baron turned his hands palms up. "But how can I be certain that my weasel nephew isn't --"
    "We still have our spies on Arrakis. Tell Rabban he either meets the spice quotas you set him or he'll be replaced." 
    "I know my nephew," the Baron said. "This would only make him oppress the population even more."
    "Of course he will!" Hawat snapped. "You don't want that stopped now! You merely want your own hands clean. Let Rabban make your Salusa Secundus for you. There's no need even to send him any prisoners. He has all the population required. If Rabban is driving his people to meet your spice quotas, then the Emperor need suspect no other motive. That's reason enough for putting the planet on the rack. And you, Baron, will not show by word or action that there's any other reason for this."
    The Baron could not keep the sly tone of admiration out of his voice. "Ah, Hawat, you are a devious one. Now, how do we move into Arrakis and make use of what Rabban prepares?" 
    "That's the simplest thing of all, Baron. If you set each year's quota a bit higher than the one before, matters will soon reach a head there. Production will drop off. You can remove Rabban and take over yourself . . . to correct the mess."
    "It fits," the Baron said. "But I can feel myself tiring of all this. I'm preparing another to take over Arrakis for me." 
    Hawat studied the fat round face across from him. Slowly the old soldier-spy began to nod his head. "Feyd-Rautha," he said. "So that's the reason for the oppression now. You're very devious yourself, Baron. Perhaps we can incorporate these two schemes. Yes. Your Feyd-Rautha can go to Arrakis as their savior. He can win the populace. Yes."
    The Baron smiled. And behind his smile, he asked himself: Now, how does this fit in with Hawat's personal scheming?
    And Hawat, seeing that he was dismissed, arose and left the red-walled room. As he walked, he could not put down the disturbing unknowns that cropped into every computation about Arrakis. This new religious leader that Gurney Halleck hinted at from his hiding place among the smugglers, this Muad'Dib.
    Perhaps I should not have told the Baron to let this religion flourish where it will, even among the folk of pan and graben, he told himself. But it's well known that repression makes a religion flourish.
    And he thought about Halleck's reports on Fremen battle tactics. The tactics smacked of Halleck himself . . . and Idaho . . . and even of Hawat.
    Did Idaho survive? he asked himself.
    But this was a futile question. He did not yet ask himself if it was possible that Paul had survived. He knew the Baron was convinced that all Atreides were dead. The Bene Gesserit witch had been his weapon, the Baron admitted. And that could only mean an end to all -- even to the woman's own son.
    What a poisonous hate she must've had for the Atreides, he thought. Something like the hate I hold for this Baron. Will my blow be as final and complete as hers?

There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace -- those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death.
-from "The Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    Paul-Muad'Dib remembered that there had been a meal heavy with spice essence. He clung to this memory because it was an anchor point and he could tell himself from this vantage that his immediate experience must be a dream.
    I am a theater of processes, he told himself. I am a prey to the imperfect vision, to the race consciousness and its terrible purpose.
    Yet, he could not escape the fear that he had somehow overrun himself, lost his position in time, so that past and future and present mingled without distinction. It was a kind of visual fatigue and it came, he knew, from the constant necessity of holding the prescient future as a kind of memory that was in itself a thing intrinsically of the past.
    Chani prepared the meal for me, he told himself.
    Yet Chani was deep in the south -- in the cold country where the sun was hot -- secreted in one of the new sietch strongholds, safe with their son, Leto II.
    Or, was that a thing yet to happen?
    No, he reassured himself, for Alia-the-Strange-One, his sister, had gone there with his mother and with Chani -- a twenty-thumper trip into the south, riding a Reverend Mother's palanquin fixed to the back of a wild maker.
    He shied away from thought of riding the giant worms, asking himself: Or is Alia yet to be born?
    I was on razzia, Paul recalled. We went raiding to recover the water of our dead in Arrakeen. And I found the remains of my father in the funeral pyre. I enshrined the skull of my father in a Fremen rock mound overlooking Harg Pass.
    Or was that a thing yet to be?
    My wounds are real, Paul told himself. My scars are real. The shrine of my father's skull is real.
    Still in the dreamlike state, Paul remembered that Harah, Jamis' wife, had intruded on him once to say there'd been a fight in the sietch corridor. That had been the interim sietch before the women and children had been sent into the deep south. Harah had stood there in the entrance to the inner chamber, the black wings of her hair tied back by water rings on a chain. She had held aside the chamber's hangings and told him that Chani had just killed someone.
    This happened, Paul told himself. This was real, not born out of its time and subject to change.
    Paul remembered he had rushed out to find Chani standing beneath the yellow globes of the corridor, clad in a brilliant blue wraparound robe with hood thrown back, a flush of exertion on her elfin features. She had been sheathing her crysknife. A huddled group had been hurrying away down the corridor with a burden.
    And Paul remembered telling himself: You always know when they're carrying a body.
    Chani's water rings, worn openly in sietch on a cord around her neck, tinkled as she turned toward him. 
    "Chani, what is this?" he asked.
    "I dispatched one who came to challenge you in single combat, Usul." 
    "You killed him?" 
    "Yes. But perhaps I should've left him for Harah." 
    (And Paul recalled how the faces of the people around them had showed appreciation for these words. Even Harah had laughed.) 
    "But he came to challenge me!" 
    "You trained me yourself in the weirding way, Usul." 
    "Certainly! But you shouldn't --" 
    "I was born in the desert, Usul. I know how to use a crysknife." 
    He suppressed his anger, tried to talk reasonably. "This may all be true, Chani, but --"
    "I am no longer a child hunting scorpions in the sietch by the light of a handglobe, Usul. I do not play games."
    Paul glared at her, caught by the odd ferocity beneath her casual attitude.
    "He was not worthy, Usul," Chani said. "I'd not disturb your meditations with the likes of him." She moved closer, looking at him out of the corners of her eyes, dropping her voice so that only he might hear. "And, beloved, when it's learned that a challenger may face me and be brought to shameful death by Muad'Dib's woman, there'll be fewer challengers."
    Yes, Paul told himself, that had certainly happened. It was true-past. And the number of challengers testing the new blade of Muad'Dib did drop dramatically.
    Somewhere, in a world not-of-the-dream, there was a hint of motion, the cry of a nightbird.
    I dream, Paul reassured himself. It's the spice meal.
    Still, there was about him a feeling of abandonment. He wondered it if might be possible that his ruh-spirit had slipped over somehow into the world where the Fremen believed he had his true existence -- into the alam al-mithal, the world of similitudes, that metaphysical realm where all physical limitations were removed. And he knew fear at the thought of such a place, because removal of all limitations meant removal of all points of reference. In the landscape of a myth he could not orient himself and say: "I am I because I am here."
    His mother had said once: "The people are divided, some of them, in how they think of you."
    I must be waking from the dream, Paul told himself. For this had happened -- these words from his mother, the Lady Jessica who was now a Reverend Mother of the Fremen, these words had passed through reality.
    Jessica was fearful of the religious relationship between himself and the Fremen, Paul knew. She didn't like the fact that people of both sietch and graben referred to Muad'Dib as Him. And she went questioning among the tribes, sending out her Sayyadina spies, collecting their answers and brooding on them.
    She had quoted a Bene Gesserit proverb to him: "When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movement become headlong -- faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thought of obstacles and forget that a precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late."
    Paul recalled that he had sat there in his mother's quarters, in the inner chamber shrouded by dark hangings with their surfaces covered by woven patterns out of Fremen mythology. He had sat there, hearing her out, noting the way she was always observing -- even when her eyes were lowered. Her oval face had new lines in it at the corners of the mouth, but the hair was still like polished bronze. The wide-set green eyes, though, hid beneath their over-casting of spice-imbued blue.
    "The Fremen have a simple, practical religion," he said. 
    "Nothing about religion is simple," she warned.
    But Paul, seeing the clouded future that still hung over them, found himself swayed by anger. He could only say: "Religion unifies our forces. It's our mystique."
    "You deliberately cultivate this air, this bravura," she charged. "You never cease indoctrinating." 
    "Thus you yourself taught me," he said.
    But she had been full of contentions and arguments that day. It had been the day of the circumcision ceremony for little Leto. Paul had understood some of the reasons for her upset. She had never accepted his liaison -- the "marriage of youth" -- with Chani. But Chani had produced an Atreides son, and Jessica had found herself unable to reject the child with the mother.
    Jessica had stirred finally under his stare, said: "You think me an unnatural mother." 
    "Of course not."
    "I see the way you watch me when I'm with your sister. You don't understand about your sister."
    "I know why Alia is different," he said. "She was unborn, part of you, when you changed the Water of Life. She --" 
    "You know nothing of it!"
    And Paul, suddenly unable to express the knowledge gained out of its time, said only: "I don't think you unnatural." 
    She saw his distress, said: "There is a thing, Son." 
    "Yes?" 
    "I do love your Chani. I accept her."
    This was real, Paul told himself. This wasn't the imperfect vision to be changed by the twistings out of time's own birth.
    The reassurance gave him a new hold on his world. Bits of solid reality began to dip through the dream state into his awareness. He knew suddenly that he was in a hiereg, a desert camp. Chani had planted their stilltent on flour-sand for its softness. That could only mean Chani was near by -- Chani, his soul, Chani his Sihaya, sweet as the desert spring, Chani up from the palmaries of the deep south.
    Now, he remembered her singing a sand chanty to him in the time for sleep.

"O my soul, 
Have no taste for Paradise this night, 
And I swear by Shai-hulud 
You will go there, 
Obedient to my love."

    And she had sung the walking song lovers shared on the sand, its rhythm like the drag of the dunes against the feet:

"Tell me of thine eyes 
And I will tell thee of thy heart. 
Tell me of thy feet 
And I will tell thee of thy hands. 
Tell me of thy sleeping 
And I will tell thee of thy waking. 
Tell me of thy desires
And I will tell thee of thy need."

    He had heard someone strumming a baliset in another tent. And he'd thought then of Gurney Halleck. Reminded by the familiar instrument, he had thought of Gurney whose face he had seen in a smuggler band, but who had not seen him, could not see him or know of him lest that inadvertently lead the Harkonnens to the son of the Duke they had killed.
    But the style of the player in the night, the distinctiveness of the fingers on the baliset's strings, brought the real musician back to Paul's memory. It had been Chatt the Leaper, captain of the Fedaykin, leader of the death commandos who guarded Muad'Dib.
    We are in the desert, Paul remembered. We are in the central erg beyond the Harkonnen patrols. I am here to walk the sand, to lure a maker and mount him by my own cunning that I may be a Fremen entire.
    He felt now the maula pistol at his belt, the crysknife. He felt the silence surrounding him.
    It was that special pre-morning silence when the nightbirds had gone and the day creatures had not yet signaled their alertness to their enemy, the sun.
    "You must ride the sand in the light of day that Shai-hulud shall see and know you have no fear," Stilgar had said. "Thus we turn our time around and set ourselves to sleep this night." 
    Quietly, Paul sat up, feeling the looseness of a slacked stillsuit around his body, the shadowed stilltent beyond. So softly he moved, yet Chani heard him.
    She spoke from the tent's gloom, another shadow there: "It's not yet full light, beloved." 
    "Sihaya," he said, speaking with half a laugh in his voice.
    "You call me your desert spring," she said, "but this day I'm thy goad. I am the Sayyadina who watches that the rites be obeyed." 
    He began tightening his stillsuit. "You told me once the words of the Kitab al-Ibar," he said. "You told me: 'Woman is thy field; go then to thy field and till it.' "
    "I am the mother of thy firstborn," she agreed.
    He saw her in the grayness matching him movement for movement, securing her stillsuit for the open desert. "You should get all the rest you can," she said.
    He recognized her love for him speaking then and chided her gently: "The Sayyadina of the Watch does not caution or warn the candidate."
    She slid across to his side, touched his cheek with her palm. "Today, I am both the watcher and the woman." 
    "You should've left this duty to another," he said.
    "Waiting is bad enough at best," she said. "I'd sooner be at thy side."
    He kissed her palm before securing the faceflap of his suit, then turned and cracked the seal of the tent. The air that came in to them held the chill not-quite-dryness that would precipitate trace dew in the dawn. With it came the smell of a pre-spice mass, the mass they had detected off to the northeast, and that told them there would be a maker near by.
    Paul crawled through the sphincter opening, stood on the sand and stretched the sleep from his muscles. A faint green-pearl luminescence etched the eastern horizon. The tents of his troop were small false dunes around him in the gloom. He saw movement off to the left -- the guard, and knew they had seen him.
    They knew the peril he faced this day. Each Fremen had faced it. They gave him this last few moments of isolation now that he might prepare himself.
    It must be done today, he told himself.
    He thought of the power he wielded in the face of the pogrom -- the old men who sent their sons to him to be trained in the weirding way of battle, the old men who listened to him now in council and followed his plans, the men who returned to pay him that highest Fremen compliment: "Your plan worked, Muad'Dib." 
    Yet the meanest and smallest of the Fremen warriors could do a thing that he had never done. And Paul knew his leadership suffered from the omnipresent knowledge of this difference between them. 
    He had not ridden the maker.
    Oh, he'd gone up with the others for training trips and raids, but he had not made his own voyage. Until he did, his world was bounded by the abilities of others. No true Fremen could permit this. Until he did this thing himself, even the great southlands -- the area some twenty thumpers beyond the erg -- were denied him unless he ordered a palanquin and rode like a Reverend Mother or one of the sick and wounded.
    Memory returned to him of his wrestling with his inner awareness during the night. He saw a strange parallel here -- if he mastered the maker, his rule was strengthened; if he mastered the inward eye, this carried its own measure of command. But beyond them both lay the clouded area, the Great Unrest where all the universe seemed embroiled.
    The differences in the ways he comprehended the universe haunted him -- accuracy matched with inaccuracy. He saw it in situ. Yet, when it was born, when it came into the pressures of reality, the now had its own life and grew with its own subtle differences. Terrible purpose remained. Race consciousness remained. And over all loomed the jihad, bloody and wild.
    Chani joined him outside the tent, hugging her elbows, looking up at him from the corners of her eyes the way she did when she studied his mood.
    "Tell me again about the waters of thy birthworld, Usul," she said.
    He saw that she was trying to distract him, ease his mind of tensions before the deadly test. It was growing lighter, and he noted that some of his Fedaykin were already striking their tents.
    "I'd rather you told me about the sietch and about our son," he said. "Does our Leto yet hold my mother in his palm?" 
    "It's Alia he holds as well," she said. "And he grows rapidly. He'll be a big man." 
    "What's it like in the south?" he asked.
    "When you ride the maker you'll see for yourself," she said. 
    "But I wish to see it first through your eyes." 
    "It's powerfully lonely," she said.
    He touched the nezhoni scarf at her forehead where it protruded from her stillsuit cap. "Why will you not talk about the sietch?" 
    "I have talked about it. The sietch is a lonely place without our men. It's a place of work. We labor in the factories and the potting rooms. There are weapons to be made, poles to plant that we may forecast the weather, spice to collect for the bribes. There are dunes to be planted to make them grow and to anchor them. There are fabrics and rugs to make, fuel cells to charge. There are children to train that the tribe's strength may never be lost." 
    "Is nothing then pleasant in the sietch?" he asked.
    "The children are pleasant. We observe the rites. We have sufficient food. Sometimes one of us may come north to be with her man. Life must go on."
    "My sister, Alia -- is she accepted yet by the people?" 
    Chani turned toward him in the growing dawnlight. Her eyes bored into him. "It's a thing to be discussed another time, beloved." 
    "Let us discuss it now." 
    "You should conserve your energies for the test," she said.
    He saw that he had touched something sensitive, hearing the withdrawal in her voice. "The unknown brings its own worries," he said.
    Presently she nodded, said, "There is yet . . . misunderstanding because of Alia's strangeness. The women are fearful because a child little more than an infant talks . . . of things that only an adult should know. They do not understand the . . . change in the womb that made Alia . . . different."
    "There is trouble?" he asked. And he thought: I've seen visions of trouble over Alia.
    Chani looked toward the growing line of the sunrise. "Some of the women banded to appeal to the Reverend Mother. They demanded she exorcise the demon in her daughter. They quoted the scripture: 'Suffer not a witch to live among us.' "
    "And what did my mother say to them?"
    "She recited the law and sent the women away abashed. She said: 'If Alia incites trouble, it is the fault of authority for not foreseeing and preventing the trouble.' And she tried to explain how the change had worked on Alia in the womb. But the women were angry because they had been embarrassed. They went away muttering." 
    There will be trouble because of Alia, he thought.
    A crystal blowing of sand touched the exposed portions of his face, bringing the scent of the pre-spice mass. "El Sayal, the rain of sand that brings the morning," he said.
    He looked out across the gray light of the desert landscape, the landscape beyond pity, the sand that was form absorbed in itself. Dry lightning streaked a dark corner to the south -- sign that a storm had built up its static charge there. The roll of thunder boomed long after.
    "The voice that beautifies the land," Chani said.
    More of his men were stirring out of their tents. Guards were coming in from the rims. Everything around him moved smoothly in the ancient routine that required no orders.
    "Give as few orders as possible," his father had told him . . . once . . . long ago. "Once you've given orders on a subject, you must always give orders on that subject."
    The Fremen knew this rule instinctively.
    The troop's watermaster began the morning chanty, adding to it now the call for the rite to initiate a sandrider.
    "The world is a carcass," the man chanted, his voice wailing across the dunes. "Who can turn away the Angel of Death? What Shai-hulud has decreed must be."
    Paul listened, recognizing that these were the words that also began the death chant of his Fedaykin, the words the death commandos recited as they buried themselves into battle.
    Will there be a rock shrine here this day to mark the passing of another soul? Paul asked himself. Will Fremen stop here in the future, each to add another stone and think on Muad'Dib who died in this place?
    He knew this was among the alternatives today, a fact along lines of the future radiating from this position in time-space. The imperfect vision plagued him. The more he resisted his terrible purpose and fought against the coming of the jihad, the greater the turmoil that wove through his prescience. His entire future was becoming like a river hurtling toward a chasm -- the violent nexus beyond which all was fog and clouds.
    "Stilgar approaches," Chani said. "I must stand apart now, beloved. Now, I must be Sayyadina and observe the rite that it may be reported truly in the Chronicles." She looked up at him and, for a moment, her reserve slipped, then she had herself under control. "When this is past, I shall prepare thy breakfast with my own hands," she said. She turned away.
    Stilgar moved toward him across the flour sand, stirring up little dust puddles. The dark niches of his eyes remained steady on Paul with their untamed stare. The glimpse of black beard above the stillsuit mask, the lines of craggy cheeks, could have been wind-etched from the native rock for all their movement.
    The man carried Paul's banner on its staff -- the green and black banner with a water tube in the staff -- that already was a legend in the land. Half pridefully, Paul thought: I cannot do the simplest thing without its becoming a legend. They will mark how I parted from Chani, how I greet Stilgar -- every move I make this day. Live or die, it is a legend. I must not die. Then it will be only legend and nothing to stop the jihad.
    Stilgar planted the staff in the sand beside Paul, dropped his hands to his sides. The blue-within-blue eyes remained level and intent. And Paul thought how his own eyes already were assuming this mask of color from the spice.
    "They denied us the Hajj," Stilgar said with ritual solemnity.
    As Chani had taught him, Paul responded: "Who can deny a Fremen the right to walk or ride where he wills?" 
    "I am a Naib," Stilgar said, "never to be taken alive. I am a leg of the death tripod that will destroy our foes."
    Silence settled over them.
    Paul glanced at the other Fremen scattered over the sand beyond Stilgar, the way they stood without moving for this moment of personal prayer. And he thought of how the Fremen were a people whose living consisted of killing, an entire people who had lived with rage and grief all of their days, never once considering what might take the place of either -- except for a dream with which Liet-Kynes had infused them before his death.
    "Where is the Lord who led us through the land of desert and of pits?" Stilgar asked.
    "He is ever with us," the Fremen chanted.
    Stilgar squared his shoulders, stepped closer to Paul and lowered his voice. "Now, remember what I told you. Do it simply and directly -- nothing fancy. Among our people, we ride the maker at the age of twelve. You are more than six years beyond that age and not born to this life. You don't have to impress anyone with your courage. We know you are brave. All you must do is call the maker and ride him." 
    "I will remember," Paul said.
    "See that you do. I'll not have you shame my teaching." 
    Stilgar pulled a plastic rod about a meter long from beneath his robe. The thing was pointed at one end, had a spring-wound clapper at the other end. "I prepared this thumper myself. It's a good one. Take it."
    Paul felt the warm smoothness of the plastic as he accepted the thumper.
    "Shishakli has your hooks," Stilgar said. "He'll hand them to you as you step out onto that dune over there." He pointed to his right. "Call a big maker, Usul. Show us the way." 
    Paul marked the tone of Stilgar's voice -- half ritual and half that of a worried friend.
    In that instant, the sun seemed to bound above the horizon. The sky took on the silvered gray-blue that warned this would be a day of extreme heat and dryness even for Arrakis.
    "It is the time of the scalding day," Stilgar said, and now his voice was entirely ritual. "Go, Usul, and ride the maker, travel the sand as a leader of men."
    Paul saluted his banner, noting how the green and black flag hung limply now that the dawn wind had died. He turned toward the dune Stilgar had indicated -- a dirty tan slope with an S-track crest. Already, most of the troop was moving out in the opposite direction, climbing the other dune that had sheltered their camp.
    One robed figure remained in Paul's path: Shishakli, a squad leader of the Fedaykin, only his slope-lidded eyes visible between stillsuit cap and mask.
    Shishakli presented two thin, whiplike shafts as Paul approached. The shafts were about a meter and a half long with glistening plasteel hoods at one end, roughened at the other end for a firm grip.
    Paul accepted them both in his left hand as required by the ritual.
    "They are my own hooks," Shishakli said in a husky voice. "They never have failed."
    Paul nodded, maintaining the necessary silence, moved past the man and up the dune slope. At the crest, he glanced back, saw the troop scattering like a flight of insects, their robes fluttering. He stood alone now on the sandy ridge with only the horizon in front of him, the flat and unmoving horizon. This was a good dune Stilgar had chosen, higher than its companions for the viewpoint vantage.
    Stooping, Paul planted the thumper deep into the windward face where the sand was compacted and would give maximum transmission to the drumming. Then he hesitated, reviewing the lessons, reviewing the life-and-death necessities that faced him.
    When he threw the latch, the thumper would begin its summons. Across the sand, a giant worm -- a maker -- would hear and come to the drumming. With the whiplike hook-staffs, Paul knew, he could mount the maker's high curving back. For as long as a forward edge of a worm's ring segment was held open by a hook, open to admit abrasive sand into the more sensitive interior, the creature would not retreat beneath the desert. It would, in fact, roll its gigantic body to bring the opened segment as far away from the desert surface as possible.
    I am a sandrider, Paul told himself.
    He glanced down at the hooks in his left hand, thinking that he had only to shift those hooks down the curve of a maker's immense side to make the creature roll and turn, guiding it where he willed. He had seen it done. He had been helped up the side of a worm for a short ride in training. The captive worm could be ridden until it lay exhausted and quiescent upon the desert surface and a new maker must be summoned.
    Once he was past this test, Paul knew, he was qualified to make the twenty-thumper journey into the southland -- to rest and restore himself -- into the south where the women and the families had been hidden from the pogrom among the new palmaries and sietch warrens.
    He lifted his head and looked to the south, reminding himself that the maker summoned wild from the erg was an unknown quantity, and the one who summoned it was equally unknown to this test.
    "You must gauge the approaching maker carefully," Stilgar had explained. "You must stand close enough that you can mount it as it passes, yet not so close that it engulfs you."
    With abrupt decision, Paul released the thumper's latch. The clapper began revolving and the summons drummed through the sand, a measured "lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . " 
    He straightened, scanning the horizon, remembering Stilgar's words: "Judge the line of approach carefully. Remember, a worm seldom makes an unseen approach to a thumper. Listen all the same. You may often hear it before you see it."
    And Chani's words of caution, whispered at night when her fear for him overcame her, filled his mind: "When you take your stand along the maker's path, you must remain utterly still. You must think like a patch of sand. Hide beneath your cloak and become a little dune in your very essence."
    Slowly, he scanned the horizon, listening, watching for the signs he had been taught.
    It came from the southeast, a distant hissing, a sand-whisper. Presently he saw the faraway outline of the creature's track against the dawnlight and realized he had never before seen a maker this large, never heard of one this size. It appeared to be more than half a league long, and the rise of the sandwave at its cresting head was like the approach of a mountain.
    This is nothing I have seen by vision or in life, Paul cautioned himself. He hurried across the path of the thing to take his stand, caught up entirely by the rushing needs of this moment.

-Muad'Dib's Secret Message to the Landsraad from "Arrakis Awakening" by the Princess Irulan

    A thought came unbidden to Jessica's mind: Paul will be undergoing his sandrider test at any moment now. They try to conceal this fact from me, but it's obvious. 
    And Chani has gone on some mysterious errand.
    Jessica sat in her resting chamber, catching a moment of quiet between the night's classes. It was a pleasant chamber, but not as large as the one she had enjoyed in Sietch Tabr before their flight from the pogrom. Still, this place had thick rugs on the floor, soft cushions, a low coffee table near at hand, multicolored hangings on the walls, and soft yellow glowglobes overhead. The room was permeated with the distinctive acrid furry odor of a Fremen sietch that she had come to associate with a sense of security.
    Yet she knew she would never overcome a feeling of being in an alien place. It was the harshness that the rugs and hangings attempted to conceal.
    A faint tinkling-drumming-slapping penetrated to the resting chamber. Jessica knew it for a birth celebration, probably Subiay's. Her time was near. And Jessica knew she'd see the baby soon enough -- a blue-eyed cherub brought to the Reverend Mother for blessing. She knew also that her daughter, Alia, would be at the celebration and would report on it.
    It was not yet time for the nightly prayer of parting. They wouldn't have started a birth celebration near the time of ceremony that mourned the slave raids of Poritrin, Bela Tegeuse, Rossak, and Harmonthep.
    Jessica sighed. She knew she was trying to keep her thoughts off her son and the dangers he faced -- the pit traps with their poisoned barbs, the Harkonnen raids (although these were growing fewer as the Fremen took their toll of aircraft and raiders with the new weapons Paul had given them), and the natural dangers of the desert -- makers and thirst and dust chasms.
    She thought of calling for coffee and with the thought came that ever-present awareness of paradox in the Fremen way of life: how well they lived in these sietch caverns compared to the graben pyons; yet, how much more they endured in the open hajr of the desert than anything the Harkonnen bondsmen endured.
    A dark hand inserted itself through the hangings beside her, deposited a cup upon the table and withdrew. From the cup arose the aroma of spiced coffee.
    An offering from the birth celebration, Jessica thought.
    She took the coffee and sipped it, smiling at herself. In what other society of our universe, she asked herself, could a person of my station accept an anonymous drink and quaff that drink without fear? I could alter any poison now before it did me harm, or course, but the donor doesn't realize this.
    She drained the cup, feeling the energy and lift of its contents -- hot and delicious.
    And she wondered what other society would have such a natural regard for her privacy and comfort that the giver would intrude only enough to deposit the gift and not inflict her with the donor? Respect and love had sent the gift -- with only a slight tinge of fear.
    Another element of the incident forced itself into her awareness: she had thought of coffee and it had appeared. There was nothing of telepathy here, she knew. It was the tau, the oneness of the sietch community, a compensation from the subtle poison of the spice diet they shared. The great mass of the people could never hope to attain the enlightenment the spice seed brought to her; they had not been trained and prepared for it. Their minds rejected what they could not understand or encompass. Still they felt and reacted sometimes like a single organism.
    And the thought of coincidence never entered their minds.
    Has Paul passed his test on the sand? Jessica asked herself. He's capable, but accident can strike down even the most capable. 
    The waiting.
    It's the dreariness, she thought. You can wait just so long. Then the dreariness of the waiting overcomes you. 
    There was all manner of waiting in their lives.
    More than two years we've been here, she thought, and twice that number at least to go before we can even hope to think of trying to wrest Arrakis from the Harkonnen governor, the Mudir Nahya, the Beast Rabban.
    "Reverend Mother?"
    The voice from outside the hangings at her door was that of Harah, the other woman in Paul's menage. 
    "Yes, Harah."
    The hangings parted and Harah seemed to glide through them. She wore sietch sandals, a red-yellow wraparound that exposed her arms almost to the shoulders. Her black hair was parted in the middle and swept back like the wings of an insect, flat and oily against her head. The jutting, predatory features were drawn into an intense frown.
    Behind Harah came Alia, a girl-child of about two years.
    Seeing her daughter, Jessica was caught as she frequently was by Alia's resemblance to Paul at that age -- the same wide-eyed solemnity to her questing look, the dark hair and firmness of mouth. But there were subtle differences, too, and it was in these that most adults found Alia disquieting. The child -- little more than a toddler -- carried herself with a calmness and awareness beyond her years. Adults were shocked to find her laughing at a subtle play of words between the sexes. Or they'd catch themselves listening to her half-lisping voice, still blurred as it was by an unformed soft palate, and discover in her words sly remarks that could only be based on experiences no two-year-old had ever encountered.
    Harah sank to a cushion with an exasperated sigh, frowned at the child.
    "Alia." Jessica motioned to her daughter.
    The child crossed to a cushion beside her mother, sank to it and clasped her mother's hand. The contact of flesh restored that mutual awareness they had shared since before Alia's birth. It wasn't a matter of shared thoughts -- although there were bursts of that if they touched while Jessica was changing the spice poison for a ceremony. It was something larger, an immediate awareness of another living spark, a sharp and poignant thing, a nerve-sympatico that made them emotionally one.
    In the formal manner that befitted a member of her son's household, Jessica said: "Subakh ul kuhar, Harah. This night finds you well?"
    With the same traditional formality, she said: "Subakh un nar. I am well." The words were almost toneless. Again, she sighed. 
    Jessica sensed amusement from Alia.
    "My brother's ghanima is annoyed with me," Alia said in her half-lisp.
    Jessica marked the term Alia used to refer to Harah -- ghanima. In the subtleties of the Fremen tongue, the word meant "something acquired in battle" and with the added overtone that the something no longer was used for its original purpose. An ornament, a spearhead used as a curtain weight.
    Harah scowled at the child. "Don't try to insult me, child. I know my place." 
    "What have you done this time, Alia?" Jessica asked.
    Harah answered; "Not only has she refused to play with the other children today, but she intruded where . . . "
    "I hid behind the hangings and watched Subiay's child being born," Alia said. "It's a boy. He cried and cried. What a set of lungs! When he'd cried long enough --"
    "She came out and touched him," Harah said, "and he stopped crying. Everyone knows a Fremen baby must get his crying done at birth, if he's in sietch because he can never cry again lest he betray us on hajr."
    "He'd cried enough," Alia said. "I just wanted to feel his spark, his life. That's all. And when he felt me he didn't want to cry anymore." 
    "It's just made more talk among the people," Harah said.
    "Subiay's boy is healthy?" Jessica asked. She saw that something was troubling Harah deeply and wondered at it.
    "Healthy as any mother could ask," Harah said. "They know Alia didn't hurt him. They didn't so much mind her touching him. He settled down right away and was happy. It was . . . " Harah shrugged.
    "It's the strangeness of my daughter, is that it?" Jessica asked. "It's the way she speaks of things beyond her years and of things no child her age could know -- things of the past."
    "How could she know what a child looked like on Bela Tegeuse?" Harah demanded.
    "But he does!" Alia said, "Subiay's boy looks just like the son of Mitha born before the parting." 
    "Alia!" Jessica said. "I warned you." 
    "But, Mother, I saw it and it was true and . . . " 
    Jessica shook her head, seeing the signs of disturbance in Harah's face. What have I borne? Jessica asked herself. A daughter who knew at birth everything that I knew . . . and more: everything revealed to her out of the corridors of the past by the Reverend Mothers within me.
    "It's not just the things she says," Harah said. "It's the exercises, too: the way she sits and stares at a rock, moving only one muscle beside her nose, or a muscle on the back of a finger, or --" 
    "Those are the Bene Gesserit training," Jessica said. "You know that, Harah. Would you deny my daughter her inheritance?" 
    "Reverend Mother, you know these things don't matter to me," Harah said. "It's the people and the way they mutter. I feel danger in it. They say your daughter's a demon, that other children refuse to play with her, that she's --"
    "She has so little in common with the other children," Jessica said. "She's no demon. It's just the --" 
    "Of course she's not!"
    Jessica found herself surprised at the vehemence in Harah's tone, glanced down at Alia. The child appeared lost in thought, radiating a sense of . . . waiting. Jessica returned her attention to Harah.
    "I respect the fact that you're a member of my son's household," Jessica said. (Alia stirred against her hand.) "You may speak openly with me of whatever's troubling you."
    "I will not be a member of your son's household much longer," Harah said. "I've waited this long for the sake of my sons, the special training they receive as the children of Usul. It's little enough I could give them since it's known I don't share your son's bed." 
    Again Alia stirred beside her, half-sleeping, warm.
    "You'd have made a good companion for my son, though," Jessica said. And she added to herself because such thoughts were ever with her: Companion . . . not a wife. Jessica's thoughts went then straight to the center, to the pang that came from the common talk in the sietch that her son's companionship with Chani had become a permanent thing, the marriage.
    I love Chani, Jessica thought, but she reminded herself that love might have to step aside for royal necessity. Royal marriages had other reasons than love.
    "You think I don't know what you plan for your son?" Harah asked.
    "What do you mean?" Jessica demanded. 
    "You plan to unite the tribes under Him," Harah said. 
    "Is that bad?" 
    "I see danger for him . . . and Alia is part of that danger." 
    Alia nestled closer to her mother, eyes opened now and studying Harah.
    "I've watched you two together," Harah said, "the way you touch. And Alia is like my own flesh because she's sister to one who is like my brother. I've watched over her and guarded her from the time she was a mere baby, from the time of the razzia when we fled here. I've seen many things about her." 
    Jessica nodded, feeling disquiet begin to grow in Alia beside her.
    "You know what I mean," Harah said. "The way she knew from the first what we were saying to her. When has there been another baby who knew the water discipline so young? What other baby's first words to her nurse were: 'I love you, Harah'?"
    Harah stared at Alia. "Why do you think I accept her insults? I know there's no malice in them." 
    Alia looked up at her mother.
    "Yes, I have reasoning powers, Reverend Mother," Harah said. "I could have been of the Sayyadina. I have seen what I have seen."
    "Harah . . . " Jessica shrugged. "I don't know what to say." And she felt surprise at herself, because this literally was true.
    Alia straightened, squared her shoulders. Jessica felt the sense of waiting ended, an emotion compounded of decision and sadness. 
    "We made a mistake," Alia said. "Now we need Harah." 
    "It was the ceremony of the seed," Harah said, "when you changed the Water of Life, Reverend Mother, when Alia was yet unborn within you." 
    Need Harah? Jessica asked herself.
    "Who else can talk among the people and make them begin to understand me?" Alia asked.
    "What would you have her do?" Jessica asked. 
    "She already knows what to do," Alia said.
    "I will tell them the truth," Harah said. Her face seemed suddenly old and sad with its olive skin drawn into frown wrinkles, a witchery in the sharp features. "I will tell them that Alia only pretends to be a little girl, that she has never been a little girl." 
    Alia shook her head. Tears ran down her cheeks, and Jessica felt the wave of sadness from her daughter as though the emotion were her own.
    "I know I'm a freak," Alia whispered. The adult summation coming from the child mouth was like a bitter confirmation.
    "You're not a freak!" Harah snapped. "Who dared say you're a freak?"
    Again, Jessica marveled at the fierce note of protectiveness in Harah's voice. Jessica saw then that Alia had judged correctly -- they did need Harah. The tribe would understand Harah -- both her words and her emotions -- for it was obvious she loved Alia as though this were her own child. 
    "Who said it?" Harah repeated. 
    "Nobody."
    Alia used a corner of Jessica's aba to wipe the tears from her face. She smoothed the robe where she had dampened and crumpled it.
    "Then don't you say it," Harah ordered. 
    "Yes, Harah."
    "Now," Harah said, "you may tell me what it was like so that I may tell the others. Tell me what it is that happened to you." 
    Alia swallowed, looked up at her mother. 
    Jessica nodded.
    "One day I woke up," Alia said. "It was like waking from sleep except that I could not remember going to sleep. I was in a warm, dark place. And I was frightened."
    Listening to the half-lisping voice of her daughter, Jessica remembered that day in the big cavern.
    "When I was frightened," Alia said, "I tried to escape, but there was no way to escape. Then I saw a spark . . . but it wasn't exactly like seeing it. The spark was just there with me and I felt the spark's emotions . . . soothing me, comforting me, telling me that way that everything would be all right. That was my mother."
    Harah rubbed at her eyes, smiled reassuringly at Alia. Yet there was a look of wildness in the eyes of the Fremen woman, an intensity as though they, too, were trying to hear Alia's words.
    And Jessica thought: What do we really know of how such a one thinks . . . out of her unique experiences and training and ancestry?
    "Just when I felt safe and reassured," Alia said, "there, was another spark with us . . . and everything was happening at once. The other spark was the old Reverend Mother. She was . . . trading lives with my mother . . . everything . . . and I was there with them, seeing it all . . . everything. And it was over, and I was them and all the others and myself . . . only it took me a long time to find myself again. There were so many others."
    "It was a cruel thing," Jessica said. "No being should wake into consciousness thus. The wonder of it is you could accept all that happened to you."
    "I couldn't do anything else!" Alia said. "I didn't know how to reject or hide my consciousness . . . or shut if off . . . everything just happened . . . everything . . . "
    "We didn't know," Harah murmured. "When we gave your mother the Water to change, we didn't know you existed within her."
    "Don't be sad about it, Harah," Alia said. "I shouldn't feel sorry for myself. After all, there's cause for happiness here: I'm a Reverend Mother. The tribe has two Rev . . . " 
    She broke off, tipping her head to listen.
    Harah rocked back on her heels against the sitting cushion, stared at Alia, bringing her attention then up to Jessica's face. 
    "Didn't you suspect?" Jessica asked. 
    "Sh-h-h-h," Alia said.
    A distant rhythmic chanting came to them through the hangings that separated them from the sietch corridors. It grew louder, carrying distinct sounds now: "Ya! Ya! Yawm! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, wallah! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, Wallah!" 
    The chanters passed the outer entrance, and their voices boomed through to the inner apartments. Slowly the sound receded.
    When the sound had dimmed sufficiently, Jessica began the ritual, the sadness in her voice: "It was Ramadhan and April on Bela Tegeuse."
    "My family sat in their pool courtyard," Harah said, "in air bathed by the moisture that arose from the spray of a fountain. There was a tree of portyguls, round and deep in color, near at hand. There was a basket with mish mish and baklawa and mugs of liban -- all manner of good things to eat. In our gardens and, in our flocks, there was peace . . . peace in all the land." 
    "Life was full with happiness until the raiders came," Alia said.
    "Blood ran cold at the scream of friends," Jessica said. And she felt the memories rushing through her out of all those other pasts she shared.
    "La, la, la, the women cried," said Harah.
    "The raiders came through the mushtamal, rushing at us with their knives dripping red from the lives of our men," Jessica said.
    Silence came over the three of them as it was in all the apartments of the sietch, the silence while they remembered and kept their grief thus fresh.
    Presently, Harah uttered the ritual ending to the ceremony, giving the words a harshness that Jessica had never before heard in them.
    "We will never forgive and we will never forget," Harah said.
    In the thoughtful quiet that followed her words, they heard a muttering of people, the swish of many robes. Jessica sensed someone standing beyond the hangings that shielded her chamber. 
    "Reverend Mother?"
    A woman's voice, and Jessica recognized it: the voice of Tharthar, one of Stilgar's wives. 
    "What is it, Tharthar?" 
    "There is trouble, Reverend Mother."
    Jessica felt a constriction at her heart, an abrupt fear for Paul. "Paul . . ." she gasped.
    Tharthar spread the hangings, stepped into the chamber. Jessica glimpsed a press of people in the outer room before the hangings fell. She looked up at Tharthar -- a small, dark woman in a red-figured robe of black, the total blue of her eyes trained fixedly on Jessica, the nostrils of her tiny nose dilated to reveal the plug scars. 
    "What is it?" Jessica demanded.
    "There is word from the sand," Tharthar said. "Usul meets the maker for his test . . . it is today. The young men say he cannot fail, he will be a sandrider by nightfall. The young men are banding for a razzia. They will raid in the north and meet Usul there. They say they will raise the cry then. They say they will force him to call out Stilgar and assume command of the tribes."
    Gathering water, planting the dunes, changing their world slowly but surely -- these are no longer enough, Jessica thought. The little raids, the certain raids -- these are no longer enough now that Paul and I have trained them. They feel their power. They want to fight.
    Tharthar shifted from one foot to the other, cleared her throat.
    We know the need for cautious waiting, Jessica thought, but there's the core of our frustration. We know also the harm that waiting extended too long can do us. We lose our senses of purpose if the waiting's prolonged.
    "The young men say if Usul does not call out Stilgar, then he must be afraid," Tharthar said. 
    She lowered her gaze. 
    "So that's the way of it," Jessica muttered. And she thought: Well I saw it coming. As did Stilgar.
    Again, Tharthar cleared her throat. "Even my brother, Shoab, says it," she said. "They will leave Usul no choice." 
    Then it has come, Jessica thought. And Paul will have to handle it himself. The Reverend Mother dare not become involved in the succession.
    Alia freed her hand from her mother's, said: "I will go with Tharthar and listen to the young men. Perhaps there is a way." 
    Jessica met Tharthar's gaze, but spoke to Alia: "Go, then. And report to me as soon as you can."
    "We do not want this thing to happen, Reverend Mother," Tharthar said.
    "We do not want it," Jessica agreed. "The tribe needs all its strength." She glanced at Harah. "Will you go with them?" 
    Harah answered the unspoken part of the question: "Tharthar will allow no harm to befall Alia. She knows we will soon be wives together, she and I, to share the same man. We have talked, Tharthar and I." Harah looked up at Tharthar, back to Jessica. "We have an understanding."
    Tharthar held out a hand for Alia, said: "We must hurry. The young men are leaving."
    They pressed through the hangings, the child's hand in the small woman's hand, but the child seemed to be leading.
    "If Paul-Muad'Dib slays Stilgar, this will not serve the tribe," Harah said. "Always before, it has been the way of succession, but times have changed." 
    "Times have changed for you, as well," Jessica said.
    "You cannot think I doubt the outcome of such a battle," Harah said. "Usul could not but win." 
    "That was my meaning," Jessica said.
    "And you think my personal feelings enter into my judgment," Harah said. She shook her head, her water rings tinkling at her neck. "How wrong you are. Perhaps you think, as well, that I regret not being the chosen of Usul, that I am jealous of Chani?" 
    "You make your own choice as you are able," Jessica said.
    "I pity Chani," Harah said.
    Jessica stiffened. "What do you mean?"
    "I know what you think of Chani," Harah said. "You think she is not the wife for your son."
    Jessica settled back, relaxed on her cushions. She shrugged. "Perhaps."
    "You could be right," Harah said. "If you are, you may find a surprising ally -- Chani herself. She wants whatever is best for Him."
    Jessica swallowed past a sudden tightening in her throat. "Chani's very dear to me," she said. "She could be no --"
    "Your rugs are very dirty in here," Harah said. She swept her gaze around the floor, avoiding Jessica's eyes. "So many people tramping through here all the time. You really should have them cleaned more often."

You cannot avoid the interplay of politics within an orthodox religion. This power struggle permeates the training, educating and disciplining of the orthodox community. Because of this pressure, the leaders of such a community inevitably must face that ultimate internal question: to succumb to complete opportunism as the price of maintaining their rule, or risk sacrificing themselves for the sake of the orthodox ethic.
-from "Muad'Dib: The Religious Issues" by the Princess Irulan

    Paul waited on the sand outside the gigantic maker's line of approach. I must not wait like a smuggler -- impatient and jittering, he reminded himself. I must be part of the desert.
    The thing was only minutes away now, filling the morning with the friction-hissing of its passage. Its great teeth within the cavern-circle of its mouth spread like some enormous flower. The spice odor from it dominated the air.
    Paul's stillsuit rode easily on his body and he was only distantly aware of his nose plugs, the breathing mask. Stilgar's teaching, the painstaking hours on the sand, overshadowed all else.
    "How far outside the maker's radius must you stand in pea sand?" Stilgar had asked him.
    And he had answered correctly: "Half a meter for every meter of the maker's diameter." 
    "Why?"
    "To avoid the vortex of its passage and still have time to run in and mount it."
    "You've ridden the little ones bred for the seed and the Water of Life," Stilgar had said. "But what you'll summon for your test is a wild maker, an old man of the desert. You must have proper respect for such a one."
    Now the thumper's deep drumming blended with the hiss of the approaching worm. Paul breathed deeply, smelling mineral bitterness of sand even through his filters. The wild maker, the old man of the desert, loomed, almost on him. Its cresting front segments threw a sandwave that would sweep across his knees.
    Come up, you lovely monster, he thought. Up. You hear me calling. Come up. Come up.
    The wave lifted his feet. Surface dust swept across him. He steadied himself, his world dominated by the passage of that sand-clouded curving wall, that segmented cliff, the ring lines sharply defined in it.
    Paul lifted his hooks, sighted along them, leaned in. He felt them bite and pull. He leaped upward, planting his feet against that wall, leaning out against the clinging barbs. This was the true instant of the testing: if he had planted the hooks correctly at the leading edge of a ring segment, opening the segment, the worm would not roll down and crush him.
    The worm slowed. It glided across the thumper, silencing it. Slowly, it began to roll -- up, up -- bringing those irritant barbs as high as possible, away from the sand that threatened the soft inner lapping of its ring segment.
    Paul found himself riding upright atop the worm. He felt exultant, like an emperor surveying his world. He suppressed a sudden urge to cavort there, to turn the worm, to show off his mastery of this creature.
    Suddenly he understood why Stilgar had warned him once about brash young men who danced and played with these monsters, doing handstands on their backs, removing both hooks and replanting them before the worm could spill them.
    Leaving one hook in place, Paul released the other and planted it lower down the side. When the second hook was firm and tested, he brought down the first one, thus worked his way down the side. The maker rolled, and as it rolled, it turned, coming around the sweep of flour sand where the others waited.
    Paul saw them come up, using their hooks to climb, but avoiding the sensitive ring edges until they were on top. They rode at last in a triple line behind him, steadied against their hooks.
    Stilgar moved up through the ranks, checked the positioning of Paul's hooks, glanced up at Paul's smiling face.
    "You did it, eh?" Stilgar asked, raising his voice above the hiss of their passage. "That's what you think? You did it?" He straightened. "Now I tell you that was a very sloppy job. We have twelve-year-olds who do better. There was drumsand to your left where you waited. You could not retreat there if the worm turned that way." 
    The smile slipped from Paul's face. "I saw the drumsand." 
    "Then why did you not signal for one of us to take up position secondary to you? It was a thing you could do even in the test." 
    Paul swallowed, faced into the wind of their passage.
    "You think it bad of me to say this now," Stilgar said. "It is my duty. I think of your worth to the troop. If you had stumbled into that drumsand, the maker would've turned toward you." 
    In spite of a surge of anger, Paul knew that Stilgar spoke the truth. It took a long minute and the full effort of the training he had received from his mother for Paul to recapture a feeling of calm. "I apologize," he said. "It will not happen again." 
    "In a tight position, always leave yourself a secondary, someone to take the maker if you cannot," Stilgar said. "Remember that we work together. That way, we're certain. We work together, eh?" 
    He slapped Paul's shoulder. 
    "We work together," Paul agreed.
    "Now," Stilgar said, and his voice was harsh, "show me you know how to handle a maker. Which side are we on?" 
    Paul glanced down at the scaled ring surface on which they stood, noted the character and size of the scales, the way they grew larger off to his right, smaller to his left. Every worm, he knew, moved characteristically with one side up more frequently. As it grew older, the characteristic up-side became an almost constant thing. Bottom scales grew larger, heavier, smoother. Top scales could be told by size alone on a big worm.
    Shifting his hooks, Paul moved to the left. He motioned flankers down to open segments along the side and keep the worm on a straight course as it rolled. When he had it turned, he motioned two steersmen out of the line and into positions ahead.
    "Ach, haiiiii-yoh!" he shouted in the traditional call. The left-side steersman opened a ring segment there.
    In a majestic circle, the maker turned to protect its opened segment. Full around it came and when it was headed back to the south, Paul shouted: "Geyrat!"
    The steersman released his hook. The maker lined out in a straight course.
    Stilgar said. "Very good, Paul Muad'Dib. With plenty of practice, you may yet become a sandrider." 
    Paul frowned, thinking: Was I not first up?
    From behind him there came sudden laughter. The troop began chanting, flinging his name against the sky. 
    "Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!" 
    And far to the rear along the worm's surface, Paul heard the beat of the goaders pounding the tail segments. The worm began picking up speed. Their robes flapped in the wind. The abrasive sound of their passage increased.
    Paul looked back through the troop, found Chani's face among them. He looked at her as he spoke to Stilgar. "Then I am a sandrider, Stil?" 
    "Hal yawm! You are a sandrider this day." 
    "Then I may choose our destination?" 
    "That's the way of it."
    "And I am a Fremen born this day here in the Habbanya erg. I have had no life before this day. I was as a child until this day." 
    "Not quite a child," Stilgar said. He fastened a corner of his hood where the wind was whipping it.
    "But there was a cork sealing off my world, and that cork has been pulled." 
    "There is no cork."
    "I would go south, Stilgar -- twenty thumpers. I would see this land we make, this land that I've only seen through the eyes of others."
    And I would see my son and my family, he thought. I need time now to consider the future that is a past within my mind. The turmoil comes and if I'm not where I can unravel it, the thing will run wild.
    Stilgar looked at him with a steady, measuring gaze. Paul kept his attention on Chani, seeing the interest quicken in her face, noting also the excitement his words had kindled in the troop.
    "The men are eager to raid with you in the Harkonnen sinks," Stilgar said. "The sinks are only a thumper away." 
    "The Fedaykin have raided with me," Paul said. "They'll raid with me again until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air." 
    Stilgar studied him as they rode, and Paul realized the man was seeing this moment through the memory of how he had risen to command of the Tabr sietch and to leadership of the Council of Leaders now that Liet-Kynes was dead.
    He has heard the reports of unrest among the young Fremen, Paul thought.
    "Do you wish a gathering of the leaders?" Stilgar asked.
    Eyes blazed among the young men of the troop. They swayed as they rode, and they watched. And Paul saw the look of unrest in Chani's glance, the way she looked from Stilgar, who was her uncle, to Paul-Muad'Dib, who was her mate. 
    "You cannot guess what I want," Paul said.
    And he thought: I cannot back down. I must hold control over these people.
    "You are mudir of the sandride this day," Stilgar said. Cold formality rang in his voice: "How do you use this power?" 
    We need time to relax, time for cool reflection, Paul thought. 
    "We shall go south," Paul said.
    "Even if I say we shall turn back to the north when this day is over?" 
    "We shall go south," Paul repeated.
    A sense of inevitable dignity enfolded Stilgar as he pulled his robe tightly around him. "There will be a Gathering," he said. "I will send the messages."
    He thinks I will call him out, Paul thought. And he knows he cannot stand against me.
    Paul faced south, feeling the wind against his exposed cheeks, thinking of the necessities that went into his decisions. 
    They do not know how it is, he thought.
    But he knew he could not let any consideration deflect him. He had to remain on the central line of the time storm he could see in the future. There would come an instant when it could be unraveled, but only if he were where he could cut the central knot of it.
    I will not call him out if it can be helped, he thought. If there's another way to prevent the jihad . . . 
    "We'll camp for the evening meal and prayer at Cave of Birds beneath Habbanya Ridge," Stilgar said. He steadied himself with one hook against the swaying of the maker, gestured ahead at a low rock barrier rising out of the desert.
    Paul studied the cliff, the great streaks of rock crossing it like waves. No green, no blossom softened that rigid horizon. Beyond it stretched the way to the southern desert -- a course of at least ten days and nights, as fast as they could goad the makers. 
    Twenty thumpers.
    The way led far beyond the Harkonnen patrols. He knew how it would be. The dreams had shown him. One day, as they went, there 'd be a faint change of color on the far horizon -- such a slight change that he might feel he was imagining it out of his hopes -- and there would be the new sietch.
    "Does my decision suit Muad'Dib?" Stilgar asked. Only the faintest touch of sarcasm tinged his voice, but Fremen ears around them, alert to every tone in a bird's cry or a cielago's piping message, heard the sarcasm and watched Paul to see what he would do.
    "Stilgar heard me swear my loyalty to him when we consecrated the Fedaykin," Paul said. "My death commandos know I spoke with honor. Does Stilgar doubt it?"
    Real pain exposed itself in Paul's voice. Stilgar heard it and lowered his gaze.
    "Usul, the companion of my sietch, him I would never doubt," Stilgar said. "But you are Paul-Muad'Dib, the Atreides Duke, and you are the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. These men I don't even know."
    Paul turned away to watch the Habbanya Ridge climb out of the desert. The maker beneath them still felt strong and willing. It could carry them almost twice the distance of any other in Fremen experience. He knew it. There was nothing outside the stories told to children that could match this old man of the desert. It was the stuff of a new legend, Paul realized. 
    A hand gripped his shoulder.
    Paul looked at it, followed the arm to the face beyond it -- the dark eyes of Stilgar exposed between filter mask and stillsuit hood.
    "The one who led Tabr sietch before me," Stilgar said, "he was my friend. We shared dangers. He owed me his life many a time . . . and I owed him mine." 
    "I am your friend, Stilgar," Paul said.
    "No man doubts it," Stilgar said. He removed his hand, shrugged. "It's the way."
    Paul saw that Stilgar was too immersed in the Fremen way to consider the possibility of any other. Here a leader took the reins from the dead hands of his predecessor, or slew among the strongest of his tribe if a leader died in the desert. Stilgar had risen to be a naib in that way.
    "We should leave this maker in deep sand," Paul said. 
    "Yes," Stilgar agreed. "We could walk to the cave from here." 
    "We've ridden him far enough that he'll bury himself and sulk for a day or so," Paul said.
    "You're the mudir of the sandride," Stilgar said. "Say when we . . ." He broke off, stared at the eastern sky.
    Paul whirled. The spice-blue overcast on his eyes made the sky appear dark, a richly filtered azure against which a distant rhythmic flashing stood out in sharp contrast. 
    Ornithopter!
    "One small 'thopter," Stilgar said.
    "Could be a scout," Paul said. "Do you think they've seen us." 
    "At this distance we're just a worm on the surface," Stilgar said. He motioned with his left hand. "Off. Scatter on the sand." 
    The troop began working down the worm's sides, dropping off, blending with the sand beneath their cloaks. Paul marked where Chani dropped. Presently, only he and Stilgar remained.
    "First up, last off," Paul said.
    Stilgar nodded, dropped down the side on his hooks, leaped onto the sand. Paul waited until the maker was safely clear of the scatter area, then released his hooks. This was the tricky moment with a worm not completely exhausted.
    Freed of its goads and hooks, the big worm began burrowing into the sand. Paul ran lightly back along its broad surface, judged his moment carefully and leaped off. He landed running, lunged against the slipface of a dune the way he had been taught, and hid himself beneath the cascade of sand over his robe. 
    Now, the waiting . . . 
    Paul turned, gently, exposed a crack of sky beneath a crease in his robe. He imagined the others back along their path doing the same.
    He heard the beat of the 'thopter's wings before he saw it. There was a whisper of jetpods and it came over his patch of desert, turned in a broad arc toward the ridge. 
    An unmarked 'thopter, Paul noted. 
    It flew out of sight beyond Habbanya Ridge. 
    A bird cry sounded over the desert. Another.
    Paul shook himself free of sand, climbed to the dune top. Other figures stood out in a line trailing away from the ridge. He recognized Chani and Stilgar among them. 
    Stilgar signaled toward the ridge.
    They gathered and began the sandwalk, gliding over the surface in a broken rhythm that would disturb no maker. Stilgar paced himself beside Paul along the windpacked crest of a dune. 
    "It was a smuggler craft," Stilgar said.
    "So it seemed," Paul said. "But this is deep into the desert, for smugglers." 
    "They've their difficulties with patrols, too," Stilgar said. 
    "If they come this deep, they may go deeper," Paul said. 
    "True."
    "It wouldn't be well for them to see what they could see if they ventured too deep into the south. Smugglers sell information, too." 
    "They were hunting spice, don't you think?" Stilgar asked.
    "There will be a wing and a crawler waiting somewhere for that one," Paul said. "We've spice. Let's bait a patch of sand and catch us some smugglers. They should be taught that this is our land and our men need practice with the new weapons." 
    "Now, Usul speaks," Stilgar said. "Usul thinks Fremen." 
    But Usul must give way to decisions that match a terrible purpose, Paul thought.
    And the storm was gathering.

When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.
-from "Muad'Dib: The Ninety-Nine Wonders of the Universe" by Princess Irulan

    The smuggler's spice factory with its parent carrier and ring of drone ornithopters came over a lifting of dunes like a swarm of insects following its queen. Ahead of the swarm lay one of the low rock ridges that lifted from the desert floor like small imitations of the Shield Wall. The dry beaches of the ridge were swept clean by a recent storm.
    In the con-bubble of the factory, Gurney Halleck leaned forward, adjusted the oil lenses of his binoculars and examined the landscape. Beyond the ridge, he could see a dark patch that might be a spiceblow, and he gave the signal to a hovering ornithopter that sent it to investigate.
    The 'thopter waggled its wings to indicate it had the signal. It broke away from the swarm, sped down toward the darkened sand, circled the area with its detectors dangling close to the surface.
    Almost immediately, it went through the wing-tucked dip and circle that told the waiting factory that spice had been found.
    Gurney sheathed his binoculars, knowing the others had seen the signal. He liked this spot. The ridge offered some shielding and protection. This was deep in the desert, an unlikely place for an ambush . . . still . . . Gurney signaled for a crew to hover over the ridge, to scan it, sent reserves to take up station in pattern around the area -- not too high because then they could be seen from afar by Harkonnen detectors.
    He doubted, though, that Harkonnen patrols would be this far south. This was still Fremen country.
    Gurney checked his weapons, damning the fate that made shields useless out here. Anything that summoned a worm had to be avoided at all costs. He rubbed the inkvine scar along his jaw, studying the scene, decided it would be safest to lead a ground party through the ridge. Inspection on foot was still the most certain. You couldn't be too careful when Fremen and Harkonnen were at each other's throats.
    It was Fremen that worried him here. They didn't mind trading for all the spice you could afford, but they were devils on the warpath if you stepped foot where they forbade you to go. And they were so devilishly cunning of late.
    It annoyed Gurney, the cunning and adroitness in battle of these natives. They displayed a sophistication in warfare as good as anything he had ever encountered, and he had been trained by the best fighters in the universe then seasoned in battles where only the superior few survived.
    Again Gurney scanned the landscape, wondering why he felt uneasy. Perhaps it was the worm they had seen . . . but that was on the other side of the ridge.
    A head popped up into the con-bubble beside Gurney -- the factory commander, a one-eyed old pirate with full beard, the blue eyes and milky teeth of a spice diet.
    "Looks like a rich patch, sir," the factory commander said. "Shall I take 'er in?"
    "Come down at the edge of that ridge," Gurney ordered. "Let me disembark with my men. You can tractor out to the spice from there. We'll have a look at that rock." 
    "Aye."
    "In case of trouble," Gurney said, "save the factory. We'll lift in the 'thopters."
    The factory commander saluted. "Aye, sir." He popped back down through the hatch.
    Again Gurney scanned the horizon. He had to respect the possibility that there were Fremen here and he was trespassing. Fremen worried him, their toughness and unpredictability. Many things about this business worried him, but the rewards were great. The fact that he couldn't send spotters high overhead worried him, too. The necessity of radio silence added to his uneasiness.
    The factory crawler turned, began to descend. Gently it glided down to the dry beach at the foot of the ridge. Treads touched sand.
    Gurney opened the bubble dome, released his safety straps. The instant the factory stopped, he was out, slamming the bubble closed behind him, scrambling out over the tread guards to swing down to the sand beyond the emergency netting. The five men of his personal guard were out with him, emerging from the nose hatch. Others released the factory's carrier wing. It detached, lifted away to fly in a parking circle low overhead.
    Immediately the big factory crawler lurched off, swinging away from the ridge toward the dark patch of spice out on the sand.
    A 'thopter swooped down nearby, skidded to a stop. Another followed and another. They disgorged Gurney's platoon and lifted to hoverflight.
    Gurney tested his muscles in his stillsuit, stretching. He left the filter mask off his face, losing moisture for the sake of a greater need -- the carrying power of his voice if he had to shout commands. He began climbing up into the rocks, checking the terrain -- pebbles and pea sand underfoot, the smell of spice.
    Good site for an emergency base, he thought. Might be sensible to bury a few supplies here.
    He glanced back, watching his men spread out as they followed him. Good men, even the new ones he hadn't had time to test. Good men. Didn't have to be told every time what to do. Not a shield glimmer showed on any of them. No cowards in this bunch, carrying shields into the desert where a worm could sense the field and come to rob them of the spice they found.
    From this slight elevation in the rocks, Gurney could see the spice patch about half a kilometer away and the crawler just reaching the near edge. He glanced up at the coverflight, noting the altitude -- not too high. He nodded to himself, turned to resume his climb up the ridge.
    In that instant, the ridge erupted.
    Twelve roaring paths of flame streaked upward to the hovering 'thopters and carrier wing. There came a blasting of metal from the factory crawler, and the rocks around Gurney were full of hooded fighting men.
    Gurney had time to think: By the horns of the Great Mother! Rockets! They dare to use rockets!
    Then he was face to face with a hooded figure who crouched low, crysknife at the ready. Two more men stood waiting on the rocks above to left and right. Only the eyes of the fighting man ahead of him were visible to Gurney between hood and veil of a sand-colored burnoose, but the crouch and readiness warned him that here was a trained fighting man. The eyes were the blue-in-blue of the deep-desert Fremen.
    Gurney moved one hand toward his own knife, kept his eyes fixed on the other's knife. If they dared use rockets, they'd have other projectile weapons. This moment argued extreme caution. He could tell by sound alone that at least part of his skycover had been knocked out. There were gruntings, too, the noise of several struggles behind him.
    The eyes of the fighting man ahead of Gurney followed the motion of hand toward knife, came back to glare into Gurney's eyes.
    "Leave the knife in its sheath, Gurney Halleck," the man said.
    Gurney hesitated. That voice sounded oddly familiar even through a stillsuit filter.
    "You know my name?" he said.
    "You've no need of a knife with me, Gurney," the man said. He straightened, slipped his crysknife into its sheath back beneath his robe. "Tell your men to stop their useless resistance." 
    The man threw his hood back, swung the filter aside.
    The shock of what he saw froze Gurney's muscles. He thought at first he was looking at a ghost image of Duke Leto Atreides. Full recognition came slowly.
    "Paul," he whispered. Then louder: "Is it truly Paul?" 
    "Don't you trust your own eyes?" Paul asked.
    "They said you were dead," Gurney rasped. He took a half-step forward.
    "Tell your men to submit," Paul commanded. He waved toward the lower reaches of the ridge.
    Gurney turned, reluctant to take his eyes off Paul. He saw only a few knots of struggle. Hooded desert men seemed to be everywhere around. The factory crawler lay silent with Fremen standing atop it. There were no aircraft overhead.
    "Stop the fighting," Gurney bellowed. He took a deep breath, cupped his hands for a megaphone. "This is Gurney Halleck! Stop the fight!"
    Slowly, warily, the struggling figures separated. Eyes turned toward him, questioning.
    "These are friends," Gurney called.
    "Fine friends!" someone shouted back. "Half our people murdered."
    "It's a mistake," Gurney said. "Don't add to it." 
    He turned back to Paul, stared into the youth's blue-blue Fremen eyes.
    A smile touched Paul's mouth, but there was a hardness in the expression that reminded Gurney of the Old Duke, Paul's grandfather. Gurney saw then the sinewy harshness in Paul that had never before been seen in an Atreides -- a leathery look to the skin, a squint to the eyes and calculation in the glance that seemed to weigh everything in sight.
    "They said you were dead," Gurney repeated.
    "And it seemed the best protection to let them think so," Paul said.
    Gurney realized that was all the apology he'd ever get for having been abandoned to his own resources, left to believe his young Duke . . . his friend, was dead. He wondered then if there were anything left here of the boy he had known and trained in the ways of fighting men.
    Paul took a step closer to Gurney, found that his eyes were smarting. "Gurney . . . "
    It seemed to happen of itself, and they were embracing, pounding each other on the back, feeling the reassurance of solid flesh. 
    "You young pup! You young pup!" Gurney kept saying. 
    And Paul: "Gurney, man! Gurney, man!"
    Presently, they stepped apart, looked at each other. Gurney took a deep breath. "So you're why the Fremen have grown so wise in battle tactics. I might've known. They keep doing things I could've planned myself. If I'd only known . . . " He shook his head. "If you'd only got word to me, lad. Nothing would've stopped me. I'd have come arunning and . . . " 
    A look in Paul's eyes stopped him . . . the hard, weighing stare.
    Gurney sighed. "Sure, and there'd have been those who wondered why Gurney Halleck went arunning, and some would've done more than question. They'd have gone hunting for answers." 
    Paul nodded, glanced to the waiting Fremen around them -- the looks of curious appraisal on the faces of the Fedaykin. He turned from the death commandos back to Gurney. Finding his former swordmaster filled him with elation. He saw it as a good omen, a sign that he was on the course of the future where all was well. 
    With Gurney at my side . . .
    Paul glanced down the ridge past the Fedaykin, studied the smuggler crew who had come with Halleck.
    "How do your men stand, Gurney?" he asked.
    "They're smugglers all," Gurney said. "They stand where the profit is."
    "Little enough profit in our venture," Paul said, and he noted the subtle finger signal flashed to him by Gurney's right hand -- the old hand code out of their past. There were men to fear and distrust in the smuggler crew.
    Paul pulled at his lip to indicate he understood, looked up at the men standing guard above them on the rocks. He saw Stilgar there. Memory of the unsolved problem with Stilgar cooled some of Paul's elation.
    "Stilgar," he said, "this is Gurney Halleck of whom you've heard me speak. My father's master-of-arms, one of the swordmasters who instructed me, an old friend. He can be trusted in any venture." 
    "I hear," Stilgar said. "You are his Duke."
    Paul stared at the dark visage above him, wondering at the reasons which had impelled Stilgar to say just that. His Duke. There had been a strange subtle intonation in Stilgar's voice, as though he would rather have said something else. And that wasn't like Stilgar, who was a leader of Fremen, a man who spoke his mind.
    My Duke! Gurney thought. He looked anew at Paul. Yes, with Leto dead, the title fell on Paul's shoulders.
    The pattern of the Fremen war on Arrakis began to take on new shape in Gurney's mind. My Duke! A place that had been dead within him began coming alive. Only part of his awareness focused on Paul's ordering the smuggler crew disarmed until they could be questioned.
    Gurney's mind returned to the command when he heard some of his men protesting. He shook his head, whirled. "Are you men deaf?" he barked. "This is the rightful Duke of Arrakis. Do as he commands." 
    Grumbling, the smugglers submitted.
    Paul moved up beside Gurney, spoke in a low voice. "I'd not have expected you to walk into this trap, Gurney." 
    "I'm properly chastened," Gurney said. "I'll wager yon patch of spice is little more than a sand grain's thickness, a bait to lure us."
    "That's a wager you'd win," Paul said. He looked down at the men being disarmed. "Are there any more of my father's men among your crew?"
    "None. We're spread thin. There're a few among the free traders. Most have spent their profits to leave this place."
    "But you stayed." 
    "I stayed." 
    "Because Rabban is here," Paul said.
    "I thought I had nothing left but revenge," Gurney said.
    An oddly chopped cry sounded from the ridgetop. Gurney looked up to see a Fremen waving his kerchief.
    "A maker comes," Paul said. He moved out to a point of rock with Gurney following, looked off to the southwest. The burrow mound of a worm could be seen in the middle distance, a dust-crowned track that cut directly through the dunes on a course toward the ridge.
    "He's big enough," Paul said.
    A clattering sound lifted from the factory crawler below them. It turned on its treads like a giant insect, lumbered toward the rocks. 
    "Too bad we couldn't have saved the carryall," Paul said.
    Gurney glanced at him, looked back to the patches of smoke and debris out on the desert where carryall and ornithopters had been brought down by Fremen rockets. He felt a sudden pang for the men lost there -- his men, and he said: "Your father would've been more concerned for the men he couldn't save."
    Paul shot a hard stare at him, lowered his gaze. Presently, he said: "They were your friends, Gurney. I understand. To us, though, they were trespassers who might see things they shouldn't see. You must understand that."
    "I understand it well enough," Gurney said. "Now, I'm curious to see what I shouldn't."
    Paul looked up to see the old and well-remembered wolfish grin on Halleck's face, the ripple of the inkvine scar along the man's jaw.
    Gurney nodded toward the desert below them. Fremen were going about their business all over the landscape. It struck him that none of them appeared worried by the approach of the worm.
    A thumping sounded from the open dunes beyond the baited patch of spice -- a deep drumming that seemed to be heard through their feet. Gurney saw Fremen spread out across the sand there in the path of the worm.
    The worm came on like some great sandfish, cresting the surface, its rings rippling and twisting. In a moment, from his vantage point above the desert, Gurney saw the taking of a worm -- the daring leap of the first hookman, the turning of the creature, the way an entire band of men went up the scaly, glistening curve of the worm's side. 
    "There's one of the things you shouldn't have seen," Paul said. 
    "There's been stories and rumors," Gurney said. "But it's not a thing easy to believe without seeing it." He shook his head. "The creature all men on Arrakis fear, you treat it like a riding animal." 
    "You heard my father speak of desert power," Paul said. "There it is. The surface of this planet is ours. No storm nor creature nor condition can stop us."
    Us, Gurney thought. He means the Fremen. He speaks of himself as one of them. Again, Gurney looked at the spice blue in Paul's eyes. His own eyes, he knew, had a touch of the color, but smugglers could get offworld foods and there was a subtle caste implication in the tone of the eyes among them. They spoke of "the touch of the spicebrush" to mean a man had gone too native. And there was always a hint of distrust in the idea.
    "There was a time when we did not ride the maker in the light of day in these latitudes," Paul said. "But Rabban has little enough air cover left that he can waste it looking for a few specks in the sand." He looked at Gurney. "Your aircraft were a shock to us here." 
    To us . . . to us . . . 
    Gurney shook his head to drive out such thoughts. "We weren't the shock to you that you were to us," he said.
    "What's the talk of Rabban in the sinks and villages?" Paul asked.
    "They say they've fortified the graben villages to the point where you cannot harm them. They say they need only sit inside their defenses while you wear yourselves out in futile attack." 
    "In a word," Paul said, "they're immobilized." 
    "While you can go where you will," Gurney said.
    "It's a tactic I learned from you," Paul said. "They've lost the initiative, which means they've lost the war." 
    Gurney smiled, a slow, knowing expression.
    "Our enemy is exactly where I want him to be," Paul said. He glanced at Gurney. "Well, Gurney, do you enlist with me for the finish of this campaign?"
    "Enlist?" Gurney stared at him. "My Lord, I've never left your service. You're the only one left me . . . to think you dead. And I, being cast adrift, made what shrift I could, waiting for the moment I might sell my life for what it's worth -- the death of Rabban." 
    An embarrassed silence settled over Paul.
    A woman came climbing up the rocks toward them, her eyes between stillsuit hood and facemask flicking between Paul and his companion. She stopped in front of Paul. Gurney noted the possessive air about her, the way she stood close to Paul.
    "Chani," Paul said, "this is Gurney Halleck. You've heard me speak of him."
    She looked at Halleck, back to Paul. "I have heard." 
    "Where did the men go on the maker?" Paul asked. 
    "They but diverted it to give us time to save the equipment." 
    "Well then . . ." Paul broke off, sniffed the air. 
    "There's wind coming," Chani said.
    A voice called out from the ridgetop above them: "Ho, there -- the wind!"
    Gurney saw a quickening of motion among the Fremen now -- a rushing about and sense of hurry. A thing the worm had not ignited was brought about by fear of the wind. The factory crawler lumbered up onto the dry beach below them and a way was opened for it among the rocks . . . and the rocks closed behind it so neatly that the passage escaped his eyes.
    "Have you many such hiding places?" Gurney asked.
    "Many times many," Paul said. He looked at Chani. "Find Korba. Tell him that Gurney has warned me there are men among this smuggler crew who're not to be trusted."
    She looked once at Gurney, back to Paul, nodded, and was off down the rocks, leaping with a gazelle-like agility. 
    "She is your woman," Gurney said.
    "The mother of my firstborn," Paul said. "There's another Leto among the Atreides." 
    Gurney accepted this with only a widening of the eyes.
    Paul watched the action around them with a critical eye. A curry color dominated the southern sky now and there came fitful bursts and gusts of wind that whipped dust around their heads.
    "Seal your suit," Paul said. And he fastened the mask and hood about his face.
    Gurney obeyed, thankful for the filters.
    Paul spoke, his voice muffled by the filter: "Which of your crew don't you trust, Gurney?"
    "There're some new recruits," Gurney said. "Offworlders . . . " He hesitated, wondering at himself suddenly. Offworlders. The word had come so easily to his tongue. 
    "Yes?" Paul said.
    "They're not like the usual fortune-hunting lot we get," Gurney said. "They're tougher." 
    "Harkonnen spies?" Paul asked.
    "I think m'Lord, that they report to no Harkonnen. I suspect they're men of the Imperial service. They have a hint of Salusa Secundus about them." 
    Paul shot a sharp glance at him. "Sardaukar?" 
    Gurney shrugged. "They could be, but it's well masked."
    Paul nodded, thinking how easily Gurney had fallen back into the pattern of Atreides retainer . . . but with subtle reservations . . . differences. Arrakis had changed him, too.
    Two hooded Fremen emerged from the broken rock below them, began climbing upward. One of them carried a large black bundle over one shoulder.
    "Where are my crew now?" Gurney asked.
    "Secure in the rocks below us," Paul said. "We've a cave here -- Cave of Birds. We'll decide what to do with them after the storm." 
    A voice called from above them: "Muad'Dib!" 
    Paul turned at the call, saw a Fremen guard motioning them down to the cave. Paul signaled he had heard.
    Gurney studying him with a new expression. "You're Muad'Dib?" he asked. "You're the will-o'-the-sand?" 
    "It's my Fremen name," Paul said.
    Gurney turned away, feeling an oppressive sense of foreboding. Half his own crew dead on the sand, the others captive. He did not care about the new recruits, the suspicious ones, but among the others were good men, friends, people for whom he felt responsible. "We'll decide what to do with them after the storm." That's what Paul had said, Muad'Dib had said. And Gurney recalled the stories told of Muad'Dib, the Lisan al-Gaib -- how he had taken the skin of a Harkonnen officer to make his drumheads, how he was surrounded by death commandos, Fedaykin who leaped into battle with their death chants on their lips. 
    Him.
    The two Fremen climbing up the rocks leaped lightly to a shelf in front of Paul. The dark-faced one said: "All secure, Muad'Dib. We best get below now." 
    "Right."
    Gurney noted the tone of the man's voice -- half command and half request. This was the man called Stilgar, another figure of the new Fremen legends.
    Paul looked at the bundle the other man carried, said: "Korba, what's in the bundle?"
    Stilgar answered: " 'Twas in the crawler. It had the initial of your friend here and it contains a baliset. Many times have I heard you speak of the prowess of Gurney Halleck on the baliset." 
    Gurney studied the speaker, seeing the edge of black beard above the stillsuit mask, the hawk stare, the chiseled nose.
    "You've a companion who thinks, m'Lord," Gurney said. "Thank you, Stilgar."
    Stilgar signaled for his companion to pass the bundle to Gurney, said: "Thank your Lord Duke. His countenance earns your admittance here."
    Gurney accepted the bundle, puzzled by the hard undertones in this conversation. There was an air of challenge about the man, and Gurney wondered if it could be a feeling of jealousy in the Fremen. Here was someone called Gurney Halleck who'd known Paul even in the times before Arrakis, a man who shared a camaraderie that Stilgar could never invade.
    "You are two I'd have be friends," Paul said.
    "Stilgar, the Fremen, is a name of renown," Gurney said. "Any killer of Harkonnens I'd feel honored to count among my friends."
    "Will you touch hands with my friend Gurney Halleck, Stilgar?" Paul asked.
    Slowly, Stilgar extended his hand, gripped the heavy calluses of Gurney's swordhand. "There're few who haven't heard the name of Gurney Halleck," he said, and released his grip. He turned to Paul. "The storm comes rushing." 
    "At once," Paul said.
    Stilgar turned away, led them down through the rocks, a twisting and turning path into a shadowed cleft that admitted them to the low entrance of a cave. Men hurried to fasten a doorseal behind them. Glowglobes showed a broad, dome-ceilinged space with a raised ledge on one side and a passage leading off from it.
    Paul leaped to the ledge with Gurney right behind him, led the way into the passage. The others headed for another passage opposite the entrance. Paul led the way through an anteroom and into a chamber with dark, wine-colored hangings on its walls.
    "We can have some privacy here for a while," Paul said. "The others will respect my --"
    An alarm cymbal clanged from the outer chamber, was followed by shouting and clashing of weapons. Paul whirled, ran back through the anteroom and out onto the atrium lip above the outer chamber. Gurney was right behind, weapon drawn.
    Beneath them on the floor of the cave swirled a melee of struggling figures. Paul stood an instant assessing the scene, separating the Fremen robes and bourkas from the costumes of those they opposed. Senses that his mother had trained to detect the most subtle clues picked out a significant fact -- the Fremen fought against men wearing smuggler robes, but the smugglers were crouched in trios, backed into triangles where pressed.
    That habit of close fighting was a trademark of the Imperial Sardaukar.
    A Fedaykin in the crowd saw Paul, and his battlecry was lifted to echo in the chamber: "Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!" 
    Another eye had also picked Paul out. A black knife came hurtling toward him. Paul dodged, heard the knife clatter against stone behind him, glanced to see Gurney retrieve it. 
    The triangular knots were being pressed back now. 
    Gurney held the knife up in front of Paul's eyes, pointed to the hairline yellow coil of Imperial color, the golden lion crest, multifaceted eyes at the pommel. 
    Sardaukar for certain.
    Paul stepped out to the lip of the ledge. Only three of the Sardaukar remained. Bloody rag mounds of Sardaukar and Fremen lay in a twisted pattern across the chamber.
    "Hold!" Paul shouted. "The Duke Paul Atreides commands you to hold!" 
    The fighting wavered, hesitated.
    "You Sardaukar!" Paul called to the remaining group. "By whose orders do you threaten a ruling Duke?" And, quickly, as his men started to press in around the Sardaukar: "Hold, I say!" 
    One of the cornered trio straightened. "Who says we're Sardaukar?" he demanded.
    Paul took the knife from Gurney, held it aloft. "This says you're Sardaukar." 
    "Then who says you're a ruling Duke?" the man demanded.
    Paul gestured to the Fedaykin. "These men say I'm a ruling Duke. Your own emperor bestowed Arrakis on House Atreides. I am House Atreides." 
    The Sardaukar stood silent, fidgeting.
    Paul studied the man -- tall, flat-featured, with a pale scar across half his left cheek. Anger and confusion were betrayed in his manner, but still there was that pride about him without which a Sardaukar appeared undressed -- and with which he could appear fully clothed though naked.
    Paul glanced to one of his Fedaykin lieutenants, said: "Korba, how came they to have weapons?"
    "They held back knives concealed in cunning pockets within their stillsuits," the lieutenant said.
    Paul surveyed the dead and wounded across the chamber, brought his attention back to the lieutenant. There was no need for words. The lieutenant lowered his eyes.
    "Where is Chani?" Paul asked and waited, breath held, for the answer.
    "Stilgar spirited her aside." He nodded toward the other passage, glanced at the dead and wounded. "I hold myself responsible for this mistake, Muad'Dib."
    "How many of these Sardaukar were there, Gurney?" Paul asked.
    "Ten."
    Paul leaped lightly to the floor of the chamber, strode across to stand within striking distance of the Sardaukar spokesman.
    A tense air came over the Fedaykin. They did not like him thus exposed to danger. This was the thing they were pledged to prevent because the Fremen wished to preserve the wisdom of Muad'Dib.
    Without turning, Paul spoke to his lieutenant: "How many are our casualties?" 
    "Four wounded, two dead, Muad'Dib."
    Paul saw motion beyond the Sardaukar, Chani and Stilgar were standing in the other passage. He returned his attention to the Sardaukar, staring into the offworld whites of the spokesman's eyes. "You, what is your name?" Paul demanded. 
    The man stiffened, glanced left and right.
    "Don't try it," Paul said. "It's obvious to me that you were ordered to seek out and destroy Muad'Dib. I'll warrant you were the ones suggested seeking spice in the deep desert." 
    A gasp from Gurney behind him brought a thin smile to Paul's lips.
    Blood suffused the Sardaukar's face.
    "What you see before you is more than Muad'Dib," Paul said. "Seven of you are dead for two of us. Three for one. Pretty good against Sardaukar, eh?"
    The man came up on his toes, sank back as the Fedaykin pressed forward.
    "I asked your name," Paul said, and he called up the subtleties of Voice: "Tell me your name!"
    "Captain Aramsham, Imperial Sardaukar!" the man snapped. His jaw dropped. He stared at Paul in confusion. The manner about him that had dismissed this cavern as a barbarian warren melted away.
    "Well, Captain Aramsham," Paul said, "the Harkonnens would pay dearly to learn what you now know. And the Emperor -- what he wouldn't give to learn an Atreides still lives despite his treachery." 
    The captain glanced left and right at the two men remaining to him. Paul could almost see the thoughts turning over in the man's head. Sardaukar did not submit, but the Emperor had to learn of this threat.
    Still using the Voice, Paul said: "Submit, Captain."
    The man at the captain's left leaped without warning toward Paul, met the flashing impact of his own captain's knife in his chest. The attacker hit the floor in a sodden heap with the knife still in him.
    The captain faced his sole remaining companion. "I decide what best serves His Majesty," he said. "Understood?" 
    The other Sardaukar's shoulders slumped. 
    "Drop your weapon," the captain said. 
    The Sardaukar obeyed.
    The captain returned his attention to Paul. "I have killed a friend for you," he said. "Let us always remember that." 
    "You're my prisoners," Paul said. "You submitted to me. Whether you live or die is of no importance." He motioned to his guard to take the two Sardaukar, signaled the lieutenant who had searched the prisoners.
    The guard moved in, hustled the Sardaukar away. 
    Paul bent toward his lieutenant.
    "Muad'Dib," the man said. "I failed you in . . . " 
    "The failure was mine, Korba," Paul said. "I should've warned you what to seek. In the future, when searching Sardaukar, remember this. Remember, too, that each has a false toenail or two that can be combined with other items secreted about their bodies to make an effective transmitter. They'll have more than one false tooth. They carry coils of shigawire in their hair -- so fine you can barely detect it, yet strong enough to garrote a man and cut off his head in the process. With Sardaukar, you must scan them, scope them -- both reflex and hard ray -- cut off every scrap of body hair. And when you're through, be certain you haven't discovered everything." 
    He looked up at Gurney, who had moved close to listen. 
    "Then we best kill them," the lieutenant said.
    Paul shook his head, still looking at Gurney. "No. I want them to escape." Gurney stared at him. 
    "Sire . . . " he breathed. 
    "Yes?"
    "Your man here is right. Kill those prisoners at once. Destroy all evidence of them. You've shamed Imperial Sardaukar! When the Emperor learns that he'll not rest until he has you over a slow fire."
    "The Emperor's not likely to have that power over me," Paul said. He spoke slowly, coldly. Something had happened inside him while he faced the Sardaukar. A sum of decisions had accumulated in his awareness. "Gurney," he said, "are there many Guildsmen around Rabban?"
    Gurney straightened, eyes narrowed. "Your question makes no . . . " 
    "Are there?" Paul barked.
    "Arrakis is crawling with Guild agents. They're buying spice as though it were the most precious thing in the universe. Why else do you think we ventured this far into . . . "
    "It is the most precious thing in the universe," Paul said. "To them."
    He looked toward Stilgar and Chani who were now crossing the chamber toward him. "And we control it, Gurney." 
    "The Harkonnens control it!" Gurney protested.
    "The people who can destroy a thing, they control it," Paul said. He waved a hand to silence further remarks from Gurney, nodded to Stilgar who stopped in front of Paul, Chani beside him.
    Paul took the Sardaukar knife in his left hand, presented it to Stilgar. "You live for the good of the tribe," Paul said. "Could you draw my life's blood with that knife?" 
    "For the good of the tribe," Stilgar growled. 
    "Then use that knife," Paul said.
    "Are you calling me out?" Stilgar demanded.
    "If I do," Paul said, "I shall stand there without weapon and let you slay me." 
    Stilgar drew in a quick, sharp breath.
    Chani said, "Usul!" then glanced at Gurney, back to Paul.
    While Stilgar was still weighing his words, Paul said: "You are Stilgar, a fighting man. When the Sardaukar began fighting here, you were not in the front of battle. Your first thought was to protect Chani."
    "She's my niece," Stilgar said. "If there'd been any doubt of your Fedaykin handling those scum . . . " 
    "Why was your first thought of Chani?" Paul demanded. 
    "It wasn't!" 
    "Oh?" 
    "It was of you," Stilgar admitted.
    "Do you think you could lift your hand against me?" Paul asked. Stilgar began to tremble. "It's the way," he muttered.
    "It's the way to kill offworld strangers found in the desert and take their water as a gift from Shai-hulud," Paul said. "Yet you permitted two such to live one night, my mother and myself." 
    As Stilgar remained silent, trembling, staring at him, Paul said: "Ways change, Stil. You have changed them yourself." 
    Stilgar looked down at the yellow emblem on the knife he held. 
    "When I am Duke in Arrakeen with Chani by my side, do you think I'll have time to concern myself with every detail of governing Tabr sietch?" Paul asked. "Do you concern yourself with the internal problems of every family?" 
    Stilgar continued staring at the knife.
    "Do you think I wish to cut off my right arm?" Paul demanded. 
    Slowly, Stilgar looked up at him.
    "You!" Paul said. "Do you think I wish to deprive myself or the tribe of your wisdom and strength?"
    In a low voice, Stilgar said: "The young man of my tribe whose name is known to me, this young man I could kill on the challenge floor, Shai-hulud willing. The Lisan al-Gaib, him I could not harm. You knew this when you handed me this knife." 
    "I knew it," Paul agreed.
    Stilgar opened his hand. The knife clattered against the stone of the floor. "Ways change," he said.
    "Chani," Paul said, "go to my mother, send her here that her counsel will be available in --" 
    "But you said we would go to the south!" she protested.
    "I was wrong," he said. "The Harkonnens are not there. The war is not there."
    She took a deep breath, accepting this as a desert woman accepted all necessities in the midst of a life involved with death.
    "You will give my mother a message for her ears alone," Paul said. "Tell her that Stilgar acknowledges me Duke of Arrakis, but a way must be found to make the young men accept this without combat." 
    Chani glanced at Stilgar.
    "Do as he says," Stilgar growled. "We both know he could overcome me . . . and I could not raise my hand against him . . . for the good of the tribe." 
    "I shall return with your mother," Chani said.
    "Send her," Paul said. "Stilgar's instinct was right. I am stronger when you are safe. You will remain in the sietch." 
    She started to protest, swallowed it.
    "Sihaya," Paul said, using his intimate name for her. He whirled away to the right, met Gurney's glaring eyes.
    The interchange between Paul and the older Fremen had passed as though in a cloud around Gurney since Paul's reference to his mother.
    "Your mother," Gurney said.
    "Idaho saved us the night of the raid," Paul said, distracted by the parting with Chani. "Right now we've --" 
    "What of Duncan Idaho, m'Lord?" Gurney asked.
    "He's dead -- buying us a bit of time to escape." 
    The she-witch alive! Gurney thought. The one I swore vengeance against, alive! And it's obvious Duke Paul doesn't know what manner of creature gave him birth. The evil one! Betrayed his own father to the Harkonnens!
    Paul pressed past him, jumped up to the ledge. He glanced back, noted that the wounded and dead had been removed, and he thought bitterly that here was another chapter in the legend of Paul Muad'Dib. I didn't even draw my knife, but it'll be said of this day that I slew twenty Sardaukar by my own hand.
    Gurney followed with Stilgar, stepping on ground that he did not even feel. The cavern with its yellow light of glowglobes was forced out of his thoughts by rage. The she-witch alive while those she betrayed are bones in lonesome graves. I must contrive it that Paul learns the truth about her before I slay her.

-"The Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan

    The crowd in the cavern assembly chamber radiated that pack feeling Jessica had sensed the day Paul killed Jamis. There was murmuring nervousness in the voices. Little cliques gathered like knots among the robes.
    Jessica tucked a message cylinder beneath her robe as she emerged to the ledge from Paul's private quarters. She felt rested after the long journey up from the south, but still rankled that Paul would not yet permit them to use the captured ornithopters.
    "We do not have full control of the air," he had said. "And we must not become dependent upon offworld fuel. Both fuel and aircraft must be gathered and saved for the day of maximum effort."
    Paul stood with a group of the younger men near the ledge. The pale light of glowglobes gave the scene a tinge of unreality. It was like a tableau, but with the added dimension of warren smells, the whispers, the sounds of shuffling feet.
    She studied her son, wondering why he had not yet trotted out his surprise -- Gurney Halleck. Thought of Gurney disturbed her with its memories of an easier past -- days of love and beauty with Paul's father.
    Stilgar waited with a small group of his own at the other end of the ledge. There was a feeling of inevitable dignity about him, the way he stood without talking.
    We must not lose that man, Jessica thought. Paul's plan must work. Anything else would be highest tragedy.
    She strode down the ledge, passing Stilgar without a glance, stepped down into the crowd. A way was made for her as she headed toward Paul. And silence followed her.
    She knew the meaning of the silence -- the unspoken questions of the people, awe of the Reverend Mother.
    The young men drew back from Paul as she came up to him, and she found herself momentarily dismayed by the new deference they paid him. "All men beneath your position covet your station," went the Bene Gesserit axiom. But she found no covetousness in these faces. They were held at a distance by the religious ferment around Paul's leadership. And she recalled another Bene Gesserit saying: "Prophets have a way of dying by violence." 
    Paul looked at her.
    "It's time," she said, and passed the message cylinder to him.
    One of Paul's companions, bolder than the others, glanced across at Stilgar, said: "Are you going to call him out, Muad'Dib? Now's the time for sure. They'll think you a coward if you --" 
    "Who dares call me coward?" Paul demanded. His hand flashed to his crysknife hilt.
    Bated silence came over the group, spreading out into the crowd.
    "There's work to do," Paul said as the man drew back from him. Paul turned away, shouldered through the crowd to the ledge, leaped lightly up to it and faced the people. 
    "Do it!" someone shrieked.
    Murmurs and whispers arose behind the shriek.
    Paul waited for silence. It came slowly amidst scattered shufflings and coughs. When it was quiet in the cavern, Paul lifted his chin, spoke in a voice that carried to the farthest corners. 
    "You are tired of waiting," Paul said.
    Again, he waited while the cries of response died out.
    Indeed, they are tired of waiting, Paul thought. He hefted the message cylinder, thinking of what it contained. His mother had showed it to him, explaining how it had been taken from a Harkonnen courier.
    The message was explicit: Rabban was being abandoned to his own resources here on Arrakis! He could not call for help or reinforcements!
    Again, Paul raised his voice: "You think it's time I called out Stilgar and changed the leadership of the troops!" Before they could respond, Paul hurled his voice at them in anger: "Do you think the Lisan al-Gaib that stupid?" 
    There was stunned silence.
    He's accepting the religious mantle, Jessica thought. He must not do it!
    "It's the way!" someone shouted.
    Paul spoke dryly, probing the emotional undercurrents. "Ways change."
    An angry voice lifted from a corner of the cavern: "We'll say what's to change!" 
    There were scattered shouts of agreement through the throng. 
    "As you wish," Paul said.
    And Jessica heard the subtle intonations as he used the powers of Voice she had taught him.
    "You will say," he agreed. "But first you will hear my say." 
    Stilgar moved along the ledge, his bearded face impassive. "That is the way, too," he said. "The voice of any Fremen may be heard in Council. Paul-Muad'Dib is a Fremen."
    "The good of the tribe, that is the most important thing, eh?" Paul asked.
    Still with that flat-voiced dignity, Stilgar said: "Thus our steps are guided."
    "All right," Paul said. "Then, who rules this troop of our tribe -- and who rules all the tribes and troops through the fighting instructors we've trained in the weirding way?"
    Paul waited, looking over the heads of the throng. No answer came.
    Presently, he said: "Does Stilgar rule all this? He says himself that he does not. Do I rule? Even Stilgar does my bidding on occasion, and the sages, the wisest of the wise, listen to me and honor me in Council."
    There was shuffling silence among the crowd.
    "So," Paul said. "Does my mother rule?" He pointed down to Jessica in her black robes of office among them. "Stilgar and all the other troop leaders ask her advice in almost every major decision. You know this. But does a Reverend Mother walk the sand or lead a razzia against the Harkonnens?"
    Frowns creased the foreheads of those Paul could see, but still there were angry murmurs.
    This is a dangerous way to do it, Jessica thought, but she remembered the message cylinder and what it implied. And she saw Paul's intent: Go right to the depth of their uncertainty, dispose of that, and all the rest must follow.
    "No man recognizes leadership without the challenge and the combat, eh?" Paul asked.
    "That's the way!" someone shouted.
    "What's our goal?" Paul asked. "To unseat Rabban, the Harkonnen beast, and remake our world into a place where we may raise our families in happiness amidst an abundance of water -- is this our goal?" 
    "Hard tasks need hard ways," someone shouted.
    "Do you smash your knife before a battle?" Paul demanded. "I say this as fact, not meaning it as boast or challenge: there isn't a man here, Stilgar included, who could stand against me in single combat. This is Stilgar's own admission. He knows it, so do you all."
    Again, the angry mutters lifted from the crowd.
    "Many of you have been with me on the practice floor," Paul said. "You know this isn't idle boast. I say it because it's fact known to us all, and I'd be foolish not to see it for myself. I began training in these ways earlier than you did and my teachers were tougher than any you've ever seen. How else do you think I bested Jamis at an age when your boys are still fighting only mock battles?"
    He's using the Voice well, Jessica thought, but that's not enough with these people. They've good insulation against vocal control. He must catch them also with logic.
    "So," Paul said, "we come to this." He lifted the message cylinder, removed its scrap of tape. "This was taken from a Harkonnen courier. Its authenticity is beyond question. It is addressed to Rabban. It tells him that his request for new troops is denied, that his spice harvest is far below quota, that he must wring more spice from Arrakis with the people he has." 
    Stilgar moved up beside Paul.
    "How many of you see what this means?" Paul asked. "Stilgar saw it immediately."
    "They're cut off!" someone shouted.
    Paul pushed message and cylinder into his sash. From his neck he took a braided shigawire cord and removed a ring from the cord, holding the ring aloft.
    "This was my father's ducal signet," he said. "I swore never to wear it again until I was ready to lead my troops over all of Arrakis and claim it as my rightful fief." He put the ring on his finger, clenched his fist.
    Utter stillness gripped the cavern.
    "Who rules here?" Paul asked. He raised his fist. "I rule here! I rule on every square inch of Arrakis! This is my ducal fief whether the Emperor says yea or nay! He gave it to my father and it comes to me through my father!"
    Paul lifted himself onto his toes, settled back to his heels. He studied the crowd, feeling their temper. 
    Almost, he thought.
    "There are men here who will hold positions of importance on Arrakis when I claim those Imperial rights which are mine," Paul said. "Stilgar is one of those men. Not because I wish to bribe him! Not out of gratitude, though I'm one of many here who owe him life for life. No! But because he's wise and strong. Because he governs this troop by his own intelligence and not just by rules. Do you think me stupid? Do you think I'll cut off my right arm and leave it bloody on the floor of this cavern just to provide you with a circus?" 
    Paul swept a hard gaze across the throng. "Who is there here to say I'm not the rightful ruler on Arrakis? Must I prove it by leaving every Fremen tribe in the erg without a leader?" 
    Beside Paul, Stilgar stirred, looked at him questioningly.
    "Will I subtract from our strength when we need it most?" Paul asked. "I am your ruler, and I say to you that it is time we stopped killing off our best men and started killing our real enemies -- the Harkonnens!"
    In one blurred motion, Stilgar had his crysknife out and pointed over the heads of the throng. "Long live Duke Paul-Muad'Dib!" he shouted.
    A deafening roar filled the cavern, echoed and re-echoed. They were cheering and chanting: "Ya hya chouhada! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Ya hya chouhada!"
    Jessica translated it to herself: "Long live the fighters of Muad'Dib!" The scene she and Paul and Stilgar had cooked up between them had worked as they'd planned. 
    The tumult died slowly.
    When silence was restored, Paul faced Stilgar, said: "Kneel, Stilgar."
    Stilgar dropped to his knees on the ledge. 
    "Hand me your crysknife," Paul said. 
    Stilgar obeyed.
    This was not as we planned it, Jessica thought.
    "Repeat after me, Stilgar," Paul said, and he called up the words of investiture as he had heard his own father use them. "I, Stilgar, take this knife from the hands of my Duke."
    "I, Stilgar, take this knife from the hands of my Duke," Stilgar said, and accepted the milky blade from Paul.
    "Where my Duke commands, there shall I place this blade," Paul said.
    Stilgar repeated the words, speaking slowly and solemnly.
    Remembering the source of the rite, Jessica blinked back tears, shook her head. I know the reasons for this, she thought. I shouldn't let it stir me.
    "I dedicate this blade to the cause of my Duke and the death of his enemies for as long as our blood shall flow," Paul said. 
    Stilgar repeated it after him. 
    "Kiss the blade," Paul ordered.
    Stilgar obeyed, then, in the Fremen manner, kissed Paul's knife arm. At a nod from Paul, he sheathed the blade, got to his feet.
    A sighing whisper of awe passed through the crowd, and Jessica heard the words: "The prophecy -- A Bene Gesserit shall show the way and a Reverend Mother shall see it." And, from farther away: "She shows us through her son!"
    "Stilgar leads this tribe," Paul said. "Let no man mistake that. He commands with my voice. What he tells you, it is as though I told you."
    Wise, Jessica thought. The tribal commander must lose no face among those who should obey him.
    Paul lowered his voice, said: "Stilgar, I want sandwalkers out this night and cielagos sent to summon a Council Gathering. When you've sent them, bring Chatt, Korba and Otheym and two other lieutenants of your own choosing. Bring them to my quarters for battle planning. We must have a victory to show the Council of Leaders when they arrive."
    Paul nodded for his mother to accompany him, led the way down off the ledge and through the throng toward the central passage and the living chambers that had been prepared there. As Paul pressed through the crowd, hands reached out to touch him. Voices called out to him.
    "My knife goes where Stilgar commands it, Paul-Muad'Dib! Let us fight soon, Paul-Muad'Dib! Let us wet our world with the blood of Harkonnens!"
    Feeling the emotions of the throng, Jessica sensed the fighting edge of these people. They could not be more ready. We are taking them at the crest, she thought.
    In the inner chamber, Paul motioned his mother to be seated, said: "Wait here." And he ducked through the hangings to the side passage.
    It was quiet in the chamber after Paul had gone, so quiet behind the hangings that not even the faint soughing of the wind pumps that circulated air in the sietch penetrated to where she sat.
    He is going to bring Gurney Halleck here, she thought. And she wondered at the strange mingling of emotions that filled her. Gurney and his music had been a part of so many pleasant times on Caladan before the move to Arrakis. She felt that Caladan had happened to some other person. In the nearly three years since then, she had become another person. Having to confront Gurney forced a reassessment of the changes.
    Paul's coffee service, the fluted alloy of silver and jasmium that he had inherited from Jamis, rested on a low table to her right. She stared at it, thinking of how many hands had touched that metal. Chani had served Paul from it within the month.
    What can his desert woman do for a Duke except serve him coffee? she asked herself. She brings him no power, no family. Paul has only one major chance -- to ally himself with a powerful Great House, perhaps even with the Imperial family. There are marriageable princesses, after all, and every one of them Bene Gesserit trained.
    Jessica imagined herself leaving the rigors of Arrakis for the life of power and security she could know as mother of a royal consort. She glanced at the thick hangings that obscured the rock of this cavern cell, thinking of how she had come here -- riding amidst a host of worms, the palanquins and pack platforms piled high with necessities for the coming campaign.
    As long as Chani lives, Paul will not see his duty, Jessica thought. She has given him a son and that is enough.
    A sudden longing to see her grandson, the child whose likeness carried so much of the grandfather's features -- so like Leto, swept through her. Jessica placed her palms against her cheeks, began the ritual breathing that stilled emotion and clarified the mind, then bent forward from the waist in the devotional exercise that prepared the body for the mind's demands.
    Paul's choice of this Cave of Birds as his command post could not be questioned, she knew. It was ideal. And to the north lay Wind Pass opening onto a protected village in a cliff-walled sink. It was a key village, home of artisans and technicians, maintenance center for an entire Harkonnen defensive sector.
    A cough sounded outside the chamber hangings. Jessica straightened, took a deep breath, exhaled slowly. "Enter," she said.
    Draperies were flung aside and Gurney Halleck bounded into the room. She had only time for a glimpse of his face with its odd grimace, then he was behind her, lifting her to her feet with one brawny arm beneath her chin.
    "Gurney, you fool, what are you doing?" she demanded.
    Then she felt the touch of the knife tip against her back. Chill awareness spread out from that knife tip. She knew in that instant that Gurney meant to kill her. Why? She could think of no reason, for he wasn't the kind to turn traitor. But she felt certain of his intention. Knowing it, her mind churned. Here was no man to be overcome easily. Here was a killer wary of the Voice, wary of every combat stratagem, wary of every trick of death and violence. Here was an instrument she herself had helped train with subtle hints and suggestions.
    "You thought you had escaped, eh, witch?" Gurney snarled.
    Before she could turn the question over in her mind or try to answer, the curtains parted and Paul entered.
    "Here he is, Moth --" Paul broke off, taking in the tensions of the scene.
    "You will stand where you are, m'Lord," Gurney said. 
    "What . . . " Paul shook his head.
    Jessica started to speak, felt the arm tighten against her throat.
    "You will speak only when I permit it, witch," Gurney said. "I want only one thing from you for your son to hear it, and I am prepared to send this knife into your heart by reflex at the first sign of a counter against me. Your voice will remain in a monotone. Certain muscles you will not tense or move. You will act with the most extreme caution to gain yourself a few more seconds of life. And I assure you, these are all you have." 
    Paul took a step forward. "Gurney, man, what is --" 
    "Stop right where you are!" Gurney snapped. "One more step and she's dead."
    Paul's hand slipped to his knife hilt. He spoke in a deadly quiet: "You had best explain yourself, Gurney."
    "I swore an oath to slay the betrayer of your father," Gurney said. "Do you think I can forget the man who rescued me from a Harkonnen slave pit, gave me freedom, life, and honor . . . gave me friendship, a thing I prized above all else? I have his betrayer under my knife. No one can stop me from --" 
    "You couldn't be more wrong, Gurney," Paul said. 
    And Jessica thought: So that's it! What irony!
    "Wrong, am I?" Gurney demanded. "Let us hear it from the woman herself. And let her remember that I have bribed and spied and cheated to confirm this charge. I've even pushed semuta on a Harkonnen guard captain to get part of the story." 
    Jessica felt the arm at her throat ease slightly, but before she could speak, Paul said: "The betrayer was Yueh. I tell you this once, Gurney. The evidence is complete, cannot be controverted. It was Yueh. I do not care how you came by your suspicion -- for it can be nothing else -- but if you harm my mother . . . " Paul lifted his crysknife from its scabbard, held the blade in front of him. ". . . I'll have your blood."
    "Yueh was a conditioned medic, fit for a royal house," Gurney snarled. "He could not turn traitor!" 
    "I know a way to remove that conditioning," Paul said. 
    "Evidence," Gurney insisted.
    "The evidence is not here," Paul said. "It's in Tabr sietch, far to the south, but if --"
    "This is a trick," Gurney snarled, and his arm tightened on Jessica's throat.
    "No trick, Gurney," Paul said, and his voice carried such a note of terrible sadness that the sound tore at Jessica's heart.
    "I saw the message captured from the Harkonnen agent," Gurney said. "The note pointed directly at --"
    "I saw it, too," Paul said. "My father showed it to me the night he explained why it had to be a Harkonnen trick aimed at making him suspect the woman he loved." 
    "Ayah!" Gurney said. "You've not --"
    "Be quiet," Paul said, and the monotone stillness of his words carried more command than Jessica had ever heard in another voice. 
    He has the Great Control, she thought.
    Gurney's arm trembled against her neck. The point of the knife at her back moved with uncertainty.
    "What you have not done," Paul said, "is heard my mother sobbing in the night over her lost Duke. You have not seen her eyes stab flame when she speaks of killing Harkonnens." 
    So he has listened, she thought. Tears blinded her eyes.
    "What you have not done," Paul went on, "is remembered the lessons you learned in a Harkonnen slave pit. You speak of pride in my father's friendship! Didn't you learn the difference between Harkonnen and Atreides so that you could smell a Harkonnen trick by the stink they left on it? Didn't you learn that Atreides loyalty is bought with love while the Harkonnen coin is hate? Couldn't you see through to the very nature of this betrayal?" 
    "But Yueh?" Gurney muttered.
    "The evidence we have is Yueh's own message to us admitting his treachery," Paul said. "I swear this to you by the love I hold for you, a love I will still hold even after I leave you dead on this floor." 
    Hearing her son, Jessica marveled at the awareness in him, the penetrating insight of his intelligence.
    "My father had an instinct for his friends," Paul said. "He gave his love sparingly, but with never an error. His weakness lay in misunderstanding hatred. He thought anyone who hated Harkonnens could not betray him." He glanced at his mother. "She knows this. I've given her my father's message that he never distrusted her."
    Jessica felt herself losing control, bit at her lower lip. Seeing the stiff formality in Paul, she realized what these words were costing him. She wanted to run to him, cradle his head against her breast as she never had done. But the arm against her throat had ceased its trembling; the knifepoint at her back pressed still and sharp.
    "One of the most terrible moments in a boy's life," Paul said, "is when he discovers his father and mother are human beings who share a love that he can never quite taste. It's a loss, an awakening to the fact that the world is there and here and we are in it alone. The moment carries its own truth; you can't evade it. I heard my father when he spoke of my mother. She's not the betrayer, Gurney." 
    Jessica found her voice, said: "Gurney, release me." There was no special command in the words, no trick to play on his weaknesses, but Gurney's hand fell away. She crossed to Paul, stood in front of him, not touching him.
    "Paul," she said, "there are other awakenings in this universe. I suddenly see how I've used you and twisted you and manipulated you to set you on a course of my choosing . . . a course I had to choose -- if that's any excuse -- because of my own training." She swallowed past a lump in her throat, looked up into her son's eyes. "Paul . . . I want you to do something for me: choose the course of happiness. Your desert woman, marry her if that's your wish. Defy everyone and everything to do this. But choose your own course. I . . . " 
    She broke off, stopped by the low sound of muttering behind her. 
    Gurney!
    She saw Paul's eyes directed beyond her, turned.
    Gurney stood in the same spot, but had sheathed his knife, pulled the robe away from his breast to expose the slick grayness of an issue stillsuit, the type the smugglers traded for among the sietch warrens.
    "Put your knife right here in my breast," Gurney muttered. "I say kill me and have done with it. I've besmirched my name. I've betrayed my own Duke! The finest --" 
    "Be still!" Paul said. 
    Gurney stared at him.
    "Close that robe and stop acting like a fool," Paul said. "I've had enough foolishness for one day." 
    "Kill me, I say!" Gurney raged.
    "You know me better than that," Paul said. "How many kinds of an idiot do you think I am? Must I go through this with every man I need?"
    Gurney looked at Jessica, spoke in a forlorn, pleading note so unlike him: "Then you, my Lady, please . . . you kill me."
    Jessica crossed to him, put her hands on his shoulders. "Gurney, why do you insist the Atreides must kill those they love?" Gently, she pulled the spread robe out of his fingers, closed and fastened the fabric over his chest.
    Gurney spoke brokenly; "But . . . I . . . "
    "You thought you were doing a thing for Leto," she said, "and for this I honor you."
    "My Lady," Gurney said. He dropped his chin to his chest, squeezed his eyelids closed against the tears.
    "Let us think of this as a misunderstanding among old friends," she said, and Paul heard the soothers, the adjusting tones in her voice. "It's over and we can be thankful we'll never again have that sort of misunderstanding between us." 
    Gurney opened eyes bright with moisture, looked down at her.
    "The Gurney Halleck I knew was a man adept with both blade and baliset," Jessica said. "It was the man of the baliset I most admired. Doesn't that Gurney Halleck remember how I used to enjoy listening by the hour while he played for me? Do you still have a baliset, Gurney?"
    "I've a new one," Gurney said. "Brought from Chusuk, a sweet instrument. Plays like a genuine Varota, though there's no signature on it. I think myself it was made by a student of Varota's who . . ." He broke off. "What can I say to you, my Lady? Here we prattle about --"
    "Not prattle, Gurney," Paul said. He crossed to stand beside his mother, eye to eye with Gurney. "Not prattle, but a thing that brings happiness between friends. I'd take it a kindness if you'd play for her now. Battle planning can wait a little while. We'll not be going into the fight till tomorrow at any rate."
    "I . . . I'll get my baliset," Gurney said. "It's in the passage." He stepped around them and through the hangings.
    Paul put a hand on his mother's arm, found that she was trembling.
    "It's over, Mother," he said.
    Without turning her head, she looked up at him from the corners of her eyes. "Over?" 
    "Of course. Gurney's . . . " 
    "Gurney? Oh . . . yes." She lowered her gaze.
    The hangings rustled as Gurney returned with his baliset. He began tuning it, avoiding their eyes. The hangings on the walls dulled the echoes, making the instrument sound small and intimate.
    Paul led his mother to a cushion, seated her there with her back to the thick draperies of the wall. He was suddenly struck by how old she seemed to him with the beginnings of desert-dried lines in her face, the stretching at the corners of her blue-veiled eyes.
    She's tired, he thought. We must find some way to ease her burdens.
    Gurney strummed a chord.
    Paul glanced at him, said: "I've . . . things that need my attention. Wait here for me."
    Gurney nodded. His mind seemed far away, as though he dwelled for this moment beneath the open skies of Caladan with cloud fleece on the horizon promising rain.
    Paul forced himself to turn away, let himself out through the heavy hangings over the side passage. He heard Gurney take up a tune behind him, and paused a moment outside the room to listen to the muted music.

"Orchards and vineyards, 
And full-breasted houris, 
And a cup overflowing before me. 
Why do I babble of battles, 
And mountains reduced to dust? 
Why do I feel these tears?

Heavens stand open 
And scatter their riches; 
My hands need but gather their wealth.
Why do I think of an ambush, 
And poison in molten cup? 
Why do I feel my years?

Love's arms beckon 
With their naked delights, 
And Eden's promise of ecstasies. 
Why do I remember the scars, 
Dream of old transgressions . . .
And why do I sleep with fears?"

    A robed Fedaykin courier appeared from a corner of the passage ahead of Paul. The man had hood thrown back and fastenings of his stillsuit hanging loose about his neck, proof that he had come just now from the open desert.
    Paul motioned for him to stop, left the hangings of the door and moved down the passage to the courier.
    The man bowed, hands clasped in front of him the way he might greet a Reverend Mother or Sayyadina of the rites. He said: "Muad'Dib, leaders are beginning to arrive for the Council." 
    "So soon?"
    "These are the ones Stilgar sent for earlier when it was thought . . ." He shrugged.
    "I see." Paul glanced back toward the faint sound of the baliset, thinking of the old song that his mother favored -- an odd stretching of happy tune and sad words. "Stilgar will come here soon with others. Show them where my mother waits." 
    "I will wait here, Muad'Dib," the courier said. 
    "Yes . . . yes, do that."
    Paul pressed past the man toward the depths of the cavern, headed for the place that each such cavern had -- a place near its water-holding basin. There would be a small shai-hulud in this place, a creature no more than nine meters long, kept stunted and trapped by surrounding water ditches. The maker, after emerging from its little maker vector, avoided water for the poison it was. And the drowning of a maker was the greatest Fremen secret because it produced the substance of their union -- the Water of Life, the poison that could only be changed by a Reverend Mother.
    The decision had come to Paul while he faced the tension of danger to his mother. No line of the future he had ever seen carried that moment, of peril from Gurney Halleck. The future -- the gray-cloud-future -- with its feeling that the entire universe rolled toward a boiling nexus hung around him like a phantom world.
    I must see it, he thought.
    His body had slowly acquired a certain spice tolerance that made prescient visions fewer and fewer . . . dimmer and dimmer. The solution appeared obvious to him.
    I will drown the maker. We will see now whether I'm the Kwisatz Haderach who can survive the test that the Reverend Mothers have survived.

And it came to pass in the third year of the Desert War that Paul-Muad'Dib lay alone in the Cave of Birds beneath the kiswa hangings of an inner cell. And he lay as one dead, caught up in the revelation of the Water of Life, his being translated beyond the boundaries of time by the poison that gives life. Thus was the prophecy made true that the Lisan al-Gaib might be both dead and alive.
-"Collected Legends of Arrakis" by the Princess Irulan

    Chani came up out of the Habbanya basin in the predawn darkness, hearing the 'thopter that had brought her from the south go whir-whirring off to a hiding place in the vastness. Around her, the escort kept its distance, fanning out into the rocks of the ridge to probe for dangers -- and giving the mate of Muad'Dib, the mother of his firstborn, the thing she had requested: a moment to walk alone.
    Why did he summon me? she asked herself. He told me before that I must remain in the south with little Leto and Alia.
    She gathered her robe and leaped lightly up across a barrier rock and onto the climbing path that only the desert-trained could recognize in the darkness. Pebbles slithered underfoot and she danced across them without considering the nimbleness required.
    The climb was exhilarating, easing the fears that had fermented in her because of her escort's silent withdrawal and the fact that a precious 'thopter had been sent for her. She felt the inner leaping at the nearness of reunion with Paul-Muad'Dib, her Usul. His name might be a battle cry over all the land: "Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!" But she knew a different man by a different name -- the father of her son, the tender lover.
    A great figure loomed out of the rocks above her, beckoning for speed. She quickened her pace. Dawn birds already were calling and lifting into the sky. A dim spread of light grew across the eastern horizon.
    The figure above was not one of her own escort. Otheym? she wondered, marking a familiarity of movement and manner. She came up to him, recognized in the growing light the broad, flat features of the Fedaykin lieutenant, his hood open and mouth filter loosely fastened the way one did sometimes when venturing out on the desert for only a moment.
    "Hurry," he hissed, and led her down the secret crevasse into the hidden cave. "It will be light soon," he whispered as he held a doorseal open for her. "The Harkonnens have been making desperation patrols over some of this region. We dare not chance discovery now."
    They emerged into the narrow side-passage entrance to the Cave of Birds. Glowglobes came alight. Otheym pressed past her, said: "Follow me. Quickly, now."
    They sped down the passage, through another valve door, another passage and through hangings into what had been the Sayyadina's alcove in the days when this was an overday rest cave. Rugs and cushions now covered the floor. Woven hangings with the red figure of a hawk hid the rock walls. A low field desk at one side was strewn with papers from which lifted the aroma of their spice origin.
    The Reverend Mother sat alone directly opposite the entrance. She looked up with the inward stare that made the uninitiated tremble.
    Otheym pressed palms together, said: "I have brought Chani." He bowed, retreated through the hangings. 
    And Jessica thought: How do I tell Chani? 
    "How is my grandson?" Jessica asked.
    So it's to be the ritual greeting, Chani thought, and her fears returned. Where is Muad'Dib? Why isn't he here to greet me?
    "He is healthy and happy, my mother," Chani said. "I left him with Alia in the care of Harah."
    My mother, Jessica thought. Yes, she has the right to call me that in the formal greeting. She has given me a grandson.
    "I hear a gift of cloth has been sent from Coanua sietch," Jessica said.
    "It is lovely cloth," Chani said. 
    "Does Alia send a message?"
    "No message. But the sietch moves more smoothly now that the people are beginning to accept the miracle of her status." 
    Why does she drag this out so? Chani wondered. Something was so urgent that they sent a 'thopter for me. Now, we drag through the formalities!
    "We must have some of the new cloth cut into garments for little Leto," Jessica said.
    "Whatever you wish, my mother," Chani said. She lowered her gaze. "Is there news of battles?" She held her face expressionless that Jessica might not see the betrayal -- that this was a question about Paul Muad'Dib.
    "New victories," Jessica said. "Rabban has sent cautious overtures about a truce. His messengers have been returned without their water. Rabban has even lightened the burdens of the people in some of the sink villages. But he is too late. "The people know he does it out of fear of us."
    "Thus it goes as Muad'Dib said," Chani said. She stared at Jessica, trying to keep her fears to herself. I have spoken his name, but she has not responded. One cannot see emotion in that glazed stone she calls a face . . . but she is too frozen. Why is she so still? What has happened to my Usul?
    "I wish we were in the south," Jessica said. "The oases were so beautiful when we left. Do you not long for the day when the whole land may blossom thus?"
    "The land is beautiful, true," Chani said. "But there is much grief in it." 
    "Grief is the price of victory," Jessica said.
    Is she preparing me for grief? Chani asked herself. She said: "There are so many women without men. There was jealousy when it was learned that I'd been summoned north." 
    "I summoned you," Jessica said.
    Chani felt her heart hammering. She wanted to clap her hands to her ears, fearful of what they might hear. Still, she kept her voice even: "The message was signed Muad'Dib."
    "I signed it thus in the presence of his lieutenants," Jessica said. "It was a subterfuge of necessity." And Jessica thought: This is a brave woman, my Paul's. She holds to the niceties even when fear is almost overwhelming her. Yes. She may be the one we need now.
    Only the slightest tone of resignation crept into Chani's voice as she said: "Now you may say the thing that must be said." 
    "You were needed here to help me revive Paul," Jessica said. And she thought: There! I said it in the precisely correct way. Revive. Thus she knows Paul is alive and knows there is peril, all in the same word.
    Chani took only a moment to calm herself, then: "What is it I may do?" She wanted to leap at Jessica, shake her and scream: "Take me to him!" But she waited silently for the answer.
    "I suspect," Jessica said, "that the Harkonnens have managed to send an agent among us to poison Paul. It's the only explanation that seems to fit. A most unusual poison. I've examined his blood in the most subtle ways without detecting it."
    Chani thrust herself forward onto her knees. "Poison? Is he in pain? Could I . . . "
    "He is unconscious," Jessica said. "The processes of his life are so low that they can be detected only with the most refined techniques. I shudder to think what could have happened had I not been the one to discover him. He appears dead to the untrained eye." 
    "You have reasons other than courtesy for summoning me," Chani said. "I know you, Reverend Mother. What is it you think I may do that you cannot do?"
    She is brave, lovely and, ah-h-h, so perceptive, Jessica thought. She'd have made a fine Bene Gesserit.
    "Chani," Jessica said, "you may find this difficult to believe, but I do not know precisely why I sent for you. It was an instinct . . . a basic intuition. The thought came unbidden: 'Send for Chani.' " 
    For the first time, Chani saw the sadness in Jessica's expression, the unveiled pain modifying the inward stare.
    "I've done all I know to do," Jessica said. "That all . . . it is so far beyond what is usually supposed as all that you would find difficulty imagining it. Yet . . . I failed."
    "The old companion, Halleck," Chani asked, "is it possible he's a traitor?" 
    "Not Gurney," Jessica said.
    The two words carried an entire conversation, and Chani saw the searching, the tests . . . the memories of old failures that went into this flat denial.
    Chani rocked back onto her feet, stood up, smoothed her desert-stained robe. "Take me to him," she said.
    Jessica arose, turned through hangings on the left wall.
    Chani followed, found herself in what had been a storeroom, its rock walls concealed now beneath heavy draperies. Paul lay on a field pad against the far wall. A single glowglobe above him illuminated his face. A black robe covered him to the chest, leaving his arms outside it stretched along his sides. He appeared to be unclothed under the robe. The skin exposed looked waxen, rigid. There was no visible movement to him.
    Chani suppressed the desire to dash forward, throw herself across him. She found her thoughts, instead, going to her son -- Leto. And she realized in this instant that Jessica once had faced such a moment -- her man threatened by death, forced in her own mind to consider what might be done to save a young son. The realization formed a sudden bond with the older woman so that Chani reached out and clasped Jessica's hand. The answering grip was painful in its intensity.
    "He lives," Jessica said. "I assure you he lives. But the thread of his life is so thin it could easily escape detection. There are some among the leaders already muttering that the mother speaks and not the Reverend Mother, that my son is truly dead and I do not want to give up his water to the tribe."
    "How long has he been this way?" Chani asked. She disengaged her hand from Jessica's, moved farther into the room.
    "Three weeks," Jessica said. "I spent almost a week trying to revive him. There were meetings, arguments . . . investigations. Then I sent for you. The Fedaykin obey my orders, else I might not have been able to delay the . . . " She wet her lips with her tongue, watching Chani cross to Paul.
    Chani stood over him now, looking down on the soft beard of youth that framed his face, tracing with her eyes the high browline, the strong nose, the shuttered eyes -- the features so peaceful in this rigid repose.
    "How does he take nourishment?" Chani asked.
    "The demands of his flesh are so slight he does not yet need food," Jessica said.
    "How many know of what has happened?" Chani asked.
    "Only his closest advisers, a few of the leaders, the Fedaykin and, of course, whoever administered the poison." 
    "There is no clue to the poisoner?" 
    "And it's not for want of investigating," Jessica said. 
    "What do the Fedaykin say?" Chani asked.
    "They believe Paul is in a sacred trance, gathering his holy powers before the final battles. This is a thought I've cultivated." 
    Chani lowered herself to her knees beside the pad, bent close to Paul's face. She sensed an immediate difference in the air about his face . . . but it was only the spice, the ubiquitous spice whose odor permeated everything in Fremen life. Still . . . 
    "You were not born to the spice as we were," Chani said. "Have you investigated the possibility that his body has rebelled against too much spice in his diet?"
    "Allergy reactions are all negative," Jessica said.
    She closed her eyes, as much to blot out this scene as because of sudden realization of fatigue. How long have I been without sleep? she asked herself. Too long.
    "When you change the Water of Life," Chani said, "you do it within yourself by the inward awareness. Have you used this awareness to test his blood?"
    "Normal Fremen blood," Jessica said. "Completely adapted to the diet and the life here."
    Chani sat back on her heels, submerging her fears in thought as she studied Paul's face. This was a trick she had learned from watching the Reverend Mothers. Time could be made to serve the mind. One concentrated the entire attention. 
    Presently, Chani said: "Is there a maker here?" 
    "There are several," Jessica said with a touch of weariness. "We are never without them these days. Each victory requires its blessing. Each ceremony before a raid --"
    "But Paul Muad'Dib has held himself aloof from these ceremonies," Chani said.
    Jessica nodded to herself, remembering her son's ambivalent feelings toward the spice drug and the prescient awareness it precipitated.
    "How did you know this?" Jessica asked. 
    "It is spoken." 
    "Too much is spoken," Jessica said bitterly. 
    "Get me the raw Water of the maker," Chani said.
    Jessica stiffened at the tone of command in Chani's voice, then observed the intense concentration in the younger woman and said: "At once." She went out through the hangings to send a waterman.
    Chani sat staring at Paul. If he has tried to do this, she thought. And it's the sort of thing he might try . . . 
    Jessica knelt beside Chani, holding out a plain camp ewer. The charged odor of the poison was sharp in Chani's nostrils. She dipped a finger in the fluid, held the finger close to Paul's nose.
    The skin along the bridge of his nose wrinkled slightly. Slowly, the nostrils flared. 
    Jessica gasped.
    Chani touched the dampened finger to Paul's upper lip. 
    He drew in a long, sobbing breath. "What is this?" Jessica demanded.
    "Be still," Chani said. "You must convert a small amount of the sacred water. Quickly!"
    Without questioning, because she recognized the tone of awareness in Chani's voice, Jessica lifted the ewer to her mouth, drew in a small sip.
    Paul's eyes flew open. He stared upward at Chani.
    "It is not necessary for her to change the Water," he said. His voice was weak, but steady.
    Jessica, a sip of the fluid on her tongue, found her body rallying, converting the poison almost automatically. In the light elevation the ceremony always imparted, she sensed the life-glow from Paul -- a radiation there registering on her senses. 
    In that instant, she knew.
    "You drank the sacred water!" she blurted. 
    "One drop of it," Paul said. "So small . . . one drop." 
    "How could you do such a foolish thing?" she demanded. 
    "He is your son," Chani said. 
    Jessica glared at her.
    A rare smile, warm and full of understanding, touched Paul's lips. "Hear my beloved," he said. "Listen to her, Mother. She knows." 
    "A thing that others can do, he must do," Chani said.
    "When I had the drop in my mouth, when I felt it and smelled it, when I knew what it was doing to me, then I knew I could do the thing that you have done," he said. "Your Bene Gesserit proctors speak of the Kwisatz Haderach, but they cannot begin to guess the many places I have been. In the few minutes I . . . " He broke off, looking at Chani with a puzzled frown. "Chani? How did you get here? You're supposed to be . . . Why are you here?" 
    He tried to push himself onto his elbows. Chani pressed him back gently.
    "Please, my Usul," she said.
    "I feel so weak," he said. His gaze darted around the room. "How long have I been here?"
    "You've been three weeks in a coma so deep that the spark of life seemed to have fled," Jessica said.
    "But it was . . . I took it just a moment ago and . . . " 
    "A moment for you, three weeks of fear for me," Jessica said.
    "It was only one drop, but I converted it," Paul said. "I changed the Water of Life." And before Chani or Jessica could stop him, he dipped his hand into the ewer they had placed on the floor beside him, and he brought the dripping hand to his mouth, swallowed the palm-cupped liquid.
    "Paul!" Jessica screamed.
    He grabbed her hand, faced her with a death's head grin, and he sent his awareness surging over her.
    The rapport was not as tender, not as sharing, not as encompassing as it had been with Alia and with the Old Reverend Mother in the cavern . . . but it was a rapport: a sense-sharing of the entire being. It shook her, weakened her, and she cowered in her mind, fearful of him.
    Aloud, he said: "You speak of a place where you cannot enter? This place which the Reverend Mother cannot face, show it to me." 
    She shook her head, terrified by the very thought. 
    "Show it to me!" he commanded. 
    "No!"
    But she could not escape him. Bludgeoned by the terrible force of him, she closed her eyes and focused inward -- the-direction-that-is-dark.
    Paul's consciousness flowed through and around her and into the darkness. She glimpsed the place dimly before her mind blanked itself away from the terror. Without knowing why, her whole being trembled at what she had seen -- a region where a wind blew and sparks glared, where rings of light expanded and contracted, where rows of tumescent white shapes flowed over and under and around the lights, driven by darkness and a wind out of nowhere.
    Presently, she opened her eyes, saw Paul staring up at her. He still held her hand, but the terrible rapport was gone. She quieted her trembling. Paul released her hand. It was as though some crutch had been removed. She staggered up and back, would have fallen had not Chani jumped to support her.
    "Reverend Mother!" Chani said. "What is wrong?" 
    "Tired," Jessica whispered. "So . . . tired."
    "Here," Chani said. "Sit here." She helped Jessica to a cushion against the wall.
    The strong young arms felt so good to Jessica. She clung to Chani.
    "He has, in truth, seen the Water of Life?" Chani asked. She disengaged herself from Jessica's grip.
    "He has seen," Jessica whispered. Her mind still rolled and surged from the contact. It was like stepping to solid land after weeks on a heaving sea. She sensed the old Reverend Mother within her . . . and all the others awakened and questioning; "What was that? What happened? Where was that place?"
    Through it all threaded the realization that her son was the Kwisatz Haderach, the one who could be many places at once. He was the fact out of the Bene Gesserit dream. And the fact gave her no peace.
    "What happened?" Chani demanded. 
    Jessica shook her head.
    Paul said: "There is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an ancient force that gives. A man finds little difficulty facing that place within himself where the taking force dwells, but it's almost impossible for him to see into the giving force without changing into something other than man. For a woman, the situation is reversed." 
    Jessica looked up, found Chani was staring at her while listening to Paul.
    "Do you understand me, Mother?" Paul asked. 
    She could only nod.
    "These things are so ancient within us," Paul said, "that they're ground into each separate cell of our bodies. We're shaped by such forces. You can say to yourself, 'Yes, I see how such a thing may be.' But when you look inward and confront the raw force of your own life unshielded, you see your peril. You see that this could overwhelm you. The greatest peril to the Giver is the force that takes. The greatest peril to the Taker is the force that gives. It's as easy to be overwhelmed by giving as by taking." 
    "And you, my son," Jessica asked, "are you one who gives or one who takes?"
    "I'm at the fulcrum," he said. "I cannot give without taking and I cannot take without . . . " He broke off, looking to the wall at his right.
    Chani felt a draft against her cheek, turned to see the hangings close.
    "It was Otheym," Paul said. "He was listening." 
    Accepting the words, Chani was touched by some of the prescience that haunted Paul, and she knew a thing-yet-to-be as though it already had occurred. Otheym would speak of what he had seen and heard. Others would spread the story until it was a fire over the land. Paul-Muad'Dib is not as other men, they would say. There can be no more doubt. He is a man, yet he sees through to the Water of Life in the way of a Reverend Mother. He is indeed the Lisan al-Gaib.
    "You have seen the future, Paul," Jessica said. "Will you say what you've seen?"
    "Not the future," he said. "I've seen the Now." He forced himself to a sitting position, waved Chani aside as she moved to help him. "The Space above Arrakis is filled with the ships of the Guild." 
    Jessica trembled at the certainty in his voice.
    "The Padishah Emperor himself is there," Paul said. He looked at the rock ceiling of his cell. "With his favorite Truthsayer and five legions of Sardaukar. The old Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is there with Thufir Hawat beside him and seven ships jammed with every conscript he could muster. Every Great House has its raiders above us . . . waiting."
    Chani shook her head, unable to look away from Paul. His strangeness, the flat tone of voice, the way he looked through her, filled her with awe.
    Jessica tried to swallow in a dry throat, said: "For what are they waiting?"
    Paul looked at her. "For the Guild's permission to land. The Guild will strand on Arrakis any force that lands without permission." 
    "The Guild's protecting us?" Jessica asked.
    "Protecting us! The Guild itself caused this by spreading tales about what we do here and by reducing troop transport fares to a point where even the poorest Houses are up there now waiting to loot us."
    Jessica noted the lack of bitterness in his tone, wondered at it. She couldn't doubt his words -- they had that same intensity she'd seen in him the night he'd revealed the path of the future that'd taken them among the Fremen.
    Paul took a deep breath, said: "Mother, you must change a quantity of the Water for us. We need the catalyst. Chani, have a scout force sent out . . . to find a pre-spice mass. If we plant a quantity of the Water of Life above a pre-spice mass, do you know what will happen?"
    Jessica weighed his words, suddenly saw through to his meaning. "Paul!" she gasped.
    "The Water of Death," he said. "It'd be a chain reaction." He pointed to the floor. "Spreading death among the little makers, killing a vector of the life cycle that includes the spice and the makers. Arrakis will become a true desolation -- without spice or maker."
    Chani put a hand to her mouth, shocked to numb silence by the blasphemy pouring from Paul's lips.
    "He who can destroy a thing has the real control of it," Paul said. "We can destroy the spice." 
    "What stays the Guild's hand?" Jessica whispered.
    "They're searching for me," Paul said. "Think of that! The finest Guild navigators, men who can quest ahead through time to find the safest course for the fastest Heighliners, all of them seeking me . . .and unable to find me. How they tremble! They know I have their secret here!" Paul held out his cupped hand. "Without the spice they're blind!" 
    Chani found her voice. "You said you see the now!" 
    Paul lay back, searching the spread-out present, its limits extended into the future and into the past, holding onto the awareness with difficulty as the spice illumination began to fade.
    "Go do as I commanded," he said. "The future's becoming as muddled for the Guild as it is for me. The lines of vision are narrowing. Everything focuses here where the spice is . . . where they've dared not interfere before . . . because to interfere was to lose what they must have. But now they're desperate. All paths lead into darkness."

And that day dawned when Arrakis lay at the hub of the universe with the wheel poised to spin.
-from "Arrakis Awakening" by the Princess Irulan

    "Will you look at that thing!" Stilgar whispered.
    Paul lay beside him in a slit of rock high on the Shield Wall rim, eye fixed to the collector of a Fremen telescope. The oil lens was focused on a starship lighter exposed by dawn in the basin below them. The tall eastern face of the ship glistened in the flat light of the sun, but the shadow side still showed yellow portholes from glowglobes of the night. Beyond the ship, the city of Arrakeen lay cold and gleaming in the light of the northern sun.
    It wasn't the lighter that excited Stilgar's awe, Paul knew, but the construction for which the lighter was only the centerpost. A single metal hutment, many stories tall, reached out in a thousand-meter circle from the base of the lighter -- a tent composed of interlocking metal leaves -- the temporary lodging place for five legions of Sardaukar and His Imperial Majesty, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.
    From his position squatting at Paul's left, Gurney Halleck said: "I count nine levels to it. Must be quite a few Sardaukar in there." 
    "Five legions," Paul said.
    "It grows light," Stilgar hissed. "We like it not, your exposing yourself, Muad'Dib. Let us go back into the rocks now." 
    "I'm perfectly safe here," Paul said.
    "That ship mounts projectile weapons," Gurney said.
    "They believe us protected by shields," Paul said. "They wouldn't waste a shot on an unidentified trio even if they saw us." 
    Paul swung the telescope to scan the far wall of the basin, seeing the pockmarked cliffs, the slides that marked the tombs of so many of his father's troopers. And he had a momentary sense of the fitness of things that the shades of those men should look down on this moment. The Harkonnen forts and towns across the shielded lands lay in Fremen hands or cut away from their source like stalks severed from a plant and left to wither. Only this basin and its city remained to the enemy.
    "They might try a sortie by 'thopter," Stilgar said. "If they see us."
    "Let them," Paul said. "We've 'thopters to burn today . . . and we know a storm is coming."
    He swung the telescope to the far side of the Arrakeen landing field now, to the Harkonnen frigates lined up there with a CHOAM Company banner waving gently from its staff on the ground beneath them. And he thought of the desperation that had forced the Guild to permit these two groups to land while all the others were held in reserve. The Guild was like a man testing the sand with his toe to gauge its temperature before erecting a tent.
    "Is there anything new to see from here?" Gurney asked. "We should be getting under cover. The storm is coming." 
    Paul returned his attention on the giant hutment. "They've even brought their women," he said. "And lackeys and servants. Ah-h-h, my dear Emperor, how confident you are."
    "Men are coming up the secret way," Stilgar said. "It may be Otheym and Korba returning." 
    "All right, Stil," Paul said. "We'll go back." 
    But he took one final look around through the telescope -- studying the plain with its tall ships, the gleaming metal hutment, the silent city, the frigates of the Harkonnen mercenaries. Then he slid backward around a scarp of rock. His place at the telescope was taken by a Fedaykin guardsman.
    Paul emerged into a shallow depression in the Shield Wall's surface. It was a place about thirty meters in diameter and some three meters deep, a natural feature of the rock that the Fremen had hidden beneath a translucent camouflage cover. Communications equipment was clustered around a hole in the wall to the right. Fedaykin guards deployed through the depression waited for Muad'Dib's command to attack.
    Two men emerged from the hole by the communications equipment, spoke to the guards there.
    Paul glanced at Stilgar, nodded in the direction of the two men. "Get their report, Stil." 
    Stilgar moved to obey.
    Paul crouched with his back to the rock, stretching his muscles, straightened. He saw Stilgar sending the two men back into that dark hole in the rock, thought about the long climb down that narrow man-made tunnel to the floor of the basin. 
    Stilgar crossed to Paul.
    "What was so important that they couldn't send a cielago with the message?" Paul asked.
    "They're saving their birds for the battle," Stilgar said. He glanced at the communications equipment, back to Paul. "Even with a tight beam, it is wrong to use those things, Muad'Dib. They can find you by taking a bearing on its emission." 
    "They'll soon be too busy to find me," Paul said. "What did the men report?"
    "Our pet Sardaukar have been released near Old Gap low on the rim and are on their way to their master. The rocket launchers and other projectile weapons are in place. The people are deployed as you ordered. It was all routine."
    Paul glanced across the shallow bowl, studying his men in the filtered light admitted by the camouflage cover. He felt time creeping like an insect working its way across an exposed rock.
    "It'll take our Sardaukar a little time afoot before they can signal a troop carrier," Paul said. 
    "They are being watched?" 
    "They are being watched," Stilgar said.
    Beside Paul, Gurney Halleck cleared his throat. "Hadn't we best be getting to a place of safety?"
    "There is no such place," Paul said. "Is the weather report still favorable?"
    "A great grandmother of a storm coming," Stilgar said. "Can you not feel it, Muad'Dib?"
    "The air does feel chancy," Paul agreed. "But I like the certainty of poling the weather."
    "The storm'll be here in the hour," Stilgar said. He nodded toward the gap that looked out on the Emperor's hutment and the Harkonnen frigates. "They know it there, too. Not a 'thopter in the sky. Everything pulled in and tied down. They've had a report on the weather from their friends in space." 
    "Any more probing sorties?" Paul asked.
    "Nothing since the landing last night," Stilgar said. "They know we're here. I think now they wait to choose their own time." 
    "We choose the time," Paul said.
    Gurney glanced upward, growled: "If they let us." 
    "That fleet'll stay in space," Paul said. 
    Gurney shook his head.
    "They have no choice," Paul said. "We can destroy the spice. The Guild dares not risk that." 
    "Desperate people are the most dangerous," Gurney said. 
    "Are we not desperate?" Stilgar asked. 
    Gurney scowled at him.
    "You haven't lived with the Fremen dream," Paul cautioned. "Stil is thinking of all the water we've spent on bribes, the years of waiting we've added before Arrakis can bloom. He's not --" 
    "Arrrgh," Gurney scowled.
    "Why's he so gloomy?" Stilgar asked.
    "He's always gloomy before a battle," Paul said. "It's the only form of good humor Gurney allows himself."
    A slow, wolfish grin spread across Gurney's face, the teeth showing white above the chip cup of his stillsuit. "It glooms me much to think on all the poor Harkonnen souls we'll dispatch unshriven," he said.
    Stilgar chuckled. "He talks like a Fedaykin."
    "Gurney was born a death commando," Paul said. And he thought: Yes, let them occupy their minds with small talk be fore we test ourselves against that force on the plain. He looked to the gap in the rock wall and back to Gurney, found that the troubadour-warrior had resumed a brooding scowl.
    "Worry saps the strength," Paul murmured. "You told me that once, Gurney."
    "My Duke," Gurney said, "my chief worry is the atomics. If you use them to blast a hole in the Shield Wall . . . " 
    "Those people up there won't use atomics against us," Paul said. "They don't dare . . . and for the same reason that they cannot risk our destroying the source of the spice." 
    "But the injunction against --"
    "The injunction!" Paul barked. "It's fear, not the injunction that keeps the Houses from hurling atomics against each other. The language of the Great Convention is clear enough: 'Use of atomics against humans shall be cause for planetary obliteration.' We're going to blast the Shield Wall, not humans." 
    "It's too fine a point," Gurney said.
    "The hair-splitters up there will welcome any point," Paul said. "Let's talk no more about it."
    He turned away, wishing he actually felt that confident. Presently, he said: "What about the city people? Are they in position yet?" 
    "Yes," Stilgar muttered.
    Paul looked at him. "What's eating you?"
    "I never knew the city man could be trusted completely," Stilgar said.
    "I was a city man myself once," Paul said.
    Stilgar stiffened. His face grew dark with blood. "Muad'Dib knows I did not mean --"
    "I know what you meant, Stil. But the test of a man isn't what you think he'll do. It's what he actually does. These city people have Fremen blood. It's just that they haven't yet learned how to escape their bondage. We'll teach them."
    Stilgar nodded, spoke in a rueful tone: "The habits of a lifetime, Muad'Dib. On the Funeral Plain we learned to despise the men of the communities."
    Paul glanced at Gurney, saw him studying Stilgar. "Tell us, Gurney, why were the city folk down there driven from their homes by the Sardaukar?"
    "An old trick, my Duke. They thought to burden us with refugees."
    "It's been so long since guerrillas were effective that the mighty have forgotten how to fight them," Paul said. "The Sardaukar have played into our hands. They grabbed some city women for their sport, decorated their battle standards with the heads of the men who objected. And they've built up a fever of hate among people who otherwise would've looked on the coming battle as no more than a great inconvenience . . . and the possibility of exchanging one set of masters for another. The Sardaukar recruit for us, Stilgar." 
    "The city people do seem eager," Stilgar said.
    "Their hate is fresh and clear," Paul said. "That's why we use them as shock troops." 
    "The slaughter among them will be fearful," Gurney said. 
    Stilgar nodded agreement.
    "They were told the odds," Paul said. "They know every Sardaukar they kill will be one less for us. You see, gentlemen, they have something to die for. They've discovered they're a people. They're awakening."
    A muttered exclamation came from the watcher at the telescope. Paul moved to the rock slit, asked: "What is it out there?"
    "A great commotion, Muad'Dib," the watcher hissed. "At that monstrous metal tent. A surface car came from Rimwall West and it was like a hawk into a nest of rock partridge." 
    "Our captive Sardaukar have arrived," Paul said.
    "They've a shield around the entire landing field now," the watcher said. "I can see the air dancing even to the edge of the storage yard where they kept the spice."
    "Now they know who it is they fight," Gurney said. "Let the Harkonnen beasts tremble and fret themselves that an Atreides yet lives!"
    Paul spoke to the Fedaykin at the telescope. "Watch the flagpole atop the Emperor's ship. If my flag is raised there --" 
    "It will not be," Gurney said.
    Paul saw the puzzled frown on Stilgar's face, said: "If the Emperor recognized my claim, he'll signal by restoring the Atreides flag to Arrakis. We'll use the second plan then, move only against the Harkonnens. The Sardaukar will stand aside and let us settle the issue between ourselves."
    "I've no experience with these offworld things," Stilgar said. "I've heard of them, but it seems unlikely the --" 
    "You don't need experience to know what they'll do," Gurney said.
    "They're sending a new flag up on the tall ship," the watcher said. "The flag is yellow . . . with a black and red circle in the center."
    "There's a subtle piece of business," Paul said. "The CHOAM Company flag."
    "It's the same as the flag at the other ships," the Fedaykin guard said.
    "I don't understand," Stilgar said.
    "A subtle piece of business indeed," Gurney said. "Had he sent up the Atreides banner, he'd have had to live by what that meant. Too many observers about. He could've signaled with the Harkonnen flag on his staff -- a flat declaration that'd have been. But, no -- he sends up the CHOAM rag. He's telling the people up there . . . " Gurney pointed toward space. " . . . where the profit is. He's saying he doesn't care if it's an Atreides here or not." 
    "How long till the storm strikes the Shield Wall?" Paul asked.
    Stilgar turned away, consulted one of the Fedaykin in the bowl. Presently, he returned, said: "Very soon, Muad'Dib. Sooner than we expected. It's a great-great-grandmother of a storm . . . perhaps even more than you wished."
    "It's my storm," Paul said, and saw the silent awe on the faces of the Fedaykin who heard him. "Though it shook the entire world it could not be more than I wished. Will it strike the Shield Wall full on?" 
    "Close enough to make no difference," Stilgar said.
    A courier crossed from the hole that led down into the basin, said: "The Sardaukar and Harkonnen patrols are pulling back, Muad'Dib."
    "They expect the storm to spill too much sand into the basin for good visibility," Stilgar Said. "They think we'll be in the same fix."
    "Tell our gunners to set their sights well before visibility drops," Paul said. "They must knock the nose off every one of those ships as soon as the storm has destroyed the shields." He stepped to the wall of the bowl, pulled back a fold of the camouflage cover and looked up at the sky. The horsetail twistings of blow sand could be seen against the dark of the sky. Paul restored the cover, said: "Start sending our men down, Stil." 
    "Will you not go with us?" Stilgar asked. 
    "I'll wait here a bit with the Fedaykin," Paul said.
    Stilgar gave a knowing shrug toward Gurney, moved to the hole in the rock wall, was lost in its shadows.
    "The trigger that blasts the Shield Wall aside, that I leave in your hands, Gurney," Paul said. "You will do it?" 
    "I'll do it."
    Paul gestured to a Fedaykin lieutenant, said: "Otheym, start moving the check patrols out of the blast area. They must be out of there before the storm strikes." 
    The man bowed, followed Stilgar.
    Gurney leaned in to the rock slit, spoke to the man at the telescope: "Keep your attention on the south wall. It'll be completely undefended until we blow it."
    "Dispatch a cielago with a time signal," Paul ordered.
    "Some ground cars are moving toward the south wall," the man at the telescope said. "Some are using projectile weapons, testing. Our people are using body shields as you commanded. The ground cars have stopped."
    In the abrupt silence, Paul heard the wind devils playing overhead -- the front of the storm. Sand began to drift down into their bowl through gaps in the cover. A burst of wind caught the cover, whipped it away.
    Paul motioned his Fedaykin to take shelter, crossed to the men at the communications equipment near the tunnel mouth. Gurney stayed beside him. Paul crouched over the signalmen.
    One said: "A great-great-great grandmother of a storm, Muad'Dib."
    Paul glanced up at the darkening sky, said: "Gurney, have the south wall observers pulled out." He had to repeat his order, shouting above the growing noise of the storm. 
    Gurney turned to obey.
    Paul fastened his face filter, tightened the stillsuit hood. 
    Gurney returned.
    Paul touched his shoulder, pointed to the blast trigger set into the tunnel mouth beyond the signalmen. Gurney went into the tunnel, stopped there, one hand at the trigger, his gaze on Paul.
    "We are getting no messages," the signalman beside Paul said. "Much static."
    Paul nodded, kept his eye on the time-standard dial in front of the signalman. Presently, Paul looked at Gurney, raised a hand, returned his attention to the dial. The time counter crawled around its final circuit.
    "Now!" Paul shouted, and dropped his hand. 
    Gurney depressed the blast trigger.
    It seemed that a full second passed before they felt the ground beneath them ripple and shake. A rumbling sound was added to the storm's roar.
    The Fedaykin watcher from the telescope appeared beside Paul, the telescope clutched under one arm. "The Shield Wall is breached, Muad'Dib!" he shouted. "The storm is on them and our gunners already are firing."
    Paul thought of the storm sweeping across the basin, the static charge within the wall of sand that destroyed every shield barrier in the enemy camp.
    "The storm!" someone shouted. "We must get under cover, Muad'Dib!"
    Paul came to his senses, feeling the sand needles sting his exposed cheeks. We are committed, he thought. He put an arm around the signalman's shoulder, said: "Leave the equipment! There's more in the tunnel." He felt himself being pulled away, Fedaykin pressed around him to protect him. They squeezed into the tunnel mouth, feeling its comparative silence, turned a corner into a small chamber with glowglobes overhead and another tunnel opening beyond.
    Another signalman sat there at his equipment. 
    "Much static," the man said.
    A swirl of sand filled the air around them.
    "Seal off this tunnel!" Paul shouted. A sudden pressure of stillness showed that his command had been obeyed. "Is the way down to the basin still open?" Paul asked.
    A Fedaykin went to look, returned, said: "The explosion caused a little rock to fall, but the engineers say it is still open. They're cleaning up with lasbeams."
    "Tell them to use their hands!" Paul barked. "There are shields active down there?"
    "They are being careful, Muad'Dib," the man said, but he turned to obey.
    The signalmen from outside pressed past them carrying their equipment.
    "I told those men to leave their equipment!" Paul said.
    "Fremen do not like to abandon equipment, Muad'Dib," one of his Fedaykin chided.
    "Men are more important than equipment now," Paul said. "We'll have more equipment than we can use soon or have no need for any equipment."
    Gurney Halleck came up beside him, said: "I heard them say the way down is open. We're very close to the surface here, m'Lord, should the Harkonnens try to retaliate in kind."
    "They're in no position to retaliate," Paul said. "They're just now finding out that they have no shields and are unable to get off Arrakis."
    "The new command post is all prepared, though, m'Lord," Gurney said.
    "They've no need of me in the command post yet," Paul said. "The plan would go ahead without me. We must wait for the --" 
    "I'm getting a message, Muad'Dib," said the signalman at the communications equipment. The man shook his head, pressed a receiver phone against his ear. "Much static!" He began scribbling on a pad in front of him, shaking his head waiting, writing . . . waiting.
    Paul crossed to the signalman's side. The Fedaykin stepped back, giving him room. He looked down at what the man had written, read:
    "Raid . . . on Sietch Tabr . . . captives . . . Alia (blank) families of (blank) dead are . . . they (blank) son of Muad'Dib . . . " 
    Again, the signalman shook his head. 
    Paul looked up to see Gurney staring at him.
    "The message is garbled," Gurney said. "The static. You don't know that . . . "
    "My son is dead," Paul said, and knew as he spoke that it was true. "My son is dead . . . and Alia is a captive . . . hostage." He felt emptied, a shell without emotions. Everything he touched brought death and grief. And it was like a disease that could spread across the universe.
    He could feel the old-man wisdom, the accumulation out of the experiences from countless possible lives. Something seemed to chuckle and rub its hands within him.
    And Paul thought: How little the universe knows about the nature of real cruelty!

= = = = = =

And Muad'Dib stood before them, and he said: "Though we deem the captive dead, yet does she live. For her seed is my seed and her voice is my voice. And she sees unto the farthest reaches of possibility. Yea, unto the vale of the unknowable does she see because of me."
-from "Arrakis Awakening" by the Princess Irulan

    The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood with eyes downcast in the Imperial audience chamber, the oval selamlik within the Padishah Emperor's hutment. With covert glances, the Baron had studied the metal-walled room and its occupants -- the noukkers, the pages, the guards, the troop of House Sardaukar drawn up around the walls, standing at ease there beneath the bloody and tattered captured battle flags that were the room's only decoration.
    Voices sounded from the right of the chamber, echoing out of a high passage: "Make way! Make way for the Royal Person!" 
    The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV came out of the passage into the audience chamber followed by his suite. He stood waiting while his throne was brought, ignoring the Baron, seemingly ignoring every person in the room.
    The Baron found that he could not ignore the Royal Person, and studied the Emperor for a sign, any clue to the purpose of this audience. The Emperor stood poised, waiting -- a slim, elegant figure in a gray Sardaukar uniform with silver and gold trim. His thin face and cold eyes reminded the Baron of the Duke Leto long dead. There was that same look of the predatory bird. But the Emperor's hair was red, not black, and most of that hair was concealed by a Burseg's ebon helmet with the Imperial crest in gold upon its crown.
    Pages brought the throne. It was a massive chair carved from a single piece of Hagal quartz -- blue-green translucency shot through with streaks of yellow fire. They placed it on the dais and the Emperor mounted, seated himself.
    An old woman in a black aba robe with hood drawn down over her forehead detached herself from the Emperor's suite, took up station behind the throne, one scrawny hand resting on the quartz back. Her face peered out of the hood like a witch caricature -- sunken cheeks and eyes, an overlong nose, skin mottled and with protruding veins.
    The Baron stilled his trembling at sight of her. The presence of the Reverend Mother Gains Helen Mohiam, the Emperor's Truthsayer, betrayed the importance of this audience. The Baron looked away from her, studied the suite for a clue. There were two of the Guild agents, one tall and fat, one short and fat, both with bland gray eyes. And among the lackeys stood one of the Emperor's daughters, the Princess Irulan, a woman they said was being trained in the deepest of the Bene Gesserit ways, destined to be a Reverend Mother. She was tall, blonde, face of chiseled beauty, green eyes that looked past and through him. 
    "My dear Baron."
    The Emperor had deigned to notice him. The voice was baritone and with exquisite control. It managed to dismiss him while greeting him.
    The Baron bowed low, advanced to the required position ten paces from the dais. "I came at your summons, Majesty." 
    "Summons!" the old witch cackled.
    "Now, Reverend Mother," the Emperor chided, but he smiled at the Baron's discomfiture, said: "First, you will tell me where you've sent your minion, Thufir Hawat."
    The Baron darted his gaze left and right, reviled himself for coming here without his own guards, not that they'd be much use against Sardaukar. Still . . .
    "Well?" the Emperor said.
    "He has been gone these five days, Majesty." The Baron shot a glance at the Guild agents, back to the Emperor. "He was to land at a smuggler base and attempt infiltrating the camp of the Fremen fanatic, this Muad'Dib." 
    "Incredible!" the Emperor said.
    One of the witch's clawlike hands tapped the Emperor's shoulder. She leaned forward, whispered in his ear.
    The Emperor nodded, said: "Five days, Baron. Tell me, why aren't you worried about his absence?"
    "But I am worried, Majesty!"
    The Emperor continued to stare at him, waiting. The Reverend Mother emitted a cackling laugh.
    "What I mean, Majesty," the Baron said, "is that Hawat will be dead within another few hours, anyway." And he explained about the latent poison and need for an antidote.
    "How clever of you, Baron," the Emperor said. "And where are your nephews, Rabban and the young Feyd-Rautha?" 
    "The storm comes, Majesty. I sent them to inspect our perimeter lest the Fremen attack under cover of the sand."
    "Perimeter," the Emperor said. The word came out as though it puckered his mouth. "The storm won't be much here in the basin, and that Fremen rabble won't attack while I'm here with five legions of Sardaukar."
    "Surely not, Majesty," the Baron said, "But error on the side of caution cannot be censured."
    "Ah-h-h-h," the Emperor said. "Censure. Then I'm not to speak of how much time this Arrakis nonsense has taken from me? Nor the CHOAM Company profits pouring down this rat hole? Nor the court functions and affairs of state I've had to delay -- even cancel -- because of this stupid affair?"
    The Baron lowered his gaze, frightened by the Imperial anger. The delicacy of his position here, alone and dependent upon the Convention and the dictum familia of the Great Houses, fretted him. Does he mean to kill me? the Baron asked himself. He couldn't! Not with the other Great Houses waiting up there, aching for any excuse to gain from this upset on Arrakis. 
    "Have you taken hostages?" the Emperor asked.
    "It's useless, Majesty," the Baron said. "These mad Fremen hold a burial ceremony for every captive and act as though such a one were already dead." 
    "So?" the Emperor said.
    And the Baron waited, glancing left and right at the metal walls of the selamlik, thinking of the monstrous fanmetal tent around him. Such unlimited wealth it represented that even the Baron was awed. He brings pages, the Baron thought, and useless court lackeys, his women and their companions -- hair-dressers, designers, everything . . . all the fringe parasites of the Court. All here -- fawning, slyly plotting, "roughing it" with the Emperor . . . here to watch him put an end to this affair, to make epigrams over the battles and idolize the wounded.
    "Perhaps you've never sought the right kind of hostages," the Emperor said.
    He knows something, the Baron thought. Fear sat like a stone in his stomach until he could hardly bear the thought of eating. Yet, the feeling was like hunger, and he poised himself several times in his suspensors on the point of ordering food brought to him. But there was no one here to obey his summons.
    "Do you have any idea who this Muad'Dib could be?" the Emperor asked.
    "One of the Umma, surely," the Baron said. "A Fremen fanatic, a religious adventurer. They crop up regularly on the fringes of civilization. Your Majesty knows this."
    The Emperor glanced at his Truthsayer, turned back to scowl at the Baron. "And you have no other knowledge of this Muad'Dib?" 
    "A madman," the Baron said. "But all Fremen are a little mad." 
    "Mad?"
    "His people scream his name as they leap into battle. The women throw their babies at us and hurl themselves onto our knives to open a wedge for their men to attack us. They have no . . . no . . . decency!"
    "As bad as that," the Emperor murmured, and his tone of derision did not escape the Baron. "Tell me, my dear Baron, have you investigated the southern polar regions of Arrakis?" 
    The Baron stared up at the Emperor, shocked by the change of subject. "But . . . well, you know, Your Majesty, the entire region is uninhabitable, open to wind and worm. There's not even any spice in those latitudes."
    "You've had no reports from spice lighters that patches of greenery appear there?"
    "There've always been such reports. Some were investigated -- long ago. A few plants were seen. Many 'thopters were lost. Much too costly, Your Majesty. It's a place where men cannot survive for long."
    "So," the Emperor said. He snapped his fingers and a door opened at his left behind the throne. Through the door came two Sardaukar herding a girl-child who appeared to be about four years old. She wore a black aba, the hood thrown back to reveal the attachments of a stillsuit hanging free at her throat. Her eyes were Fremen blue, staring out of a soft, round face. She appeared completely unafraid and there was a look to her stare that made the Baron feel uneasy for no reason he could explain.
    Even the old Bene Gesserit Truthsayer drew back as the child passed and made a warding sign in her direction. The old witch obviously was shaken by the child's presence.
    The Emperor cleared his throat to speak, but the child spoke first -- a thin voice with traces of a soft-palate lisp, but clear nonetheless. "So here he is," she said. She advanced to the edge of the dais. "He doesn't appear much, does he -- one frightened old fat man too weak to support his own flesh without the help of suspensors."
    It was such a totally unexpected statement from the mouth of a child that the Baron stared at her, speechless in spite of his anger. Is it a midget? he asked himself.
    "My dear Baron," the Emperor said, "become acquainted with the sister of Muad'Dib."
    "The sist . . . "The Baron shifted his attention to the Emperor. "I do not understand."
    "I, too, sometimes err on the side of caution," the Emperor said. "It has been reported to me that your uninhabited south polar regions exhibit evidence of human activity."
    "But that's impossible!" the Baron protested. "The worms . . . there's sand clear to the . . . "
    "These people seem able to avoid the worms," the Emperor said.
    The child sat down on the dais beside the throne, dangled her feet over the edge, kicking them. There was such an air of sureness in the way she appraised her surroundings.
    The Baron stared at the kicking feet, the way they moved the black robe, the wink of sandals beneath the fabric.
    "Unfortunately," the Emperor said, "I only sent in five troop carriers with a light attack force to pick up prisoners for questioning. We barely got away with three prisoners and one carrier. Mind you, Baron, my Sardaukar were almost overwhelmed by a force composed mostly of women, children, and old men. This child here was in command of one of the attacking groups."
    "You see, Your Majesty!" the Baron said. "You see how they are!"
    "I allowed myself to be captured," the child said. "I did not want to face my brother and have to tell him that his son had been killed."
    "Only a handful of our men got away," the Emperor said. "Got away! You hear that?"
    "We'd have had them, too," the child said, "except for the flames."
    "My Sardaukar used the attitudinal jets on their carrier as flame-throwers," the Emperor said. "A move of desperation and the only thing that got them away with their three prisoners. Mark that, my dear Baron: Sardaukar forced to retreat in confusion from women and children and old men!"
    "We must attack in force," the Baron rasped. "We must destroy every last vestige of --"
    "Silence!" the Emperor roared. He pushed himself forward on his throne. "Do not abuse my intelligence any longer. You stand there in your foolish innocence and --" 
    "Majesty," the old Truthsayer said.
    He waved her to silence. "You say you don't know about the activity we found, nor the fighting qualities of these superb people!" The Emperor lifted himself half off his throne. "What do you take me for, Baron?"
    The Baron took two backward steps, thinking: It was Rabban. He has done this to me. Rabban has . . . 
    "And this fake dispute with Duke Leto," the Emperor purred, sinking back into his throne. "How beautifully you maneuvered it." 
    "Majesty," the Baron pleaded. "What are you --" 
    "Silence!"
    The old Bene Gesserit put a hand on the Emperor's shoulder, leaned close to whisper in his ear.
    The child seated on the dais stopped kicking her feet, said: "Make him afraid some more, Shaddam. I shouldn't enjoy this, but I find the pleasure impossible to suppress."
    "Quiet, child," the Emperor said. He leaned forward, put a hand on her head, stared at the Baron. "Is it possible, Baron? Could you be as simpleminded as my Truthsayer suggests? Do you not recognize this child, daughter of your ally, Duke Leto?" 
    "My father was never his ally," the child said. "My father is dead and this old Harkonnen beast has never seen me before." 
    The Baron was reduced to stupefied glaring. When he found his voice it was only to rasp: "Who?"
    "I am Alia, daughter of Duke Leto and the Lady Jessica, sister of Duke Paul-Muad'Dib," the child said. She pushed herself off the dais, dropped to the floor of the audience chamber. "My brother has promised to have your head atop his battle standard and I think he shall."
    "Be hush, child," the Emperor said, and he sank back into his throne, hand to chin, studying the Baron.
    "I do not take the Emperor's orders," Alia said. She turned, looked up at the old Reverend Mother. "She knows." 
    The Emperor glanced up at his Truthsayer. "What does she mean?"
    "That child is an abomination!" the old woman said. "Her mother deserves a punishment greater than anything in history. Death! It cannot come too quickly for that child or for the one who spawned her!" The old woman pointed a finger at Alia. "Get out of my mind!"
    "T-P?" the Emperor whispered. He snapped his attention back to Alia. "By the Great Mother!"
    "You don't understand. Majesty," the old woman said. "Not telepathy. She's in my mind. She's like the ones before me, the ones who gave me their memories. She stands in my mind! She cannot be there, but she is!"
    "What others?" the Emperor demanded. "What's this nonsense?"
    The old woman straightened, lowered her pointing hand. "I've said too much, but the fact remains that this child who is not a child must be destroyed. Long were we warned against such a one and how to prevent such a birth, but one of our own has betrayed us." 
    "You babble, old woman," Alia said. "You don't know how it was, yet you rattle on like a purblind fool." Alia closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and held it.
    The old Reverend Mother groaned and staggered.
    Alia opened her eyes. "That is how it was," she said. "A cosmic accident . . . and you played your part in it."
    The Reverend Mother held out both hands, palms pushing the air toward Alia.
    "What is happening here?" the Emperor demanded. "Child, can you truly project your thoughts into the mind of another?" 
    "That's not how it is at all," Alia said. "Unless I'm born as you, I cannot think as you."
    "Kill her," the old woman muttered, and clutched the back of the throne for support. "Kill her!" The sunken old eyes glared at Alia.
    "Silence," the Emperor said, and he studied Alia. "Child, can you communicate with your brother?" 
    "My brother knows I'm here," Alia said.
    "Can you tell him to surrender as the price of your life?" 
    Alia smiled up at him with clear innocence. "I shall not do that," she said.
    The Baron stumbled forward to stand beside Alia. "Majesty," he pleaded, "I knew nothing of --"
    "Interrupt me once more, Baron," the Emperor said, "and you will lose the powers of interruption . . . forever." He kept his attention focused on Alia, studying her through slitted lids. "You will not, eh? Can you read in my mind what I'll do if you disobey me?"
    "I've already said I cannot read minds," she said, "but one doesn't need telepathy to read your intentions."
    The Emperor scowled. "Child, your cause is hopeless. I have but to rally my forces and reduce this planet to --"
    "It's not that simple," Alia said. She looked at the two Guildsmen. "Ask them."
    "It is not wise to go against my desires," the Emperor said. "You should not deny me the least thing."
    "My brother comes now," Alia said. "Even an Emperor may tremble before Muad'Dib, for he has the strength of righteousness and heaven smiles upon him."
    The Emperor surged to his feet. "This play has gone far enough. I will take your brother and this planet and grind them to --" 
    The room rumbled and shook around them. There came a sudden cascade of sand behind the throne where the hutment was coupled to the Emperor's ship. The abrupt flicker-tightening of skin pressure told of a wide-area shield being activated. 
    "I told you," Alia said. "My brother comes." 
    The Emperor stood in front of his throne, right hand pressed to right ear, the servo-receiver there chattering its report on the situation. The Baron moved two steps behind Alia. Sardaukar were leaping to positions at the doors.
    "We will fall back into space and reform," the Emperor said. "Baron, my apologies. These madmen are attacking under cover of the storm. We will show them an Emperor's wrath, then." He pointed at Alia. "Give her body to the storm."
    As he spoke, Alia fled backward, feigning terror: "Let the storm have what it can take!" she screamed. And she backed into the Baron's arms.
    "I have her, Majesty!" the Baron shouted. "Shall I dispatch her now-eeeeeeeeeeeh!" He hurled her to the floor, clutched his left arm.
    "I'm sorry, Grandfather," Alia said. "You've met the Atreides gom jabbar." She got to her feet, dropped a dark needle from her hand.
    The Baron fell back. His eyes bulged as he stared at a red slash on his left palm. "You . . . you . . . " He rolled sideways in his suspensors, a sagging mass of flesh supported inches off the floor with head lolling and mouth hanging open.
    "These people are insane," the Emperor snarled. "Quick! Into the ship. We'll purge this planet of every . . . "
    Something sparkled to his left. A roll of ball lightning bounced away from the wall there, crackled as it touched the metal floor. The smell of burned insulation swept through the selamlik.
    "The shield!" one of the Sardaukar officers shouted. "The outer shield is down! They . . . "
    His words were drowned in a metallic roaring as the shipwall behind the Emperor trembled and rocked.
    "They've shot the nose off our ship!" someone called.
    Dust boiled through the room. Under its cover, Alia leaped up, ran toward the outer door.
    The Emperor whirled, motioned his people into an emergency door that swung open in the ship's side behind the throne. He flashed a hand signal to a Sardaukar officer leaping through the dust haze. "We will make our stand here!" the Emperor ordered.
    Another crash shook the hutment. The double doors banged open at the far side of the chamber admitting wind-blown sand and the sound of shouting. A small, black-robed figure could be seen momentarily against the light -- Alia darting out to find a knife and, as befitted her Fremen training, to kill Harkonnen and Sardaukar wounded. House Sardaukar charged through a greened yellow haze toward the opening, weapons ready, forming an arc there to protect the Emperor's retreat.
    "Save yourself, Sire!" a Sardaukar officer shouted. "Into the ship!"
    But the Emperor stood alone now on his dais pointing toward the doors. A forty-meter section of the hutment had been blasted away there and the selamlik's doors opened now onto drifting sand. A dust cloud hung low over the outside world blowing from pastel distances. Static lightning crackled from the cloud and the spark flashes of shields being shorted out by the storm's charge could be seen through the haze. The plain surged with figures in combat -- Sardaukar and leaping gyrating robed men who seemed to come down out of the storm.
    All this was as a frame for the target of the Emperor's pointing hand.
    Out of the sand haze came an orderly mass of flashing shapes -- great rising curves with crystal spokes that resolved into the gaping mouths of sandworms, a massed wall of them, each with troops of Fremen riding to the attack. They came in a hissing wedge, robes whipping in the wind as they cut through the melee on the plain.
    Onward toward the Emperor's hutment they came while the House Sardaukar stood awed for the first time in their history by an onslaught their minds found difficult to accept.
    But the figures leaping from the worm backs were men, and the blades flashing in that ominous yellow light were a thing the Sardaukar had been trained to face. They threw themselves into combat. And it was man to man on the plain of Arrakeen while a picked Sardaukar bodyguard pressed the Emperor back into the ship, sealed the door on him, and prepared to die at that door as part of his shield.
    In the shock of comparative silence within the ship, the Emperor stared at the wide-eyed faces of his suite, seeing his oldest daughter with the flush of exertion on her cheeks, the old Truthsayer standing like a black shadow with her hood pulled about her face, finding at last the faces he sought -- the two Guildsmen. They wore the Guild gray, unadorned, and it seemed to fit the calm they maintained despite the high emotions around them.
    The taller of the two, though, held a hand to his left eye. As the Emperor watched, someone jostled the Guildsman's arm, the hand moved, and the eye was revealed. The man had lost one of his masking contact lenses, and the eye stared out a total blue so dark as to be almost black.
    The smaller of the pair elbowed his way a step nearer the Emperor, said: "We cannot know how it will go." And the taller companion, hand restored to eye, added in a cold voice: "But this Muad'Dib cannot know, either."
    The words shocked the Emperor out of his daze. He checked the scorn on his tongue by a visible effort because it did not take a Guild navigator's single-minded focus on the main chance to see the immediate future out on that plain. Were these two so dependent upon their faculty that they had lost the use of their eyes and their reason? he wondered.
    "Reverend Mother," he said, "we must devise a plan." 
    She pulled the hood from her face, met his gaze with an unblinking stare. The look that passed between them carried complete understanding. They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.
    "Summon Count Fenring from his quarters," the Reverend Mother said.
    The Padishah Emperor nodded, waved for one of his aides to obey that command.

= = = = = =

He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring Muad'Dib's motives by ordinary standards. In the moment of his triumph, he saw the death prepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad'Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies' skins, the Muad'Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: "I am the Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough. "
-from "Arrakis Awakening" by the Princess Irulan

    It was to the Arrakeen governor's mansion, the old Residency the Atreides had first occupied on Dune, that they escorted Paul-Muad'Dib on the evening of his victory. The building stood as Rabban had restored it, virtually untouched by the fighting although there had been looting by townspeople. Some of the furnishings in the main hall had been overturned or smashed.
    Paul strode through the main entrance with Gurney Halleck and Stilgar a pace behind. Their escort fanned out into the Great Hall, straightening the place and clearing an area for Muad'Dib. One squad began investigating that no sly trap had been planted here.
    "I remember the day we first came here with your father," Gurney said. He glanced around at the beams and the high, slitted windows. "I didn't like this place then and I like it less now. One of our caves would be safer."
    "Spoken like a true Fremen," Stilgar said, and he marked the cold smile that his words brought to Muad'Dib's lips. "Will you reconsider, Muad'Dib?"
    "This place is a symbol," Paul said. "Rabban lived here. By occupying this place I seal my victory for all to understand. Send men through the building. Touch nothing. Just be certain no Harkonnen people or toys remain."
    "As you command," Stilgar said, and reluctance was heavy in his tone as he turned to obey.
    Communications men hurried into the room with their equipment, began setting up near the massive fireplace. The Fremen guard that augmented the surviving Fedaykin took up stations around the room. There was muttering among them, much darting of suspicious glances. This had been too long a place of the enemy for them to accept their presence in it casually.
    "Gurney, have an escort bring my mother and Chani," Paul said. "Does Chani know yet about our son?" 
    "The message was sent, m'Lord." 
    "Are the makers being taken out of the basin yet?" 
    "Yes, m'Lord. The storm's almost spent." 
    "What's the extent of the storm damage?" Paul asked.
    "In the direct path -- on the landing field and across the spice storage yards of the plain -- extensive damage," Gurney said. "As much from battle as from the storm." 
    "Nothing money won't repair, I presume," Paul said.
    "Except for the lives, m'Lord," Gurney said, and there was a tone of reproach in his voice as though to say: "When did an Atreides worry first about things when people were at stake?" 
    But Paul could only focus his attention on the inner eye and the gaps visible to him in the time-wall that still lay across his path. Through each gap the jihad raged away down the corridors of the future.
    He sighed, crossed the hall, seeing a chair against the wall. The chair had once stood in the dining hall and might even have held his own father. At the moment, though, it was only an object to rest his weariness and conceal it from the men. He sat down, pulling his robes around his legs, loosening his stillsuit at the neck.
    "The Emperor is still holed up in the remains of his ship," Gurney said.
    "For now, contain him there," Paul said. "Have they found the Harkonnens yet?" 
    "They're still examining the dead."
    "What reply from the ships up there?" He jerked his chin toward the ceiling.
    "No reply yet, m'Lord."
    Paul sighed, resting against the back of his chair. Presently, he said: "Bring me a captive Sardaukar. We must send a message to our Emperor, It's time to discuss terms." 
    "Yes, m'Lord."
    Gurney turned away, dropped a hand signal to one of the Fedaykin who took up close-guard position beside Paul.
    "Gurney," Paul whispered. "Since we've been rejoined I've yet to hear you produce the proper quotation for the event." He turned, saw Gurney swallow, saw the sudden grim hardening of the man's jaw.
    "As you wish, m'Lord," Gurney said. He cleared his throat, rasped: " 'And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.' "
    Paul closed his eyes, forcing grief out of his mind, letting it wait as he had once waited to mourn his father. Now, he gave his thoughts over to this day's accumulated discoveries -- the mixed futures and the hidden presence of Alia within his awareness.
    Of all the uses of time-vision, this was the strangest. "I have breasted the future to place my words where only you can hear them," Alia had said. "Even you cannot do that, my brother. I find it an interesting play. And . . . oh, yes -- I've killed our grandfather, the demented old Baron. He had very little pain." 
    Silence. His time sense had seen her withdrawal. 
    "Muad'Dib."
    Paul opened his eyes to see Stilgar's black-bearded visage above him, the dark eyes glaring with battle light.
    "You've found the body of the old Baron," Paul said.
    A hush of the person settled over Stilgar. "How could you know?" he whispered. "We just found the body in that great pile of metal the Emperor built."
    Paul ignored the question, seeing Gurney return accompanied by two Fremen who supported a captive Sardaukar.
    "Here's one of them, m'Lord," Gurney said. He signed to the guard to hold the captive five paces in front of Paul.
    The Sardaukar's eyes, Paul noted, carried a glazed expression of shock. A blue bruise stretched from the bridge of his nose to the corner of his mouth. He was of the blond, chisel-featured caste, the look that seemed synonymous with rank among the Sardaukar, yet there were no insignia on his torn uniform except the gold buttons with the Imperial crest and the tattered braid of his trousers. 
    "I think this one's an officer, m'Lord," Gurney said.
    Paul nodded, said: "I am the Duke Paul Atreides. Do you understand that, man?" 
    The Sardaukar stared at him unmoving.
    "Speak up," Paul said, "or your Emperor may die." 
    The man blinked, swallowed. 
    "Who am I?" Paul demanded.
    "You are the Duke Paul Atreides," the man husked.
    He seemed too submissive to Paul, but then the Sardaukar had never been prepared for such happenings as this day. They'd never known anything but victory which, Paul realized, could be a weakness in itself. He put that thought aside for later consideration in his own training program.
    "I have a message for you to carry to the Emperor," Paul said. And he couched his words in the ancient formula: "I, a Duke of a Great House, an Imperial Kinsman, give my word of bond under the Convention. If the Emperor and his people lay down their arms and come to me here I will guard their lives with my own." Paul held up his left hand with the ducal signet for the Sardaukar to see. "I swear it by this." 
    The man wet his lips with his tongue, glanced at Gurney.
    "Yes," Paul said. "Who but an Atreides could command the allegiance of Gurney Halleck." 
    "I will carry the message," the Sardaukar said.
    "Take him to our forward command post and send him in," Paul said.
    "Yes, m'Lord." Gurney motioned for the guard to obey, led them out.
    Paul turned back to Stilgar.
    "Chani and your mother have arrived," Stilgar said. "Chani has asked time to be alone with her grief. The Reverend Mother sought a moment in the weirding room; I know not why." 
    "My mother's sick with longing for a planet she may never see," Paul said. "Where water falls from the sky and plants grow so thickly you cannot walk between them." 
    "Water from the sky," Stilgar whispered.
    In that instant, Paul saw how Stilgar had been transformed from the Fremen naib to a creature of the Lisan al-Gaib, a receptacle for awe and obedience. It was a lessening of the man, and Paul felt the ghost-wind of the jihad in it.
    I have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.
    In a rush of loneliness, Paul glanced around the room, noting how proper and on-review his guards had become in his presence. He sensed the subtle, prideful competition among them -- each hoping for notice from Muad'Dib.
    Muad'Dib from whom all blessings flow, he thought, and it was the bitterest thought of his life. They sense that I must take the throne, he thought. But they cannot know I do it to prevent the jihad. 
    Stilgar cleared his throat, said: "Rabban, too, is dead." 
    Paul nodded.
    Guards to the right suddenly snapped aside, standing at attention to open an aisle for Jessica. She wore her black aba and walked with a hint of striding across sand, but Paul noted how this house had restored to her something of what she had once been here -- concubine to a ruling duke. Her presence carried some of its old assertiveness.
    Jessica stopped in front of Paul, looked down at him. She saw his fatigue and how he hid it, but found no compassion for him. It was as though she had been rendered incapable of any emotion for her son.
    Jessica had entered the Great Hall wondering why the place refused to fit itself snugly in to her memories. It remained a foreign room, as though she had never walked here, never walked here with her beloved Leto, never confronted a drunken Duncan Idaho here -- never, never, never . . . 
    There should be a word-tension directly opposite to adab, the demanding memory, she thought. There should be a word for memories that deny themselves. 
    "Where is Alia?" she asked.
    "Out doing what any good Fremen child should be doing in such times," Paul said. "She's killing enemy wounded and marking their bodies for the water-recovery teams." 
    "Paul!"
    "You must understand that she does this out of kindness," he said. "Isn't it odd how we misunderstand the hidden unity of kindness and cruelty?"
    Jessica glared at her son, shocked by the profound change in him. Was it his child's death did this? she wondered. And she said: "The men tell strange stories of you, Paul. They say you've all the powers of the legend -- nothing can be hidden from you, that you see where others cannot see." 
    "A Bene Gesserit should ask about legends?" he asked.
    "I've had a hand in whatever you are," she admitted, "but you mustn't expect me to --"
    "How would you like to live billions upon billions of lives?" Paul asked. "There's a fabric of legends for you! Think of all those experiences, the wisdom they'd bring. But wisdom tempers love, doesn't it? And it puts a new shape on hate. How can you tell what's ruthless unless you've plumbed the depths of both cruelty and kindness? You should fear me, Mother. I am the Kwisatz Haderach."
    Jessica tried to swallow in a dry throat. Presently, she said; "Once you denied to me that you were the Kwisatz Haderach." 
    Paul shook his head. "I can deny nothing any more." He looked up into her eyes. "The Emperor and his people come now. They will be announced any moment. Stand beside me. I wish a clear view of them. My future bride will be among them." 
    "Paul!" Jessica snapped. "Don't make the mistake your father made!"
    "She's a princess," Paul said. "She's my key to the throne, and that's all she'll ever be. Mistake? You think because I'm what you made me that I cannot feel the need for revenge?" 
    "Even on the innocent?" she asked, and she thought: He must not make the mistakes I made.
    "There are no innocent any more," Paul said.
    "Tell that to Chani," Jessica said, and gestured toward the passage from the rear of the Residency.
    Chani entered the Great Hall there, walking between the Fremen guards as though unaware of them. Her hood and stillsuit cap were thrown back, face mask fastened aside. She walked with a fragile uncertainty as she crossed the room to stand beside Jessica.
    Paul saw the marks of tears on her cheeks -- She gives water to the dead. He felt a pang of grief strike through him, but it was as though he could only feel this thing through Chani's presence. 
    "He is dead, beloved," Chani said. "Our son is dead." 
    Holding himself under stiff control, Paul got to his feet. He reached out, touched Chani's cheek, feeling the dampness of her tears. "He cannot be replaced," Paul said, "but there will be other sons. It is Usul who promises this." Gently, he moved her aside, gestured to Stilgar.
    "Muad'Dib," Stilgar said.
    "They come from the ship, the Emperor and his people," Paul said. "I will stand here. Assemble the captives in an open space in, the center of the room. They will be kept at a distance of ten meters from me unless I command otherwise." 
    "As you command, Muad'Dib."
    As Stilgar turned to obey, Paul heard the awed muttering of Fremen guards: "You see? He knew! No one told him, but he knew!"
    The Emperor's entourage could be heard approaching now, his Sardaukar humming one of their marching tunes to keep up their spirits. There came a murmur of voices at the entrance and Gurney Halleck passed through the guard, crossed to confer with Stilgar, then moved to Paul's side, a strange look in His eyes.
    Will I lose Gurney, too? Paul wondered. The way I lost Stilgar -- losing a friend to gain a creature?
    "They have no throwing weapons," Gurney said. "I've made sure of that myself." He glanced around the room, seeing Paul's preparations. "Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is with them. Shall I cut him out?" 
    "Leave him."
    "There're some Guild people, too, demanding special privileges, threatening an embargo against Arrakis. I told them I'd give you their message." 
    "Let them threaten."
    "Paul!" Jessica hissed behind him. "He's talking about the Guild!" 
    "I'll pull their fangs presently," Paul said.
    And he thought then about the Guild -- the force that had specialized for so long that it had become a parasite, unable to exist independently of the life upon which it fed. They had never dared grasp the sword . . . and now they could not grasp it. They might have taken Arrakis when they realized the error of specializing on the melange awareness-spectrum narcotic for their navigators. They could have done this, lived their glorious day and died. Instead, they'd existed from moment to moment, hoping the seas in which they swam might produce a new host when the old one died.
    The Guild navigators, gifted with limited prescience, had made the fatal decision: they'd chosen always the clear, safe course that leads ever downward into stagnation.
    Let them look closely at their new host, Paul thought.
    "There's also a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who says she's a friend of your mother," Gurney said. 
    "My mother has no Bene Gesserit friends."
    Again, Gurney glanced around the Great Hall, then bent close to Paul's ear. "Thufir Hawat's with 'em, m'Lord. I had no chance to see him alone, but he used our old hand signs to say he's been working with the Harkonnens, thought you were dead. Says he's to be left among 'em." 
    "You left Thufir among those --"
    "He wanted it . . . and I thought it best. If . . . there's something wrong, he's where we can control him. If not -- we've an ear on the other side."
    Paul thought then of prescient glimpses into the possibilities of this moment -- and one time-line where Thufir carried a poisoned needle which the Emperor commanded he use against "this upstart Duke."
    The entrance guards stepped aside, formed a short corridor of lances. There came a murmurous swish of garments, feet rasping the sand that had drifted into the Residency.
    The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV led his people into the hall. His burseg helmet had been lost and the red hair stood out in disarray. His uniform's left sleeve had been ripped along the inner seam. He was beltless and without weapons, but his presence moved with him like a force-shield bubble that kept his immediate area open.
    A Fremen lance dropped across his path, stopped him where Paul had ordered. The others bunched up behind, a montage of color, of shuffling and of staring faces.
    Paul swept his gaze across the group, saw women who hid signs of weeping, saw the lackeys who had come to enjoy grandstand seats at a Sardaukar victory and now stood choked to silence by defeat. Paul saw the bird-bright eyes of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam glaring beneath her black hood, and beside her the narrow furtiveness of Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen. 
    There's a face time betrayed to me, Paul thought.
    He looked beyond Feyd-Rautha then, attracted by a movement, seeing there a narrow, weaselish face he'd never before encountered -- not in time or out of it. It was a face he felt he should know and the feeling carried with it a marker of fear. 
    Why should I fear that man? he wondered.
    He leaned toward his mother, whispered: "That man to the left of the Reverend Mother, the evil-looking one -- who is that?" 
    Jessica looked, recognizing the face from her Duke's dossiers. "Count Fenring," she said. "The one who was here immediately before us. A genetic-eunuch . . . and a killer."
    The Emperor's errand boy, Paul thought. And the thought was a shock crashing across his consciousness because he had seen the Emperor in uncounted associations spread through the possible futures--but never once had Count Fenring appeared within those prescient visions.
    It occurred to Paul then that he had seen his own dead body along countless reaches of the time web, but never once had he seen his moment of death.
    Have I been denied a glimpse of this man because he is the one who kills me? Paul wondered.
    The thought sent a pang of foreboding through him. He forced his attention away from Fenring, looked now at the remnants of Sardaukar men and officers, the bitterness on their faces and the desperation. Here and there among them, faces caught Paul's attention briefly: Sardaukar officers measuring the preparations within this room, planning and scheming yet for a way to turn defeat into victory.
    Paul's attention came at last to a tall blonde woman, green-eyed, a face of patrician beauty, classic in its hauteur, untouched by tears, completely undefeated. Without being told it, Paul knew her -- Princess Royal, Bene Gesserit -- trained, a face that time vision had shown him in many aspects: Irulan. 
    There's my key, he thought.
    Then he saw movement in the clustered people, a face and figure emerged -- Thufir Hawat, the seamed old features with darkly stained lips, the hunched shoulders, the look of fragile age about him.
    "There's Thufir Hawat," Paul said. "Let him stand free, Gurney." 
    "M'Lord," Gurney said.
    "Let him stand free," Paul repeated. 
    Gurney nodded.
    Hawat shambled forward as a Fremen lance was lifted and replaced behind him. The rheumy eyes peered at Paul, measuring, seeking.
    Paul stepped forward one pace, sensed the tense, waiting movement of the Emperor and his people.
    Hawat's gaze stabbed past Paul, and the old man said: "Lady Jessica, I but learned this day how I've wronged you in my thoughts. You needn't forgive." 
    Paul waited, but his mother remained silent.
    "Thufir, old friend," Paul said, "as you can see, my back is toward no door." 
    "The universe is full of doors," Hawat said. 
    "Am I my father's son?" Paul asked.
    "More like your grandfather's," Hawat rasped. "You've his manner and the look of him in your eyes."
    "Yet I'm my father's son," Paul said. "For I say to you, Thufir, that in payment for your years of service to my family you may now ask anything you wish of me. Anything at all. Do you need my life now, Thufir? It is yours." Paul stepped forward a pace, hands at his side, seeing the look of awareness grow in Hawat's eyes. 
    He realizes that I know of the treachery, Paul thought.
    Pitching his voice to carry in a half-whisper for Hawat's ears alone, Paul said: "I mean this, Thufir. If you're to strike me, do it now."
    "I but wanted to stand before you once more, my Duke," Hawat said. And Paul became aware for the first time of the effort the old man exerted to keep from falling. Paul reached out, supported Hawat by the shoulders, feeling the muscle tremors beneath his hands.
    "Is there pain, old friend?" Paul asked.
    "There is pain, my Duke," Hawat agreed, "but the pleasure is greater." He half turned in Paul's arms, extended his left hand, palm up, toward the Emperor, exposing the tiny needle cupped against the fingers. "See, Majesty?" he called. "See your traitor's needle? Did you think that I who've given my life to service of the Atreides would give them less now?"
    Paul staggered as the old man sagged in his arms, felt the death there, the utter flaccidity. Gently, Paul lowered Hawat to the floor, straightened and signed for guardsmen to carry the body away.
    Silence held the hall while his command was obeyed.
    A look of deadly waiting held the Emperor's face now. Eyes that had never admitted fear admitted it at last.
    "Majesty," Paul said, and noted the jerk of surprised attention in the tall Princess Royal. The words had been uttered with the Bene Gesserit controlled atonals, carrying in it every shade of contempt and scorn that Paul could put there. 
    Bene-Gesserit trained indeed, Paul thought.
    The Emperor cleared his throat, said: "Perhaps my respected kinsman believes he has things all his own way now. Nothing could be more remote from fact. You have violated the Convention, used atomics against --"
    "I used atomics against a natural feature of the desert," Paul said. "It was in my way and I was in a hurry to get to you, Majesty, to ask your explanation for some of your strange activities." 
    "There's a massed armada of the Great Houses in space over Arrakis right now," the Emperor said. "I've but to say the word and they'll --"
    "Oh, yes," Paul said, "I almost forgot about them." He searched through the Emperor's suite until he saw the faces of the two Guildsmen, spoke aside to Gurney. "Are those the Guild agents, Gurney, the two fat ones dressed in gray over there?" 
    "Yes, m'Lord."
    "You two," Paul said, pointing. "Get out of there immediately and dispatch messages that will get that fleet on its way home. After this, you'll ask my permission before --"
    "The Guild doesn't take your orders!" the taller of the two barked. He and his companion pushed through to the barrier lances, which were raised at a nod from Paul. The two men stepped out and the taller leveled an arm at Paul, said: "You may very well be under embargo for your --"
    "If I hear any more nonsense from either of you," Paul said, "I'll give the order that'll destroy all spice production on Arrakis . . . forever."
    "Are you mad?" the tall Guildsman demanded. He fell back half a step.
    "You grant that I have the power to do this thing, then?" Paul asked.
    The Guildsman seemed to stare into space for a moment, then: "Yes, you could do it, but you must not."
    "Ah-h-h," Paul said and nodded to himself. "Guild navigators, both of you, eh?" 
    "Yes!"
    The shorter of the pair said: "You would blind yourself, too, and condemn us all to slow death. Have you any idea what it means to be deprived of the spice liquor once you're addicted?" 
    "The eye that looks ahead to the safe course is closed forever," Paul said. "The Guild is crippled. Humans become little isolated clusters on their isolated planets. You know, I might do this thing out of pure spite . . . or out of ennui."
    "Let us talk this over privately," the taller Guildsman said. "I'm sure we can come to some compromise that is --" 
    "Send the message to your people over Arrakis," Paul said. "I grow tired of this argument. If that fleet over us doesn't leave soon there'll be no need for us to talk." He nodded toward his communications men at the side of the hall. "You may use our equipment."
    "First we must discuss this," the tall Guildsman said. "We cannot just --"
    "Do it!" Paul barked. "The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it. You've agreed I have that power. We are not here to discuss or to negotiate or to compromise. You will obey my orders or suffer the immediate consequences!" 
    "He means it," the shorter Guildsman said. And Paul saw the fear grip them.
    Slowly the two crossed to the Fremen communications equipment.
    "Will they obey?" Gurney asked.
    "They have a narrow vision of time," Paul said. "They can see ahead to a blank wall marking the consequences of disobedience. Every Guild navigator on every ship over us can look ahead to that same wall. They'll obey."
    Paul turned back to look at the Emperor, said: "When they permitted you to mount your father's throne, it was only on the assurance that you'd keep the spice flowing. You've failed them, Majesty. Do you know the consequences?" 
    "Nobody permitted me to --"
    "Stop playing the fool," Paul barked. "The Guild is like a village beside a river. They need the water, but can only dip out what they require. They cannot dam the river and control it, because that focuses attention on what they take, it brings down eventual destruction. The spice flow, that's their river, and I have built a dam. But my dam is such that you cannot destroy it without destroying the river."
    The Emperor brushed a hand through his red hair, glanced at the backs of the two Guildsmen.
    "Even your Bene Gesserit Truthsayer is trembling," Paul said. "There are other poisons the Reverend Mothers can use for their tricks, but once they've used the spice liquor, the others no longer work."
    The old woman pulled her shapeless black robes around her, pressed forward out of the crowd to stand at the barrier lances.
    "Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam," Paul said. "It has been a long time since Caladan, hasn't it?"
    She looked past him at his mother, said: "Well, Jessica, I see that your son is indeed the one. For that you can be forgiven even the abomination of your daughter."
    Paul stilled a cold, piercing anger, said: "You've never had the right or cause to forgive my mother anything!" 
    The old woman locked eyes with him.
    "Try your tricks on me, old witch," Paul said. "Where's your gom jabbar? Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You'll find me there staring out at you!" 
    The old woman dropped her gaze. 
    "Have you nothing to say?" Paul demanded.
    "I welcomed you to the ranks of humans," she muttered. "Don't besmirch that."
    Paul raised his voice: "Observe her, comrades! This is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, patient in a patient cause. She could wait with her sisters -- ninety generations for the proper combination of genes and environment to produce the one person their schemes required. Observe her! She knows now that the ninety generations have produced that person. Here I stand . . . but . . . I . . . will . . . never . . . do . . . her . . . bidding!" 
    "Jessica!" the old woman screamed. "Silence him!"
    "Silence him yourself," Jessica said.
    Paul glared at the old woman. "For your part in all this I could gladly have you strangled," he said. "You couldn't prevent it!" he snapped as she stiffened in rage. "But I think it better punishment that you live out your years never able to touch me or bend me to a single thing your scheming desires." 
    "Jessica, what have you done?" the old woman demanded.
    "I'll give you only one thing," Paul said. "You saw part of what the race needs, but how poorly you saw it. You think to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to your master plan! How little you understand of what --" 
    "You mustn't speak of these things!" the old woman hissed.
    "Silence!" Paul roared. The word seemed to take substance as it twisted through the air between them under Paul's control.
    The old woman reeled back into the arms of those behind her, face blank with shock at the power with which he had seized her psyche. "Jessica, "she whispered. "Jessica."
    "I remember your gom jabbar," Paul said. "You remember mine. I can kill you with a word."
    The Fremen around the ball glanced knowingly at each other. Did the legend not say: "And his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against righteousness."
    Paul turned his attention to the tall Princess Royal standing beside her Emperor father. Keeping his eyes focused on her, he said: "Majesty, we both know the way out of our difficulty." 
    The Emperor glanced at his daughter, back to Paul. "You dare? You! An adventurer without family, a nobody from --" 
    "You've already admitted who I am," Paul said. "Royal kinsman, you said. Let's stop this nonsense."
    "I am your ruler," the Emperor said.
    Paul glanced at the Guildsmen standing now at the communications equipment and facing him. One of them nodded. 
    "I could force it," Paul said.
    "You will not dare!" the Emperor grated. 
    Paul merely stared at him.
    The Princess Royal put a hand on her father's arm. "Father," she said, and her voice was silky soft, soothing.
    "Don't try your tricks on me," the Emperor said. He looked at her. "You don't need to do this, Daughter. We've other resources that --" 
    "But here's a man fit to be your son," she said.
    The old Reverend Mother, her composure regained, forced her way to the Emperor's side, leaned close to his ear and whispered.
    "She pleads your case," Jessica said.
    Paul continued to look at the golden-haired Princess. Aside to his mother, he said: "That's Irulan, the oldest, isn't it?" 
    "Yes."
    Chani moved up on Paul's other side, said: "Do you wish me to leave, Muad'Dib?" 
    He glanced at her. "Leave? You'll never again leave my side." 
    "There's nothing binding between us," Chani said.
    Paul looked down at her for a silent moment, then: "Speak only truth with me, my Sihaya." As she started to reply, he silenced her with a finger to her lips. "That which binds us cannot be loosed," he said. "Now, watch these matters closely for I wish to see this room later through your wisdom."
    The Emperor and his Truthsayer were carrying on a heated, low-voiced argument.
    Paul spoke to his mother: "She reminds him that it's part of their agreement to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne, and Irulan is the one they've groomed for it." 
    "Was that their plan?" Jessica said. 
    "Isn't it obvious?" Paul asked.
    "I see the signs!" Jessica snapped. "My question was meant to remind you that you should not try to teach me those matters in which I instructed you." 
    Paul glanced at her, caught a cold smile on her lips.
    Gurney Halleck leaned between them, said: "I remind you, m'Lord, that there's a Harkonnen in that bunch." He nodded toward the dark-haired Feyd-Rautha pressed against a barrier lance on the left. "The one with the squinting eyes there on the left. As evil a face as I ever say. You promised me once that --" 
    "Thank you, Gurney," Paul said.
    "It's the na-Baron . . . Baron now that the old man's dead," Gurney said. "He'll do for what I've in --" 
    "Can you take him, Gurney?" "M'Lord jests!"
    "That argument between the Emperor and his witch has gone on long enough, don't you think, Mother?" 
    She nodded. "Indeed."
    Paul raised his voice, called out to the Emperor: "Majesty, is there a Harkonnen among you?"
    Royal disdain revealed itself in the way the Emperor turned to look at Paul. "I believe my entourage has been placed under the protection of your ducal word," he said.
    "My question was for information only," Paul said. "I wish to know if a Harkonnen is officially a part of your entourage or if a Harkonnen is merely hiding behind a technicality out of cowardice."
    The Emperor's smile was calculating. "Anyone accepted into the Imperial company is a member of my entourage." 
    "You have the word of a Duke," Paul said, "but Muad'Dib is another matter. He may not recognize your definition of what constitutes an entourage. My friend Gurney Halleck wishes to kill a Harkonnen. If he --"
    "Kanly!" Feyd-Rautha shouted. He pressed against the barrier lance. "Your father named this vendetta, Atreides. You call me coward while you hide among your women and offer to send a lackey against me!"
    The old Truthsayer whispered something fiercely into the Emperor's ear, but he pushed her aside, said: "Kanly, is it? There are strict rules for kanly." 
    "Paul, put a stop to this," Jessica said.
    "M'Lord," Gurney said, "You promised me my day against the Harkonnens."
    "You've had your day against them," Paul said and he felt a harlequin abandon take over his emotions. He slipped his robe and hood from his shoulders, handed them to his mother with his belt and crysknife, began unstrapping his stillsuit. He sensed now that the universe focused on this moment.
    "There's no need for this," Jessica said. "There are easier ways, Paul."
    Paul stepped out of his stillsuit, slipped the crysknife from its sheath in his mother's hand. "I know," he said. "Poison, an assassin, all the old familiar ways."
    "You promised me a Harkonnen!" Gurney hissed, and Paul marked the rage in the man's face, the way the inkvine scar stood out dark and ridged. "You owe it to me, m'Lord!" 
    "Have you suffered more from them than I?" Paul asked. 
    "My sister," Gurney rasped. "My years in the slave pits --"
    "My father," Paul said. "My good friends and companions, Thufir Hawat and Duncan Idaho, my years as a fugitive without rank or succor . . . and one more thing: it is now kanly and you know as well as I the rules that must prevail."
    Halleck's shoulders sagged. "M'Lord, if that swine . . . he's no more than a beast you'd spurn with your foot and discard the shoe because it'd been contaminated. Call in an executioner, if you must, or let me do it, but don't offer yourself to --"
    "Muad'Dib need not do this thing," Chani said.
    He glanced at her, saw the fear for him in her eyes. "But the Duke Paul must," he said.
    "This is a Harkonnen animal!" Gurney rasped.
    Paul hesitated on the point of revealing his own Harkonnen ancestry, stopped at a sharp look from his mother, said merely: "But this being has human shape, Gurney, and deserves human doubt." 
    Gurney said: "If he so much as --"
    "Please stand aside," Paul said. He hefted the crysknife, pushed Gurney gently aside.
    "Gurney!" Jessica said. She touched Gurney's arm. "He's like his grandfather in this mood. Don't distract him. It's the only thing you can do for him now." And she thought: Great Mother! What irony.
    The Emperor was studying Feyd-Rautha, seeing the heavy shoulders, the thick muscles. He turned to look at Paul -- a stringy whipcord of a youth, not as desiccated as the Arrakeen natives, but with ribs there to count, and sunken in the flanks so that the ripple and gather of muscles could be followed under the skin.
    Jessica leaned close to Paul, pitched her voice for his ears alone: "One thing, Son. Sometimes a dangerous person is prepared by the Bene Gesserit, a word implanted into the deepest recesses by the old pleasure-pain methods. The word-sound most frequently used is Uroshnor. If this one's been prepared, as I strongly suspect, that word uttered in his ear will render his muscles flaccid and --" 
    "I want no special advantage for this one," Paul said. "Step back out of my way."
    Gurney spoke to her: "Why is he doing this? Does he think to get himself killed and achieve martyrdom? This Fremen religious prattle, is that what clouds his reason?"
    Jessica hid her face in her hands, realizing that she did not know fully why Paul took this course. She could feel death in the room and knew that the changed Paul was capable of such a thing as Gurney suggested. Every talent within her focused on the need to protect her son, but there was nothing she could do. 
    "Is it this religious prattle?" Gurney insisted. 
    "Be silent," Jessica whispered. "And pray."
    The Emperor's face was touched by an abrupt smile. "If Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen . . . of my entourage . . . so wishes," he said, "I relieve him of all restraint and give him freedom to choose his own course in this." The Emperor waved a hand toward Paul's Fedaykin guards. "One of your rabble has my belt and short blade. If Feyd-Rautha wishes it, he may meet you with my blade in his hand."
    "I wish it," Feyd-Rautha said, and Paul saw the elation on the man's face.
    He's overconfident, Paul thought. There's a natural advantage I can accept.
    "Get the Emperor's blade," Paul said, and watched as his command was obeyed. "Put it on the floor there." He indicated a place with his foot. "Clear the Imperial rabble back against the wall and let the Harkonnen stand clear."
    A flurry of robes, scraping of feet, low-voiced commands and protests accompanied obedience to Paul's command. The Guildsmen remained standing near the communications equipment. They frowned at Paul in obvious indecision.
    They're accustomed to seeing the future, Paul thought. In this place and time they're blind . . . even as I am. And he sampled the time-winds, sensing the turmoil, the storm nexus that now focused on this moment place. Even the faint gaps were closed now. Here was the unborn jihad, he knew. Here was the race consciousness that he had known once as his own terrible purpose. Here was reason enough for a Kwisatz Haderach or a Lisan al-Gaib or even the halting schemes of the Bene Gesserit. The race of humans had felt its own dormancy, sensed itself grown stale and knew now only the need to experience turmoil in which the genes would mingle and the strong new mixtures survive. All humans were alive as an unconscious single organism in this moment, experiencing a kind of sexual heat that could override any barrier.
    And Paul saw how futile were any efforts of his to change any smallest bit of this. He had thought to oppose the jihad within himself, but the jihad would be. His legions would rage out from Arrakis even without him. They needed only the legend he already had become. He had shown them the way, given them mastery even over the Guild which must have the spice to exist.
    A sense of failure pervaded him, and he saw through it that Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen had slipped out of the torn uniform, stripped down to a fighting girdle with a mail core.
    This is the climax, Paul thought. From here, the future will open, the clouds part onto a kind of glory. And if I die here, they'll say I sacrificed myself that my spirit might lead them. And if I live, they'll say nothing can oppose Muad'Dib.
    "Is the Atreides ready?" Feyd-Rautha called, using the words of the ancient kanly ritual.
    Paul chose to answer him in the Fremen way: "May thy knife chip and shatter!" He pointed to the Emperor's blade on the floor, indicating that Feyd-Rautha should advance and take it.
    Keeping his attention on Paul, Feyd-Rautha picked up the knife, balancing it a moment in his hand to get the feel of it. Excitement kindled in him. This was a fight he had dreamed about -- man against man, skill against skill with no shields intervening. He could see a way to power opening before him because the Emperor surely would reward whoever killed this troublesome duke. The reward might even be that haughty daughter and a share of the throne. And this yokel duke, this back-world adventurer could not possibly be a match for a Harkonnen trained in every device and every treachery by a thousand arena combats. And the yokel had no way of knowing he faced more weapons than a knife here.
    Let us see if you're proof against poison! Feyd-Rautha thought. He saluted Paul with the Emperor's blade, said: "Meet your death, fool."
    "Shall we fight, cousin?" Paul asked. And he cat-footed forward, eyes on the waiting blade, his body crouched low with his own milk-white crysknife pointing out as though an extension of his arm.
    They circled each other, bare feet grating on the floor, watching with eyes intent for the slightest opening. 
    "How beautifully you dance," Feyd-Rautha said.
    He's a talker, Paul thought. There's another weakness. He grows uneasy in the face of silence.
    "Have you been shriven?" Feyd-Rautha asked. 
    Still, Paul circled in silence.
    And the old Reverend Mother, watching the fight from the press of the Emperor's suite, felt herself trembling. The Atreides youth had called the Harkonnen cousin. It could only mean he knew the ancestry they shared, easy to understand because he was the Kwisatz Haderach. But the words forced her to focus on the only thing that mattered to her here.
    This could be a major catastrophe for the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme.
    She had seen something of what Paul had seen here, that Feyd-Rautha might kill but not be victorious. Another thought, though, almost overwhelmed her. Two end products of this long and costly program faced each other in a fight to the death that might easily claim both of them. If both died here that would leave only Feyd-Rautha's bastard daughter, still a baby, an unknown, an unmeasured factor, and Alia, the abomination.
    "Perhaps you have only pagan rites here," Feyd-Rautha said. "Would you like the Emperor's Truthsayer to prepare your spirit for its journey?"
    Paul smiled, circling to the right, alert, his black thoughts suppressed by the needs of the moment.
    Feyd-Rautha leaped, feinting with right hand, but with the knife shifted in a blur to his left hand.
    Paul dodged easily, noting the shield-conditioned hesitation in Feyd-Rautha's thrust. Still, it was not as great a shield conditioning as some Paul had seen, and he sensed that Feyd-Rautha had fought before against unshielded foes.
    "Does an Atreides run or stand and fight?" Feyd-Rautha asked.
    Paul resumed his silent circling. Idaho's words came back to him, the words of training from the long-ago practice floor on Caladan: "Use the first moments in study. You may miss many an opportunity for quick victory this way, but the moments of study are insurance of success. Take your time and be sure."
    "Perhaps you think this dance prolongs your life a few moments," Feyd-Rautha said. "Well and good." He stopped the circling, straightened.
    Paul had seen enough for a first approximation. Feyd-Rautha led to the left side, presenting the right hip as though the mailed fighting girdle could protect his entire side. It was the action of a man trained to the shield and with a knife in both hands.
    Or . . . And Paul hesitated . . . the girdle was more than it seemed.
    The Harkonnen appeared too confident against a man who'd this day led the forces of victory against Sardaukar legions.
    Feyd-Rautha noted the hesitation, said: "Why prolong the inevitable? You but keep me from exercising my rights over this ball of dirt."
    If it's a flip-dart, Paul thought, it's a cunning one. The girdle shows no signs of tampering.
    "Why don't you speak?" Feyd-Rautha demanded.
    Paul resumed his probing circle, allowing himself a cold smile at the tone of unease in Feyd-Rautha's voice, evidence that the pressure of silence was building.
    "You smile, eh?" Feyd-Rautha asked. And he leaped in mid-sentence.
    Expecting the slight hesitation, Paul almost failed to evade the downflash of blade, felt its tip scratch his left arm. He silenced the sudden pain there, his mind flooded with realization that the earlier hesitation had been a trick -- an overfeint. Here was more of an opponent than he had expected. There would be tricks within tricks within tricks.
    "Your own Thufir Hawat taught me some of my skills," Feyd-Rautha said. "He gave me first blood. Too bad the old fool didn't live to see it."
    And Paul recalled that Idaho had once said, "Expect only what happens in the fight. That way you'll never be surprised." 
    Again the two circled each other, crouched, cautious.
    Paul saw the return of elation to his opponent, wondered at it. Did a scratch signify that much to the man? Unless there were poison on the blade! But how could there be? His own men had handled the weapon, snooped it before passing it. They were too well trained to miss an obvious thing like that.
    "That woman you were talking to over there," Feyd-Rautha said. "The little one. Is she something special to you? A pet perhaps? Will she deserve my special attentions?" 
    Paul remained silent, probing with his inner senses, examining the blood from the wound, finding a trace of soporific from the Emperor's blade. He realigned his own metabolism to match this threat and change the molecules of the soporific, but he felt a thrill of doubt. They'd been prepared with soporific on a blade. A soporific. Nothing to alert a poison snooper, but strong enough to slow the muscles it touched. His enemies had their own plans within plans, their own stacked treacheries. 
    Again Feyd-Rautha leaped, stabbing.
    Paul, the smile frozen on his face, feinted with slowness as though inhibited by the drug and at the last instant dodged to meet the downflashing arm on the crysknife's point.
    Feyd-Rautha ducked sideways and was out and away, his blade shifted to his left hand, and the measure of him that only a slight paleness of jaw betrayed the acid pain where Paul had cut him.
    Let him know his own moment of doubt, Paul thought. Let him suspect poison.
    "Treachery!" Feyd-Rautha shouted. "He's poisoned me! I do feel poison in my arm!"
    Paul dropped his cloak of silence, said: "Only a little acid to counter the soporific on the Emperor's blade."
    Feyd-Rautha matched Paul's cold smile, lifted blade in left hand for a mock salute. His eyes glared rage behind the knife.
    Paul shifted his crysknife to his left hand, matching his opponent. Again, they circled, probing.
    Feyd-Rautha began closing the space between them, edging in, knife held high, anger showing itself in squint of eye and set of jaw. He feinted right and under, and they were pressed against each other, knife hands gripped, straining.
    Paul, cautious of Feyd-Rautha's right hip where he suspected a poison flip-dart, forced the turn to the right. He almost failed to see the needlepoint flick out beneath the belt line. A shift and a giving in Feyd-Rautha's motion warned him. The tiny point missed Paul's flesh by the barest fraction. 
    On the left hip!
    Treachery within treachery within treachery, Paul reminded himself. Using Bene Gesserit-trained muscles, he sagged to catch a reflex in Feyd-Rautha, but the necessity of avoiding the tiny point jutting from his opponent's hip threw Paul off just enough that he missed his footing and found himself thrown hard to the floor, Feyd-Rautha on top.
    "You see it there on my hip?" Feyd-Rautha whispered. "Your death, fool." And he began twisting himself around, forcing the poisoned needle closer and closer. "It'll stop your muscles and my knife will finish you. There'll be never a trace left to detect!"
    Paul strained, hearing the silent screams in his mind, his cell-stamped ancestors demanding that he use the secret word to slow Feyd-Rautha, to save himself. 
    "I will not say it!" Paul gasped.
    Feyd-Rautha gaped at him, caught in the merest fraction of hesitation. It was enough for Paul to find the weakness of balance in one of his opponent's leg muscles, and their positions were reversed. Feyd-Rautha lay partly underneath with right hip high, unable to turn because of the tiny needlepoint caught against the floor beneath him.
    Paul twisted his left hand free, aided by the lubrication of blood from his arm, thrust once hard up underneath Feyd-Rautha's jaw. The point slid home into the brain. Feyd-Rautha jerked and sagged back, still held partly on his side by the needle imbedded in the floor.
    Breathing deeply to restore his calm, Paul pushed himself away and got to his feet. He stood over the body, knife in hand, raised his eyes with deliberate slowness to look across the room at the Emperor.
    "Majesty," Paul said, "your force is reduced by one more. Shall we now shed sham and pretense? Shall we now discuss what must be? Your daughter wed to me and the way opened for an Atreides to sit on the throne."
    The Emperor turned, looked at Count Fenring. The Count met his stare -- gray eyes against green. The thought lay there clearly between them, their association so long that understanding could be achieved with a glance.
    Kill this upstart for me, the Emperor was saying. The Atreides is young and resourceful, yes -- but he is also tired from long effort and he'd be no match for you, anyway. Call him out now . . . you know the way of it. Kill him.
    Slowly, Fenring moved his head, a prolonged turning until he faced Paul.
    "Do it!" the Emperor hissed.
    The Count focused on Paul, seeing with eyes his Lady Margot had trained in the Bene Gesserit way, aware of the mystery and hidden grandeur about this Atreides youth.
    I could kill him, Fenring thought -- and he knew this for a truth.
    Something in his own secretive depths stayed the Count then, and he glimpsed briefly, inadequately, the advantage he held over Paul -- a way of hiding from the youth, a furtiveness of person and motives that no eye could penetrate.
    Paul, aware of some of this from the way the time nexus boiled, understood at last why he had never seen Fenring along the webs of prescience. Fenring was one of the might-have-beens, an almost Kwisatz Haderach, crippled by a flaw in the genetic pattern -- a eunuch, his talent concentrated into furtiveness and inner seclusion. A deep compassion for the Count flowed through Paul, the first sense of brotherhood he'd ever experienced.
    Fenring, reading Paul's emotion, said, "Majesty, I must refuse."
    Rage overcame Shaddam IV. He took two short steps through the entourage, cuffed Fenring viciously across the jaw.
    A dark flush spread up and over the Count's face. He looked directly at the Emperor, spoke with deliberate lack of emphasis: "We have been friends, Majesty. What I do now is out of friendship. I shall forget that you struck me."
    Paul cleared his throat, said: "We were speaking of the throne, Majesty."
    The Emperor whirled, glared at Paul. "I sit on the throne!" he barked.
    "You shall have a throne on Salusa Secundus," Paul said.
    "I put down my arms and came here on your word of bond!" the Emperor shouted. "You dare threaten --"
    "Your person is safe in my presence," Paul said. "An Atreides promised it. Muad'Dib, however, sentences you to your prison planet. But have no fear, Majesty. I will ease the harshness of the place with all the powers at my disposal. It shall become a garden world, full of gentle things."
    As the hidden import of Paul's words grew in the Emperor's mind, he glared across the room at Paul. "Now we see true motives," he sneered. 
    "Indeed," Paul said.
    "And what of Arrakis?" the Emperor asked. "Another garden world full of gentle things?"
    "The Fremen have the word of Muad'Dib," Paul said. "There will be flowing water here open to the sky and green oases rich with good things. But we have the spice to think of, too. Thus, there will always be desert on Arrakis . . . and fierce winds, and trials to toughen a man. We Fremen have a saying: 'God created Arrakis to train the faithful.' One cannot go against the word of God." 
    The old Truthsayer, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, had her own view of the hidden meaning in Paul's words now. She glimpsed the jihad and said: "You cannot loose these people upon the universe!"
    "You will think back to the gentle ways of the Sardaukar!" Paul snapped.
    "You cannot," she whispered.
    "You're a Truthsayer," Paul said. "Review your words." He glanced at the Princess Royal, back to the Emperor. "Best be done quickly, Majesty."
    The Emperor turned a stricken look upon his daughter. She touched his arm, spoke soothingly: "For this I was trained, Father." 
    He took a deep breath.
    "You cannot stay this thing," the old Truthsayer muttered.
    The Emperor straightened, standing stiffly with a look of remembered dignity. "Who will negotiate for you, kinsman?" he asked.
    Paul turned, saw his mother, her eyes heavy-lidded, standing with Chani in a squad of Fedaykin guards. He crossed to them, stood looking down at Chani.
    "I know the reasons," Chani whispered. "If it must be . . . Usul."
    Paul, hearing the secret tears in her voice, touched her cheek. "My Sihaya need fear nothing, ever," he whispered. He dropped his arm, faced his mother. "You will negotiate for me. Mother, with Chani by your side. She has wisdom and sharp eyes. And it is wisely said that no one bargains tougher than a Fremen. She will be looking through the eyes of her love for me and with the thought of her sons to be, what they will need. Listen to her." 
    Jessica sensed the harsh calculation in her son, put down a shudder. "What are your instructions?" she asked.
    "The Emperor's entire CHOAM Company holdings as dowry," he said.
    "Entire?" She was shocked almost speechless.
    "He is to be stripped. I'll want an earldom and CHOAM directorship for Gurney Halleck, and him in the fief of Caladan. There will be titles and attendant power for every surviving Atreides man, not excepting the lowliest trooper." 
    "What of the Fremen?" Jessica asked.
    "The Fremen are mine," Paul said. "What they receive shall be dispensed by Muad'Dib. It'll begin with Stilgar as Governor on Arrakis, but that can wait." 
    "And for me?" Jessica asked. 
    "Is there something you wish?"
    "Perhaps Caladan," she said, looking at Gurney. "I'm not certain. I've become too much the Fremen . . . and the Reverend Mother. I need a time of peace and stillness in which to think." 
    "That you shall have," Paul said, "and anything else that Gurney or I can give you."
    Jessica nodded, feeling suddenly old and tired. She looked at Chani. "And for the royal concubine?" 
    "No title for me," Chani whispered. "Nothing. I beg of you." 
    Paul stared down into her eyes, remembering her suddenly as she had stood once with little Leto in her arms, their child now dead in this violence. "I swear to you now," he whispered, "that you'll need no title. That woman over there will be my wife and you but a concubine because this is a political thing and we must weld peace out of this moment, enlist the Great Houses of the Landsraad. We must obey the forms. Yet that princess shall have no more of me than my name. No child of mine nor touch nor softness of glance, nor instant of desire."
    "So you say now," Chani said. She glanced across the room at the tail princess.
    "Do you know so little of my son?" Jessica whispered. "See that princess standing there, so haughty and confident. They say she has pretensions of a literary nature. Let us hope she finds solace in such things; she'll have little else." A bitter laugh escaped Jessica. "Think on it, Chani: that princess will have the name, yet she'll live as less than a concubine -- never to know a moment of tenderness from the man to whom she's bound. While we, Chani, we who carry the name of concubine -- history will call us wives."
